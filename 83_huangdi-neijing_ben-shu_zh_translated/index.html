<p>19: 春取絡脈諸滎大經分肉之間，甚者深取之，間者淺取之。夏取諸俞孫絡肌肉皮膚之上。秋取諸合，餘如春法。冬取諸井諸俞之分，欲深而留之。此四時之序，氣之所處，病之所舍，藏之所宜。轉筋者，立而取之，可令遂已。痿厥者，張而刺之，可令立快也。
According to the text, the translation for the given literary Chinese passage is as follows: </p>
<p>In Spring, taking the Chong and Ren meridians, one should deeply take from the deep and shallow points. In Summer, take from the Guan sun channels, muscles, and skin. In Autumn, follow the Spring method. In Winter, take from the Jing and Guan of the Chong and Guan channels, leaving it deep if desired. This is the sequence for the four seasons, the placement of Qi, where illnesses reside, and how to store them. For adjusting the sinews, stand and take them, which can ensure success. For flaccid paralysis or stroke, spread and needle them, which can make one recover quickly.</p>
<p>Remember, medical practitioners should always consult with their patients and refer to standard medical practices before applying any kind of treatment.</p>
