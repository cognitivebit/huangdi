<h1 id="_1">平人氣象論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：平人何如。歧伯對曰：人一呼脈再動，一吸脈亦再動，呼吸定息脈五動，閏以太息，命曰平人。平人者，不病也。常以不病調病人，醫不病，故為病人平息以調之為法。人一呼脈一動，一吸脈一動，曰少氣。人一呼脈三動，一吸脈三動而躁，尺熱曰病溫，尺不熱脈滑曰病風，脈濇曰痺。人一呼脈四動以上曰死，脈絕不至曰死，乍踈乍數曰死。
Emperor Yellow asked: What is a person in a state of equilibrium? The Duke answered: A person's pulse quickens when they inhale and when they exhale, the five movements of respiration are harmonious. When one rests between breaths, it is called a person in a state of equilibrium. A person in a state of equilibrium is not sick. Doctors often use equilibriums to treat sick patients. A person's pulse moves when they inhale and when they exhale, it is said that there is a lack of qi. If a person's pulse moves three times when they inhale and exhale, they become agitated, an elevated pulse indicates a fever, and if the pulse is slippery but not elevated, it indicates wind sickness. A pulse that is irregular is called paralysis. If a person's pulse moves four or more times with one breath, it is said to be dying, and if the pulse suddenly stops, it is also considered dying.</p>
<p>2: 平人之常氣稟於胃，胃者，平人之常氣也，人无胃氣曰逆，逆者死。春胃微弦曰平，弦多胃少曰肝病，但弦无胃曰死，胃而有毛曰秋病，毛甚曰今病。藏真散於肝，肝藏勱膜之氣也。夏胃微鉤曰平，鉤多胃少曰心病，但鉤无胃曰死，胃而有石曰冬病，石甚曰今病。藏真通於心，心藏血脈之氣也。長夏胃微耎弱曰平，弱多胃少曰脾病，但代无胃曰死，耎弱有石曰冬病，弱甚曰今病。藏真濡於脾，脾藏肌肉之氣也。秋胃微毛曰平，毛多胃少曰肺病，但毛无胃曰死，毛而有弦曰春病，弦甚曰今病。藏真高於肺，以行榮衛陰陽也。冬胃微石曰平，石多胃少曰腎病，但石无胃曰死，石而有鉤曰夏病，鉤甚曰今病。藏真下於腎，腎藏骨髓之氣也。胃之大絡，名曰虛里，貫鬲絡肺，出於左乳下，其動應衣，脈宗氣也。盛喘數絕者，則病在中；結而橫，有積矣；絕不至曰死。乳之下其動應衣，宗氣泄也。
The balance of Qi is located in the stomach, and the stomach is where the balance of Qi resides. When there is no stomach Qi, it is called reversal, which results in death. In spring, when the Qi is thin and weak, it is called a balanced state. If the Qi is excessive and the stomach is weak, it is diagnosed as liver disease. However, if there is no Qi in the stomach, it is referred to as winter illness, and if it's severe, it's considered today's disease. When there are hairs on the stomach, it indicates autumn illness. If the hairs are excessive and the stomach is weak, it is diagnosed as lung disease. But if there are no Qi in the stomach, it's referred to as spring illness, and if it's severe, it's considered today's disease. The genuine Qi resides in the lungs, which controls the defense of yin and yang. When the Qi is microscopic and weak, it is called a balanced state. If the Qi is excessive and the stomach is weak, it is diagnosed as spleen disease. If there are stones in the stomach, it indicates winter illness. If it's severe, it's considered today's disease. The genuine Qi flows through the spleen, which nourishes the muscles. When the Qi is thin and weak, it's called a balanced state. If the Qi is excessive and the stomach is weak, it's diagnosed as liver disease. But if there are no Qi in the stomach, it's referred to as winter illness, and if it's severe, it's considered today's disease. The genuine Qi resides in the kidneys, which govern the bones and marrow. The meridian of the stomach, known as Xi Cleft, passes through the lung and exits from the left breast, representing the protective Qi and pulse. When there is persistent coughing, it indicates an illness within the body; if it's blocked, it has accumulated; if it doesn't reach the point of death. Beneath the breast, the pulse represents the protective Qi flowing out as a leak.</p>
<p>3: 欲知寸口太過與不及，寸口之脈中手短者，曰頭痛。寸口脈中手長者，曰足脛痛。寸口脈中手促上擊者，曰肩背痛。寸口脈沈而堅者，曰病在中。寸口脈浮而盛者，曰病在外。寸口脈沈而弱，曰寒熱及疝瘕少腹痛。寸口脈沈而橫，曰脇下有積，腹中有橫積痛。寸口脈沈而喘，曰寒熱。脈盛滑堅者，曰病在外。脈小實而堅者，病在內。脈小弱以濇，謂之久病。脈滑浮而疾者，謂之新病。脈急者，曰疝瘕少腹痛。脈滑曰風。脈濇曰痺。緩而滑曰熱中。盛而緊曰脹。
To determine the location of a patient's illness, the speed and depth of the pulse at the inch point can be analyzed. If the pulse is shallow and short, it indicates head pain. If the pulse is deep and long, it indicates ankle pain. If the pulse is abrupt and strong, it suggests shoulder and back pain. A sinking and firm pulse indicates that the disease is in the center. A floating and abundant pulse indicates that the disease is outside. A sinking and weak pulse suggests cold and heat, as well as pain in the groin, lower abdomen, or sciatica. A sinking and horizontal pulse indicates a lump in the loins and pain in the abdomen. A sinking and panting pulse suggests cold and heat. A full and slippery pulse indicates that the disease is outside. A small and real pulse with firmness implies an internal illness. If the pulse is small, weak, and unclear, it means a long-standing illness. A rapid and slippery pulse indicates a recent illness. A rushing pulse suggests pain in the lower abdomen, groin, or sciatica. A slick pulse suggests wind. A sluggish and slippery pulse suggests fever. A full and tight pulse suggests distention.</p>
<p>4: 脈從陰陽，病易已；脈逆陰陽，病難已。脈得四時之順，曰病无他；脈反四時及不閒藏，曰難已。
The pulse arises from yin and yang, and the disease is easy to understand; when the pulse is reversed in yin and yang, the disease is difficult. When the pulse follows the four seasons, it means that there is no other disease; when the pulse does not follow the four seasons and is not idle, it means that it is difficult.</p>
<p>5: 臂多青脈，曰脫血。尺脈緩濇，謂之解㑊，安臥脈盛，謂之脫血。尺濇脈滑，謂之多汗。尺寒脈細，謂之後泄。脈尺麤常熱者，謂之熱中。
A plentiful arm and green tendons; it is called blood letting. A slow, thin pulse, called 'separating the bones', a full resting pulse, called blood letting. A slippery pulse in the small yang channel, called much sweating. A cold and thin pulse in the small yang channel, called after urinating. A warm and constant pulse in the foot jueyin, called feverishness.</p>
<p>Note: This translation assumes that the text is written in classical Chinese and refers to traditional Chinese medicine concepts. The original text seems to be a description of different pulse readings and their corresponding conditions or interpretations according to traditional Chinese medicine theory.</p>
<p>6: 肝見庚辛死，心見壬癸死，脾見甲乙死，肺見丙丁死，腎見戊己死，是謂真藏見皆死。
The liver sees the death of yang metal and yin water, the heart sees the death of yang fire and yin earth, the spleen sees the death of yang wood and yin metal, the lung sees the death of yang earth and yin water, the kidney sees the death of yang fire and yin wood, thus all the true secrets are seen to be dead.</p>
<p>7: 頸脈動喘疾欬，曰水。目裏微腫如臥蠶起之狀，曰水。溺黃赤安臥者，黃疸。已食如飢者，胃疸。面腫曰風。足脛腫曰水。目黃者曰黃疸。
Pulse quick and panting, saying water. The eyes slightly swollen, like a worm emerging from its cocoon, saying water. Those who drowned and are lying down, have jaundice. Those who have already eaten but feel as if they're hungry, have stomach abscesses. Swelling of the face says wind. Swelling of the calves says water. If the eyes are yellow, it is called jaundice.</p>
<p>8: 婦人手少陰脈動甚者，妊子也。
A woman with a weak pulse in the palm shall be pregnant</p>
<p>9: 脈有逆從四時，未有藏形，春夏而脈瘦，秋冬而脈浮大，命曰逆四時也。風熱而脈靜，泄而脫血脈實，病在中，脈虛，病在外，脈濇堅者，皆難治，命曰反四時也。
The pulse follows the four seasons and has no hidden changes; in spring and summer, the pulse is thin, and in autumn and winter, it is full and large. This is called pulse according to the four seasons. When there is heat and wind, the pulse is calm; when it leaks, there is bleeding, and the pulse becomes real, the disease is inside. If the pulse is empty, the disease is outside, and if the pulse is scattered and stiff, they are all difficult to treat, called reverse the four seasons.</p>
<p>10: 人以水穀為本，故人絕水穀則死，脈無胃氣亦死。所謂無胃氣者，但得真藏脈不得胃氣也。所謂脈不得胃氣者，肝不弦腎不石也。太陽脈至，洪大以長；少陽脈至，乍數乍踈，乍短乍長；陽明脈至，浮大而短。夫平心脈來，累累如連珠，如循琅玕，曰心平，夏以胃氣為本。病心脈來，喘喘連屬，其中微曲，曰心病。死心脈來，前曲後居，如操帶鉤，曰心死。平肺脈來，厭厭聶聶，如落榆莢，曰肺平，秋以胃氣為本。病肺脈來，不上不下，如循雞羽，曰肺病。死肺脈來，如物之浮，如風吹毛，曰肺死。平肝脈來，耎弱招招，如揭長竿末梢，曰肝平，春以胃氣為本。病肝脈來，盈實而滑，如循長竿，曰肝病。死肝脈來，急益勁，如新張弓弦，曰肝死。平脾脈來，和柔相離，如雞踐地，曰脾平，長夏以胃氣為本。病脾脈來，實而盈數，如雞舉足，曰脾病。死脾脈來，銳堅如烏之喙，如鳥之距，如屋之漏，如水之流，曰脾死。平腎脈來，喘喘累累如鉤，按之而堅，曰腎平，冬以胃氣為本。病腎脈來，如引葛，按之益堅，曰腎病。死腎脈來，發如奪索，辟辟如彈石，曰腎死。
People rely on grain and water as their basis, so if a person lacks grain and water, they will die. If there is no Qi in the Conception Vessel (Ren Mai) but true Sea of Qi (Yuan Shen) is present, then one will still not die. When the Qi does not reach the Conception Vessel, the Liver and Kidney do not function properly. The Sun and Lesser Yin channels are long when they arrive; the Former Heaven and Latter Heaven channels are irregular in length. When the Heart channel comes evenly, like a string of pearls or a continuous jade disc, it indicates that the heart is at peace. If the channel from the heart is disordered, wheezing and unstable, it means the heart is not at ease. If the channel from the heart becomes twisted and stays in the back, it means the heart has stopped functioning. When the Lung channel arrives evenly, like fallen bamboo shoots, it indicates that the lungs are at peace. If the channel from the lungs is disordered, rising and falling unpredictably, it means the lungs are not at ease. If the channel from the lungs floats erratically, like a feather in the wind, it means the lungs have stopped functioning. When the Liver channel arrives calmly, weak and gentle, like the tip of a long staff, it indicates that the liver is at peace. If the Liver channel is full and slippery, like a long staff, it means the liver is not at ease. If the Liver channel becomes tense and forceful, like a newly stretched bowstring, it means the liver has stopped functioning. When the Spleen channel arrives evenly, soft and gentle, like a chicken's footsteps, it indicates that the spleen is at peace. If the Spleen channel is full and present, like a chicken raising its leg, it means the spleen is not at ease. If the Spleen channel becomes sharp and rigid, like a crow's beak, like a bird's distance, like a crack in a wall, like a leaking stream, it means the spleen has stopped functioning. When the Kidney channel arrives evenly, wheezing and accumulating, it indicates that the kidneys are at peace. If the channel from the kidneys is disordered, becoming increasingly rigid, it means the kidneys are not at ease. If the channel from the kidneys comes like a noose, leaping and bounding like a bouncing ball, it means the kidneys have stopped functioning.</p>
