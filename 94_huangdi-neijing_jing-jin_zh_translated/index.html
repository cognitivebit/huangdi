The Jīn Chūn Yuán is an acupuncture point located on the foot Yang Míng channel, starting at the middle finger's metacarpophalangeal joint and ending at the heel.

Translation: The channels of the foot yang minor and foot shao yin originate from below the little toe and unite with the great yang channel, ascending to join the jue yin channel at the renal depression, forming a loop around the genitals and joining the bladder channel at the occuput, uniting with the great yang channel. Patients with pain in these channels or along the course of the channels will have pain. Diseases arising from within cannot be pulled outward, and those arising internally cannot be elevated. Therefore, diseases of yang channels result in a reversed lumbar curvature that cannot be straightened, while diseases of yin channels result in an inability to be elevated. Treatment involves needle insertion at the appropriate points, using a counter-irritant and draining method, and internally administering heat-producing medicine. If this channel becomes twisted and knotted, the cord will emit signs of danger; if severe, it is fatal and is known as qu zhi yin.</p>

The ligament of the foot's yin (Flexor Hallucis Longus) begins at the top of the big toe, ascends to the front of the inner ankle, loops around the tibia, connects to the adductor muscles, loops around the pubic bone, and attaches to the genitals. When this ligament is injured, there will be pain at the big toe supporting the inner ankle, the adductor muscles, the pubic bone, and difficulty using the genitals. If injured internally, it will not rise; if injured by cold, the yin will retract; if injured by heat, it will stand erect and not retract. Treatment for this condition involves regulating water and clearing the yin energy; for those with pain that refers to other areas (referred pain), treatment involves needing and cupping at strategic points, identifying the pain as Seasonal Imbalance of Qi.</p>

The hand Yang meridian begins at the upper part of the little finger, passes through to the wrist, ascends along the inner aspect of the arm and terminates at the interior sharp bone behind the elbow, twists towards the little finger above and enters into the axillary fossa. Its branch goes downward following the rear aspect of the arm, ascends around the shoulder blade, loops around the clavicle and exits to the front of the yang meridian, terminating at the mastoid process behind the skull bone. Its branch goes into the ear canal. The directing vessel goes out from the top of the ear, descends and terminates at the lower lip, belonging to the outer aspect of the eyebrow. If there is disease affecting the little finger, wrist, interior sharp bone, inner aspect of the arm, axillary fossa, shoulder blade, clavicle, or skull bone, it causes pain. When it spreads downward and causes pain in the throat, it refers to the ear, causing ear pain and causing pain at the lower lip, leading to temporary loss of vision before recovery. If the throat muscle is tight, this can cause yang muscle swelling and neck inflammation, with cold or heat in the neck area. Treatment involves using acupuncture and moxibustion on the jueyin and shaoyang points along the meridian, following the pain for guidance. For swelling, needle in the opposite direction. This is known as the Xia Zhi syndrome.</p>

<p>手少陽之筋，起於小指次指之端，結於腕，中循臂，結於肘，上繞臑外廉、上肩、走頸，合手太陽；其支者，當曲頰入繫舌本；其支者，上曲牙，循耳前，屬目外眥，上乘頷，結於角。其病當所過者，即支轉筋，舌卷。治在燔鍼劫刺，以知為數，以痛為輸，名曰季夏痺也。
The hand's Yang channel begins at the root of the little and ring fingers, passes through the wrist, ascends along the arm, terminates at the elbow, goes around the outside of the elbow, across the shoulder, down the neck, and joins with the other hand's Yang channel. Its connecting point is at the lower lip, attached to the root of the tongue; another connecting point is at the upper gum, ascending in front of the ear, belonging to the external sense organ of the eye, ascending to the mouth, terminating at the horn. When disease occurs along this channel, it manifests as numbness and turning of the affected limb, with the tongue rolling up. The treatment involves needling at the Luo connective point, eliciting a sensation of distending fullness, and releasing, in the context of the Jisheng (Seasonal Evil) invasion. This is known as the Jisheng Syndrome.</p>

<p>手陽明之筋，起於大指次指之端，結於腕，上循臂，上結於肘外，上臑，結於髃；其支者，繞肩胛，挾脊；直者，從肩髃上頸；其支者，上頰，結於頄；直者，上出手太陽之前，上左角，絡頭，下右頷。其病當所過者，支痛及轉筋，肩不舉，頸不可左右視。治在燔鍼劫刺，以知為數，以痛為輸，名曰孟夏痺也。
The Hand Yang Ming Meridian starts at the tip of the thumb and index finger, ascends along the arm, terminates outside the elbow, runs to the wrist, connects with the hair. The branch is wrapped around the shoulder blade and hugs the spine; it goes straight from the nape of the neck to the top of the head; its branch goes up to the forehead, connects at the temples.

The sinew of the hand's yin is located above the great finger, and follows along the finger, terminates at the fish's tail, goes outward from the inch, loops up the arm, terminates in the elbow's center, enters the armpit's interior, exits the uterus' basin, terminates at the shoulder in front of the hair, loops up at the uterus' basin, and terminates inside the chest cavity. It disperses to the tendons and connects to the seasonal gates. When there is illness along its course, the sinew transforms and becomes painful, causing difficulty in breathing and urging vomiting of blood. Treatment involves inserting a needle at Gushing Spring and Bamboo Mound, counting the number of insertions, and treating according to pain. It is called Zhongtan (Middle Winter) Jian.</p>

<p>手心主之筋，起於中指，與太陰之筋並行，結於肘內廉，上臂陰，結腋下，下散前後挾脅；其支者，入腋，散胸中，結於臂。其病當所過者，支轉筋前及胸痛息賁。治在燔鍼劫刺，以知為數，以痛為輸，名曰孟冬痺也。
The sinew of the hand's heart, originates from the middle finger, runs parallel with the Conception channel, connects at the inner elbow crease, reaches the anterior aspect of the upper arm, spreads downward and extends across the chest; its connecting point is located within the axilla. Its course follows a path beneath the breastbone, connects to the arm, and disperses above and below the chest. When it encounters disease, it manifests as turning cold, pain in the sinew channel, and chest pain with difficulty breathing. Treatment lies in needle insertion at the appropriate points along the sinew channel, following the direction of the pain, and is called Meng Dong Jian.</p>

<p>手少陰之筋，起於小指之內側，結於銳骨，上結肘內廉，上入腋，交太陰，挾乳裏，結於胸中，循臂下繫於臍。其病內急心承伏梁，下為肘網。其病當所過者，支轉筋，筋痛。治在燔鍼劫刺，以知為數，以痛為輸。其成伏梁唾血膿者，死不治。經筋之病，寒則反折筋急，熱則筋弛縱不收，陰痿不用。陽急則反折，陰急則俛不伸。焠刺者，刺寒急也，熱則筋縱不收，無用燔鍼，名曰季冬痺也。
The hand's yin muscles, beginning inside the little finger and ending at the acromion, pass through the armpit, unite with the conception vessel, embrace the breast, and connect to the chest at the serratus anterior muscle, and descend along the medial side of the arm. When there is disease along its course, it turns and causes pain in the muscles. Treatment involves piercing with an awl or needle, using knowledge as the method and pain as the guide. If the disease leads to a collapse of the trapezius muscle and bleeding of blood and pus, it cannot be cured. The diseases of the channel of the yin muscle are characterized by pain when cold, causing the muscles to contract and spasm. When hot, the muscles become flaccid and do not retract. Deficiency of yin leads to a Yang urgency that causes contraction, and deficiency of yang leads to an inability to stretch. In the case of piercing with an awl or needle, it is for treating pain caused by cold, but if there is heat, the muscles do not retract and are untreatable with moxibustion. This is known as seasonal rigidity (Ji Dong Li).</p>
