<h1 id="_1">脈要精微論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：診法何如。歧伯對曰：診法常以平旦，陰氣未動，陽氣未散，飲食未進，經脈未盛，絡脈調勻，氣血未亂，故乃可診有過之脈。切脈動靜而視精明，察五色，觀五藏有餘不足，六府強弱，形之盛衰，以此參伍決死生之分。
The Yellow Emperor asked, How is the method of diagnosis? The Duke of Shou replied, Diagnosis is usually done at noon when the yin energy has not yet moved and the yang energy has not yet dispersed. Food and drink have not been taken in yet, and the channels are not full. The network vessels are in balance, and there is no confusion in the Qi and blood. Therefore, it is possible to diagnose a patient's excesses by feeling the pulse. He said, If the pulse is active or still, one must observe the clarity of the mind. Examine the five colors, observe whether the five organs have enough or lack something, assess the strength or weakness of the six departments, determine the abundance or decline of the body form, and use all these factors to distinguish between life and death.</p>
<p>2: 夫脈者，血之府也，長則氣治，短則氣病，數則煩心，大則病進，上盛則氣高，下盛則氣脹，代則氣衰，細則氣少，濇則心痛，渾渾革至如涌泉，病進而色弊，緜緜其去如弦絕，死。夫精明五色者，氣之華也。赤欲如白裹朱，不欲如赭；白欲如鵝羽，不欲如鹽；青欲如蒼璧之澤，不欲如藍；黃欲如羅裹雄黃，不欲如黃土；黑欲如重漆色，不欲如地蒼。五色精微象見矣，其壽不久也。夫精明者，所以視萬物，別白黑，審短長。以長為短，以白為黑，如是則精衰矣。
The pulse, or beckoning, refers to the dwelling place of blood. When it is long, the qi is regulated; when short, there is a qi disorder; when irregular, there is disturbance of the heart-spirit; when deep, disease progresses; when full on top, there is a sensation of high qi; when full below, there is a sensation of bloated qi; if intermittent, there is decline of qi; if subtle, there is insufficiency of qi; if weakened, there is pain in the heart; if chaotic, like gushing springs, disease progresses and color deteriorates, like broken strings, leading to death. The radiant purity of the five colors refers to the flowering of qi. Red desires to be white, like vermillion wrappings; yellow desires to be white, like alum; green desires to be as clear as a jade basin, not like indigo; yellow desires to be like the golden wrapping of a phoenix, not like yellow earth; black desires to be like the glossy color of lacquer, not like the blue of the sky. The five colors, radiant and subtle, have appeared, but their longevity is brief. The one who perceives and discerns myriad things, distinguishing white from black, judging long and short: if he favors the short over the long, and the black over the white, then he will decline in vitality</p>
<p>3: 藏者，中之守也，中盛藏滿，氣勝傷恐者，聲如從室中言，是中氣之濕也。言而微，終日乃復言者，此奪氣也。衣被不斂，言語善惡，不避親踈者，此神明之亂也。倉廩不藏者，是門戶不要也。水泉不止者，是膀胱不藏也。得守者生，失守者死。夫五藏者，身之強也，頭者精明之府，頭傾視深，精神將奪矣。背者胸中之府，背曲肩隨，府將壞矣。腰者腎之府，轉搖不能，腎將憊矣。膝者筋之府，屈伸不能，行則僂附，筋將憊矣。骨者髓之府，不能久立，行則振掉，骨將憊矣。得強則生，失強則死。
The one who keeps it is the master of the center, and when the center is full, the qi prevails over injury and fear, its voice is like speaking from inside a room, this is the dampness of the center's qi. The words are soft and subtle, all day long they change into more such words, this is losing the qi. Clothing and bedding not properly adjusted, speech good or bad, not avoiding close relatives, this is disorder of spirit and light. A warehouse without a storehouse is because the doors and windows are not closed. Springs and wells that do not stop are because the bladder is not stored. Those who have guarded it live, those who have lost it die. The five stores are the strength of the body, the head is the residence of spirit, tilting the head to look deeply, the spirit is about to be taken away. The back is the repository of the chest, bending the shoulders when the back is curved, the repository is about to deteriorate. The waist is the repository of the kidneys, unable to rotate and sway, the kidneys are about to ache. The knees are the repositories of tendons, unable to bend and straighten, walking causes them to hang and drag, the tendons are about to ache. Bones are the repositories of marrow, unable to stand for a long time, walking causes them to sway and wobble, the bones are about to ache. Those who have strength will live, those who lose strength will die.</p>
<p>4: 歧伯曰：反四時者，有餘為精，不足為消。應太過，不足為精；應不足，有餘為消。陰陽不相應，病名曰關格。帝曰：脈其四時動柰何，知病之所在柰何，知病之所變奈何，知病乍在內柰何，知病乍在外奈何，請問此五者，可得聞乎。歧伯曰：請言其與天運轉大也。萬物之外，六合之內，天地之變，陰陽之應，彼春之暖，為夏之暑，彼秋之忿，為冬之怒，四變之動，脈與之上下，以春應中規，夏應中矩，秋應中衡，冬應中權。是故冬至四十五日，陽氣微上，陰氣微下；夏至四十五日，陰氣微上，陽氣微下。陰陽有時，與脈為期，期而相失，知脈所分，分之有期，故知死時。微妙在脈，不可不察，察之有紀，從陰陽始，始之有經，從五行生，生之有度，四時為宜，補寫勿失，與天地如一，得一之情，以知死生。是故聲合五音，色合五行，脈合陰陽，是知陰盛則夢涉大水恐懼，陽盛則夢大火燔灼，陰陽俱盛則夢相殺毀傷；上盛則夢飛，下盛則夢墮；甚飽則夢予，甚飢則夢取；肝氣盛則夢怒，肺氣盛則夢哭；短蟲多則夢聚眾，長蟲多則夢相擊毀傷。是故持脈有道，虛靜為保。春日浮，如魚之遊在波；夏日在膚，泛泛乎萬物有餘；秋日下膚，蟄蟲將去；冬日在骨，蟄蟲周密，君子居室。故曰：知內者按而紀之，知外者終而始之。此六者，持脈之大法。
Obo said: In regards to the four seasons, there is a surplus of essence in excess and not enough for dissipation. Over-application results in insufficiency for essence, and insufficiency has a surplus for dissipation. The Yin and Yang do not correspond; this is called Guan Mu. Emperor asked: What is the dynamic of the pulse at the four seasons? How do we locate the source of the disease? How does the disease change? Where is the disease within? Where is the disease without? Please ask about these five things, can I hear it? Obo said: Please ask about the cycle of heavenly fate. Beyond all things, the six alignments inside; the transformation of heaven and earth, the correspondence of Yin and Yang, spring's warmth becoming summer's heat, autumn's rage becoming winter's anger, the four changes in motion, the pulse with them above and below, following the spring's median rule, the summer's median gauge, the autumn's median balance, the winter's median authority. Therefore, when winter reaches forty-five days, the Yang Qi is slightly rising, the Yin Qi is slightly descending; when summer reaches forty-five days, the Yin Qi is slightly rising, the Yang Qi is slightly descending. The correspondence of Yin and Yang has a time, which time they lose each other, knowing the pulse's division, dividing it has a time, thus knowing the time of death. Subtlety is in the pulse, not to be overlooked; examining it has records, starting from Yin and Yang, there are canons, starting from the Five Phases, having degrees of the generation, the four seasons being suitable, supplementing and not missing, corresponding with heaven and earth like one, knowing life and death. Therefore, blending the five tones, merging the five colors, merging the pulse with Yin and Yang, this knows that when Yin is dominant in dreams there are dreams of crossing great waters and being afraid, when Yang is dominant there are dreams of great fire burning and injuring, when both Yin and Yang are dominant there are dreams of killing and injuring; rising there are dreams of flying, descending there are dreams of falling; being full there are dreams of bestowing, being hungry there are dreams of taking; the Qi of the liver is dominant and there are dreams of anger, the Qi of the lung is dominant and there are dreams of crying; many worms indicate dreams of gathering crowds, many long worms indicate dreams of fighting and injuring. Therefore, holding the pulse has a way, keeping silent as protection. Spring day floating, like a fish playing in the waves; summer day on the skin, scattered among all things with some left over; autumn day beneath the skin, insects about to depart; winter day in the bones, insects tightly encircling, gentleman dwellings. Thus it is said: Knowing inside, record and examine; knowing outside, start and end. These six are the great method of holding the pulse.</p>
<p>5: 心脈搏堅而長，當病舌卷不能言；其耎而散者，當消環自已。肺脈搏堅而長，當病唾血；其耎而散者，當病灌汗，至今不復散發也。肝脈搏堅而長，色不青，當病墜若搏，因血在脅下，令人喘逆；其耎而散色澤者，當病溢飲，溢飲者渴暴多飲，而易入肌皮腸胃之外也。胃脈搏堅而長，其色赤，當病折髀；其耎而散者，當病食痺。脾脈搏堅而長，其色黃，當病少氣；其耎而散色不澤者，當病足䯒腫，若水狀也。腎脈搏堅而長，其色黃而赤者，當病折腰；其耎而散者，當病少血，至今不復也。帝曰：診得心脈而急，此為何病，病形何如。歧伯曰：病名心疝，少腹當有形也。帝曰：何以言之。歧伯曰：心為牡藏，小腸為之使，故曰少腹當有形也。帝曰：診得胃脈，病形何如。歧伯曰：胃脈實則脹，虛則泄。
The pulse is firm and prolonged, and when the tongue is tied and unable to speak during illness, it indicates heat in the liver. The person who recedes and disperses has a cold ailment. Lung pulse is firm and prolonged, indicating lung disease; the person who recedes and disperses has a sweating illness and has not yet sweated. Liver pulse is firm and prolonged, not green in color, indicating liver disease with jaundice; there is bleeding below the diaphragm, causing shortness of breath and inverse convulsions. The person who recedes and scatters, and has a yellow color, indicates excessive fluid intake, leading to thirst, excessive drinking, and easy entry into muscles, intestines, stomach, and other places. Stomach pulse is firm and prolonged, with red color, indicating knee dislocation; the person who recedes and scatters, indicating food stagnation. Spleen pulse is firm and prolonged, with yellow color, indicating shortness of breath; the person who recedes and scatters, indicating leg swelling and edema, like water.</p>
<p>The Emperor said, When diagnosing a heart pulse that is urgent, what disease is it? What is the condition? Master He said, The name of this disease is heart obstruction, and there will be a form in the lower abdomen. The Emperor asked, What about when you diagnose a stomach pulse? What is the condition? Master He said, A full stomach pulse causes distention, while an empty one causes discharge.</p>
<p>6: 帝曰：病成而變何謂。歧伯曰：風成為寒熱，癉成為消中，厥成為巔疾，久風為飱泄，脈風成為癘，病之變化，不可勝數。帝曰：諸癰腫筋攣骨痛，此皆安生。歧伯曰：此寒氣之腫，八風之變也。帝曰：治之奈何。歧伯曰：此四時之病，以其勝治之，愈也。帝曰：有故病五藏發動，因傷脈色，各何以知其久暴至之病乎。歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也。徵其脈小色不奪者，新病也；徵其脈不奪其色奪者，此久病也；徵其脈與五色俱奪者，此久病也；徵其脈與五色俱不奪者，新病也。肝與腎脈並至，其色蒼赤，當病毀傷，不見血，已見血，濕若中水也。
The Emperor asked, What is meant by the variation of a disease? Qi Bo replied, Wind becomes cold and heat, convulsions become expelling, stroke becomes acute, prolonged wind becomes diarrhea, pulse-wind becomes knots, and the variations of diseases are countless. The Emperor said, The swellings and tumors, painful sinews, and bone pains are all secure. Qi Bo replied, These are cold swellings and wind changes. The Emperor asked, How do you treat them? Qi Bo replied, The four seasonal diseases can be cured. If the disease arises from an injury to one of the five organs, then blood stagnation is the cause, and knowing this will help identify whether the illness is acute or chronic. The expert in pulse diagnosis asked, Is it indeed so? He said, If you can see the pulse but not grasp its color, it is a new disease. If the color of the pulse has been grasped but no longer persists, it is a chronic disease. If the color and pulse of the five organs have both been lost, it is a chronic disease. If the color and pulse of the five organs have not been lost, it is a new disease. The pulse and liver-kidney meridians converge, and their color is pale blue, indicating that there is an impending critical illness, but no blood has appeared; if blood appears, it is like water in a ditch.</p>

<p>8: 麤大者，陰不足陽有餘，為熱中也。來疾去徐，上實下虛，為厥巔疾；來徐去疾，上虛下實，為惡風也。故中惡風者，陽氣受也。有脈俱沈細數者，少陰厥也；沈細數散者，寒熱也；浮而散者為眴仆。諸浮不躁者皆在陽，則為熱，其有躁者在手。諸細而沈者皆在陰，則為骨痛；其有靜者在足。數動一代者，病在陽之脈也，洩及便膿血。諸過者，切之，濇者陽氣有餘也，滑者陰氣有餘也。陽氣有餘，為身熱无汗，陰氣有餘，為多汗身寒，陰陽有餘，則无汗而寒。推而外之，內而不外，有心腹積也。推而內之，外而不內，身有熱也。推而上之，上而不下，腰足清也。推而下之，下而不上，頭項痛也。按之至骨，脈氣少者，腰脊痛而身有痺也。
