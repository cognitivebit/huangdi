<h1 id="_1">六元正紀大論</h1>
<ol>
<li>黃帝問曰：六化六變，勝復淫治，甘苦辛鹹酸淡先後，余知之矣。夫五運之化，或從五氣，或逆五氣，或從天氣而逆地氣，或從地氣而逆天氣，或相得，或不相得，余未能明其事。欲通天之紀，從地之理，和其運，調其化，使上下合德，無相奪倫，天地升降，不失其宜，五運宣行，勿乖其政，調之正味，從逆柰何。歧伯稽首再拜對曰：昭乎哉問也。此天地之綱紀，變化之淵源，非聖帝孰能窮其至理歟，臣雖不敏，請陳其道，令終不滅，久而不易。帝曰：願夫子推而次之，從其類序分其部主，別其宗司，昭其氣數，明其正化，可得聞乎。歧伯曰：先立其年以明其氣，金木水火土運行之數，寒暑燥濕風火臨御之化，則天道可見，民氣可調，陰陽卷舒，近而無惑，數之可數者，請遂言之。
Yellow Emperor asked: The six transformations and six changes are victorious in treating disorders, sweet and bitter, salty and sour, and then there is mild and sharp. I know it well. As for the transformation of the five phases, it can be from the five qi or against the five qi, from the celestial qi while against the terrestrial qi or from the terrestrial qi while against the celestial qi, sometimes they match and sometimes they don't. I am unable to discern this matter. To harmonize heaven's records and understand earth's principles, regulate the phases and refine their transformations, so that above and below are in harmony with virtue, without taking each other's rights, heaven and earth ascend and descend without deviating from their proper times, the five phases unfold. Let there be no deviation of governance, refine its true taste, and follow the reversals. How can this be done?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The Duke said in response: Truly, your question is profound. This is the celestial record of heaven and earth's changes and the deep origins of transformations, which cannot be fully understood by a sacred emperor. I am not quick-witted, but please clarify your teaching so that it will never perish and become difficult to change over time. The Yellow Emperor said: I hope you can expand on this, arrange it in order, and classify its sections according to their principles, delineate its roots, make clear its proper transformations, and allow me to hear it.</p>
<p>The Duke replied: First establish the years to clarify their qi, and match the numbers of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth phases with the cold, heat, aridity, dampness, wind, and fire seasons, so that heaven's way is clear, the vitality of people can be regulated, yin and yang will be harmonious, close at hand without confusion, and the numbers that can be counted are as such, please proceed with your explanation.</p>

The political theory of Yangming, governing Heaven, is characterized by the subtle transformation of Yin and Yang after their operation. Heaven is active with Yang, while Earth is clear with Yin. This results in a predominance of Yang, bringing heat and drought to the point where things harden and become brittle; the wind blows strongly, and there is great movement in the air. There is an excess of Yang over Yin; rain clouds move towards the water regions and humidity spreads. The heat reaches its extreme while the moisture spreads, causing weeds to die and insects to appear. Water does not freeze and people suffer from diseases that alternate between cold and fever. The disease is marked by a flush in the face and swelling of the body; there is difficulty in sleeping, coughing, and vomiting; the urine is yellow or red. When Yang becomes dominant, the people relax, things flourish, and there are great honors for the people. This is followed by a benevolent government of Heaven that brings coolness and the harmonious blending of heat and drought. When Yang reaches its extreme, the land is fertile and the grain white; idle grain turns black and shrivels like feathers, while gold, fire, and brightness unite in harmony, and respond to the divine radiance of Heaven. The government changes suddenly and becomes arbitrary, causing insects to appear and water not to freeze. People suffer from diseases that alternate between fever and chills, with violent shaking, shivering, and insomnia; the hair comes out in clumps, fevers come suddenly, and parasites injure people, while their symptoms are agitated and confused. This is followed by a government of cold and rain, which causes diseases to break out violently, with convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, and pain in the heart, throat, and swellings, sores, chills, and weakness in the limbs and bleeding from the vessels. The fifth kind of climate is marked by the return of spring, when plants flourish again, and people are at peace. This brings about a harmonious balance between Heaven and Earth, bringing an end to pestilence. Those who know the subtle distinctions between heat and cold will distinguish between them and prescribe treatments accordingly. The principle is to follow nature in all things. To reverse the order of things would be disorderly and chaotic. This is a summary of the principles underlying the natural laws governing Heaven and Earth, and the cycles of Yin and Yang.</p>

This literary Chinese text describes the cycles of Yin and Yang, their effects on the weather, and how these changes influence human health. It also provides advice on balancing one's diet and lifestyle to maintain health and prevent disease. Here is the translation:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever there is an excess of Yang in governing Heaven, the vital energy flows first and precedes the operation of Yin. Heaven's energy is balanced, while Earth's energy is disturbed; winds are violent and sudden, trees sway, and fires flow. Yin operates within Yang, and rain falls in its proper season. Wood and Fire share similarities in their qualities, and they harmonize with the stars above.</p>
<p>The grains are red and blue, the government is strict, and the orders are disordered. Hence, the wind is warm and humid, clouds rise and dissipate, the Yin energy spreads horizontally, cold arrives in its proper time, and cool breezes and rain fall together. The people become sick with cold, external boils and sores appear, while internally they experience discharge.</p>
<p>When the sage encounters this situation, he harmonizes without contention. Going back and forth between these conditions, the people suffer from cold, fever, diarrhea, deafness, blindness, vomiting, and changes in complexion. The initial energy moves, Earth's energy shifts, winds prevail and shake, cold departs, the weather becomes warm, and plants flourish early.</p>
<p>Cold does not kill, but diseases arise from the heat, and these diseases reside in the upper part of the body. Their energy is stagnant within the upper part. The second energy is marked by Fire's rebellion. White dust rises everywhere, clouds gather toward the rain center, winds are too humid, rain ceases to fall, and the people become healthy.</p>
<p>In this stage, the diseases manifest as heat and rebellion, with external boils and sores appearing, the throat becoming painful, headaches accompanied by blood, fullness of the flanks and buboes, and feverish sensations. The third energy is marked by Heaven's order. The heat of summer arrives, and the Yang force nears its peak, while rain falls evenly.</p>
<p>The people suffer from heat, with internal bleeding, external boils erupting, throats becoming hoarse, blood-filled headaches accompanied by fever, dizziness, and swollen buboes. The fourth energy is marked by the cooling of the Yin and Yang forces. The weather becomes clear, and the people's vital energy returns to harmony.</p>
<p>Their bodies are heavy and full. In the fifth energy, Yang recedes, cold arrives, rain falls, and the gateway of the vital energy closes. Trees wither early, and the people avoid the cold by hiding. Sage individuals take precautions. By guiding the running energy, they applaud without end, but they must restrain the excess Yin energy, first by transforming its source, avoiding excessive violence, and preventing it from arising.</p>
<p>Thus, in each year, appropriate use of salty and sour flavors is essential, draining and expelling what is excessive, using pickling to disperse, observing the vital energy's cold and warm influences to adjust its excesses, sharing similarities with other winds that are hot but characterized by cold, other winds that are hot but less marked by cold, using heat far away from heat, using warmth far away from warmth, using cold far away from cold, and using coolness far away from coolness. In this way, their diet and lifestyle follow the proper path of health maintenance and disease prevention.</p>
<p>Anyone who is pretentious will reverse these principles, while those who are mistaken will become sick. Sickness is a measure of one's progress up the ladder, while mistakes occur in those with false understanding. These words describe the stages through which people pass as they move towards health or illness.</p>

The text describes the change of seasons and its effects on people's health, depending on the balance between yin and yang energies. It provides advice on how to maintain good health by adapting to the changing seasons and regulating one's diet accordingly. Here is a rough translation:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding this excessive yin governing heaven, after the transformation of qi flows, the yin emphasizes its politics, while yang qi retreats. When great winds arise, heavenly qi descends, and earthly qi rises; the original wilderness becomes misty and white dust arises in four directions, as clouds rush to the south pole. Cold rain falls frequently, and things reach a state of midsummer. The people suffer from cold dampness, their bellies are full, and their limbs swell with anger and distension; chills, cold obstructions, and urgent urgency afflict them; damp-cold combine, and white and black dust arises, spreading epidemics as the stars of the palace and the purveyor [constellations] rise.</p>
<p>Their politics are stern, their decrees quiet, and their grains are dull and dark. Therefore, yin accumulates above, cold accumulates below; cold water defeats fire, resulting in hail or frost. Yang light cannot cure, causing qi to be stagnant and blocked in its course. Properly, it is beneficial to be high; do not go too low, and be early when appropriate; the advantage of earth lies in its qi transformation, and the people's qi also follow this.</p>
<p>Initially, earthly qi moves, cold departs, spring qi is established, winds come, and myriad things grow and flourish. People feel their qi relaxed, and wind and dampness are sparse; rain comes later. The people suffer from an excess of blood, tense muscles and tendons, and joints are not well-suited.</p>
<p>Second, when qi is great fire, things harmonize, and the people are at peace. Their diseases involve heat, expanse, and prevalence throughout near and far; dampness evaporates and rain comes in due time.</p>
<p>Third, heaven's politics arrange, damp qi descends, earthly qi rises, and rain falls in due time as cold accompanies it. When affected by cold and dampness, the people suffer from full bellies and swollen limbs.</p>
<p>Fourth, fearing fire approaching, dampness evaporates, earthly qi rises, heavenly qi is obscured, and there are cold winds at dawn and dusk. Dampness evaporates and forms white dew, thus establishing the autumn season. The people suffer from liver heat, blood boils over with fever, and the stomach and intestines are bloated and distended; in serious cases, they swell and become large.</p>
<p>Fifth, as the disaster has already occurred, there is cold dew and early frost, and leaves of grasses turn yellow. Cold qi pervades the body, and people suffer from skin and sinew diseases.</p>
<p>Finally, when cold and dampness accumulate, the water hardens into ice, and yang light cannot cure; affected by cold and dampness, qi flows together and causes illness, thus forming an epidemic. To prevent this, one must regulate the hazy qi and take advantage of its source, strengthen the seasonal qi, and do not let evil triumph; use grains to nourish true essence, and use leisure grains to preserve vitality. Therefore, in the year, one should regulate with bitter and dry warmth, especially so for those who have excess dampness; do not fail to excrete or disperse; if it does not disperse or excrete, then damp qi will overflow, flesh will decay, and skin will peel while blood and water interchange. One must encourage the Yang fire, protect against excessive cold, follow the qi's differences in abundance or scarcity, judge accordingly, and harmonize by following the same or opposite; for those who are the same, use heat to transform; for those who are damp, use dryness to transform; for opposites, use less of what is abundant and more of what is scarce, regulate with coolness from a distance, regulate with cold from afar, regulate with warmth from afar, and regulate with heat from afar. Misjudging this is disease; judging it correctly is health</p>

The subtle changes in yin and yang govern the operation of heaven, with the qi of heaven and earth being more pronounced at certain times. The grain is white, the politics are enlightened, and the harvest is bountiful. Cold and heat are balanced, and fire and water exist harmoniously, with the sun and moon shining brightly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diseases begin when cold and heat are in balance; diseases of the upper body occur when heat predominates, and diseases of the lower body occur when cold predominates. The people suffer from coughing and wheezing, red eyes with protruding whites and skin eruptions, while those with abdominal pain have dry throats, swollen tongues, and bloody noses.</p>
<p>As yang gradually increases, heat will begin to disappear, cold will start to manifest, and the qi will gradually retreat. Ice and frost will form, and wind will increase as yang becomes more concentrated. The people suffer from joint pain, stiffness in their limbs, and pain in their waist and lower back.</p>
<p>As yang reaches its peak, the first stage of summer heat begins, with diseases appearing both internally and externally. In the second stage, yang spreads throughout the body, and wind becomes more prevalent. Cold appears as winter approaches, and the people suffer from chills, red eyes, and conjunctivitis.</p>
<p>In the third stage, celestial politics prevail, and intense heat permeates all living beings, with lesser creatures flourishing. As cold becomes more pronounced, people experience heart and abdominal pain, as well as alternating feelings of cold and heat, coughing, red eyes, and skin eruptions.</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, damp heat is at its peak, bringing heavy rains, with cold and heat existing in balance. People suffer from cold and heat-related diseases, having dry throats, yellow complexions, and painful joints.</p>
<p>In the fifth stage, fear of fire increases, and summer becomes more intense, as yang transforms and all things flourish and grow. The people are healthy, but diseases with warm symptoms appear.</p>
<p>Finally, in the sixth stage, dryness dominates, excess heat accumulates within, leading to swelling in the upper body. If coughing persists, blood will flow, and cold will periodically surface, causing haze and fog, leading to skin diseases that originate from within and spread throughout the sides, affecting the lower abdomen and leading to disorders of the middle jiao.</p>
<p>To prevent these imbalances, one must regulate the qi, provide adequate nourishment for the season, control the excesses, use appropriate treatments based on the nature of the qi, and adjust dietary intake accordingly. By following this approach, one can maintain health and avoid disease.</p>

The policy of this era, managing heaven through the qi and yin, coincides with the proper seasons. Managing qi and yin in heaven leads to balanced celestial phenomena. The air is calm above, while the earth's air is harmonious below; winds rise in distant places, fires ignite, heat advances in the sun, clouds gather at the horizon, humidity follows its course, qi and fire unite, the upper stars correspond with the year's cycle. Their policy is swift; their order is efficient; their crops are a deep blue-green. Idle crops are said to be too white; their writings have decayed feathers and wings. Winds are dry, fires are hot, and they change in turn, pests arrive with the changing of the seasons, waters do not freeze, hot diseases run rampant below, wind diseases run rampant above, the two combine in the middle. The first qi is cold; it begins to act. Cold qi accumulates and approaches its peak; people suffer from cold at the right lower side. The second qi is cold and does not depart; hoarfrost and snow fall, cold qi transforms into frost, affecting the upper parts of plants, and cold rain falls, Yang rises, and people suffer from heat in the middle. The third qi is governed by heaven's politics; winds arise on time, and people cry out with dizziness and blindness. The fourth qi struggles between scorching humidity; as it advances to the left upper side, people suffer from jaundice and swelling. The fifth qi is dominated by dryness and humidity, sinking yin spreads below, cold qi pervades bodies, winds and rains run rampant. Finally, the qi of death arrives; Yang rises in great abundance, pests emerge, waters do not freeze, earth's air expands, plants grow, people relax, their diseases are mild and warm, but they must ward off the evil qi, nurture their source of vital energy, praise their running qi, and ensure that evil does not triumph. Seasonally, use aromatics to adjust above and salty flavors below; beware of fire's qi without causing disorder; use warmth, heat, coolness, and cold from afar; eat according to the same law</p>

<p>帝曰：善。夫子言可謂悉矣。然何以明其應乎。歧伯曰：昭乎哉問也。夫六氣者，行有次，止有位，故常以正月朔日平旦視之，覩其位而知其所在矣。運有餘，其至先，運不及，其至後，此天之道，氣之常也。運非有餘非不足，是謂正歲，其至當其時也。帝曰：勝復之氣，其常在也，災眚時至候也，柰何。歧伯曰：非氣化者，是謂災也。
Emperor said: Good. What you have said can be considered comprehensive. However, how can I understand the timing of it? Duke of Zhou said: It is about clarification. The six qi have an order in which they proceed and a position where they stop, so we always observe them on the day of the new moon and equinox, discerning their positions and knowing their locations. The presence or absence of excess or deficiency marks when it reaches its extreme, and if it fails to arrive at its due time, this is the way of heaven and the constant of the qi. If there is neither an excess nor a deficit, this is the proper season, and it should occur at the appropriate time. Emperor said: The qi of victory and defeat, what about its constant and its role as an omen? Duke of Zhou replied: That which does not change is called disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：天地之數終始柰何。歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也。是明道也。數之始，起於上而終於下，歲半之前，天氣主之，歲半之後，地氣主之，上下交互，氣交主之，歲紀畢矣。故曰位明氣月可知乎，所謂氣也。
The emperor asked: What is the number of heaven and earth? Duke Huan replied: It is indeed a question of comprehension. This is a matter of clear understanding. The number begins from above and ends below, halfway through the year, heaven governs the air, and halfway through the year after that, the earth governs the air; above and below exchange and control the air, and when the annual record is completed, it is called position, brightness, air, and knowing. This refers to air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：余司其事，則而行之，不合其數，何也。歧伯曰：氣用有多少，化洽有盛衰，衰盛多少，同其化也。帝曰：願聞同化何如。歧伯曰：風溫春化同，熱曛昏火夏化同，勝與復同，燥清煙露秋化同，雲雨昏暝埃長夏化同，寒氣霜雪冰冬化同，此天地五運六氣之化，更用盛衰之常也。帝曰：五運行同天化者，命曰天符，余知之矣。願聞同地化者，何謂也。歧伯曰：太過而同天化者三，不及而同天化者亦三，太過而同地化者三，不及而同地化者亦三，此凡二十四歲也。帝曰：願聞其所謂也。歧伯曰：甲辰甲戌太宮，下加太陰，壬寅壬申太角，下加厥陰，庚子庚午太商，下加陽明，如是者三。癸巳癸亥少徵，下加少陽，辛丑辛未少羽，下加太陽，癸卯癸酉少徵，下加少陰，如是者三。戊子戊午太徵，上臨少陰，戊寅戊申太徵，上臨少陽，丙辰丙戌太羽，上臨太陽，如是者三。丁巳丁亥少角，上臨厥陰，乙卯乙酉少商，上臨陽明，己丑己未少宮，上臨太陰，如是者三。除此二十四歲，則不加不臨也。帝曰：加者何謂。歧伯曰：太過而加同天符，不及而加同歲會也。帝曰：臨者何謂。歧伯曰：太過不及，皆曰天符，而變行有多少，病形有微甚，生死有早晏耳。
The Emperor said: I have attended to my affairs and acted accordingly, but they do not harmonize with the numbers. Duke of Zhou replied: The use of Qi is how much, the transformation of change is how abundant or diminished, abundance and diminishment are how similar in their transformations. The Emperor said: May I hear about the similarity in transformation? Duke of Zhou replied: When warmth is in harmony with spring's transformation, when heat and drowsiness are in harmony with summer's transformation, when victory and defeat are in harmony with autumn's transformation, when clarity, dryness, mist, and dew are in harmony with the transformation of long summer, when clouds and rain are in harmony with hazy autumn, when cold and frost are in harmony with winter's transformation, these are the transformations of the five phases of heaven and earth and the six Qi. This is also their constant cycle of abundance and diminishment. The Emperor said: In the transformations of the five phases that correspond to heaven's mark, I know this already. May I hear about the similarity in transformation for the land? Duke of Zhou replied: When it is too excessive, there are three transformations that correspond to heaven, and when it falls short, there are also three transformations that correspond to heaven. When it is too excessive or falls short, there are three transformations that correspond to the earth. These are what we call people at 24 years old. The Emperor said: May I hear of these? Duke of Zhou replied: In the case of those who have an excess of yang in their birth charts, add the excessive yin; in the case of those who have an excess of yin, add the insufficient yang. In the cases of those who have an excess of yang in their birth charts and are positioned next to insufficient yin, in the cases of those who have an excess of yin and are positioned next to insufficient yang, and in the cases of those who have an excess of yin and are positioned next to insufficient yang, these are three. In the cases of those who have a deficiency of yang in their birth charts and add the excessive yin; in the case of those who have a deficiency of yin and add the insufficient yang, in the case of those who have a deficiency of yin and are positioned next to insufficient yang, these are also three. The Emperor asked: What do add and be in mean? Duke of Zhou replied: When there is an excess that does not reach the proper level for heaven's mark, it is added as a sign of a year of birth. When there is a position that is neither too excessive nor too insufficient and is marked by changes in health and form, and life and death are early or delayed.</p>

<p>帝曰：夫子言用寒遠寒，用熱遠熱，余未知其然也，願聞何謂遠。歧伯曰：熱無犯熱，寒無犯寒，從者和，逆者病，不可不敬畏而遠之，所謂時興六位也。帝曰：溫涼何如。歧伯曰：司氣以熱，用熱無犯，司氣以寒，用寒無犯，司氣以涼，用涼無犯，司氣以溫，用溫無犯，閒氣同其主無犯，異其主則小犯之，是謂四畏，必謹察之。帝曰：善。其犯者何如。歧伯曰：天氣反時，則可依則，及勝其主則可犯，以平為期，而不可過，是謂邪氣反勝者。故曰：無失天信，無逆氣宜，無翼其勝，無贊其復，是謂至治。
Emperor said: Master Zhou said that hot makes one distant from heat, and cold makes one distant from cold. I do not know this to be true; I wish to hear what is meant by being distant. The Duke of Zhou said: Heat does not harm heat, cold does not harm cold, following them results in harmony, going against them results in illness, and it is not permissible to disrespect or fear them and keep a distance from them; this is called the six positions at the right time. Emperor said: How about moderate warmth and coolness? The Duke of Zhou said: Regulate the Qi with heat, do not harm heat, regulate the Qi with cold, do not harm cold, regulate the Qi with coolness, do not harm coolness, regulate the Qi with warmth, do not harm warmth, when there is no Qi, it does not harm its master without fault, if it goes against its master, it results in a small fault; this is called the four taboos, and it must be cautious. Emperor said: Good. What about the fault? The Duke of Zhou said: If the heavenly Qi reverses its proper timing, it can be adjusted accordingly; if it wins over its master, it can cause harm, establishing equilibrium as a goal but not exceeding it; this is called reversed Qi winning. Therefore, he says: There are no failures in following heaven's will, there is no going against the Qi's proper direction, there is no boasting in its victory, and there is no praising its recovery; this is called supreme governance.</p>

Emperor asked: How is this Qi like? 
Qi of muddy water: violent shaking of mountains, thunder and lightning intermingling, dust, turning yellow and black, changing into white gas, drifting and exploding high up, striking rocks and flying in the air, floods suddenly rising and rivers spreading out, pastures, fields, and grazing lands. The Qi is there from its four energies. Gas stretching across the sky, floating and arising, portends disaster ahead. 
Qi of pure water: clear heaven and earth, wind blowing, air fresh and crisp, great cold suddenly coming, grasses and trees wilting smoke, drought driving winds, mists rising up in numbers, killing the Qi as it approaches, grasses and trees parched and golden. 
The Qi that is portended here has the energy of five. At night, a light dew, this being a sign ahead. Water Qi: Yang Qi separating, Yin Qi arising strongly, great cold coming, rivers freezing into frost and snow, extreme cold leading to ice, sometimes becoming yellow and black, flowing winds interweaving, which leads to frost killing, water seeing auspiciousness. 
People's illnesses are characterized by cold guests, heart pain, lower back pain, the joints not being comfortable, bending and stretching not feeling good, with diarrhea appearing as a sign ahead. Yang light not treating, dark yin accumulating, white dust becoming dull, which is the Qi coming ahead, its energy two fires. Deeply hidden, mysterious, gas still seems to be scattered, dark with a hint of yellow, this being a sign ahead. 
Wood Qi: deeply hidden, pale and dull, clouds stirring up the things of wood, great wind suddenly arriving, causing houses to collapse and breaking trees. People's illnesses are characterized by stomach pain at the junction of the heart and diaphragm, support on both sides, the throat not being able to swallow, food and drink not going down, extreme cases leading to ringing in the ears and dizziness, not recognizing people. Too pale wood Qi, all of heaven looking the same color, sometimes with gas pollution becoming yellow and black, hazy mud clouds not producing rain but suddenly coming ahead, its energy is without constancy. 
Long rivers, grasses lying down, soft leaves showing yin, pines singing high mountains, being a sign ahead. Fire Qi: deeply hidden, swelling and bloated, great clarity not shining, flames of fire running, great heat arriving, mountains and streams burning, trees and wood becoming soggy, broad spaces leaping smoke, earth floating in frost and salt, stilling the water, withered vines and grasses becoming yellow, winds carrying confused speech, dampness turning into fog, which follows behind. 
People's illnesses are characterized by deficient Qi, buboes, pustules, swelling of the flanks, ribs, face, four limbs, internal organs distending with pain, blood flowing and overflowing, seminal fluid coming short, eyes red and heart hot, extreme cases leading to stupefaction and regret, sometimes leading to sudden death. Great heat coming, sweating profusely, this being the Qi suddenly coming ahead, its energy is four. Moving again, then still, Yang extreme becoming Yin, dampness allowing Qi to be transformed and succeeding. 
Water freezing into ice, mountains and rivers icing over and flames of Yang at midday, being a sign ahead. There is a response to the signs ahead, and afterwards there is repayment. All are observed in their extremes, being the cause of the sudden coming of the Qi, wood has no time, water follows fire. Be cautious of its time, illness can be predicted, missing the time leads to aging, the five energies not moving, Qi gathering and storing, governance is without stability</p>

<p>帝曰：水發而雹雪，土發而飄驟，木發而毀折，金發而清明，火發而曛昧，何氣使然。歧伯曰：氣有多少，發有微甚，微者當其氣，甚者兼其下，徵其下氣而見可知也。
The Emperor said: When water is released, it becomes hail and snow; when earth is released, it becomes gusts and shocks; when wood is released, it becomes rotten and bent; when metal is released, it becomes clear and bright; when fire is released, it becomes vast and immeasurable. What power causes this? Duke Mu said: There are varying amounts of energy and the extent to which they are released can be subtle or significant. Those that are subtle should follow their energy, and those that are significant should also follow their subordinate energies, thereby one can perceive their energies.</p>

<li>
<p>帝曰：善。五氣之發，不當位者何也。歧伯曰：命其差。帝曰：差有數乎。歧伯曰：後皆三十度而有奇也。帝曰：氣至而先後者何。歧伯曰：運太過則其至先，運不及則其至後，此候之常也。帝曰：當時而至者何也。歧伯曰：非太過，非不及，則至當時，非是者眚也。帝曰：善。氣有非時而化者何也。歧伯曰：太過者，當其時，不及者，歸其己勝也。帝曰：四時之氣，至有早晏高下左右，其候何如。歧伯曰：行有逆順，至有遲速，故太過者化先天，不及者化後天。帝曰：願聞其行，何謂也。歧伯曰：春氣西行，夏氣北行，秋氣東行，冬氣南行。故春氣始於下，秋氣始於上，夏氣始於中，冬氣始於標，春氣始於左，秋氣始於右，冬氣始於後，夏氣始於前，此四時正化之常。故至高之地，冬氣常在，至下之地，春氣常在，必謹察之。帝曰：善。
Emperor said: Good. When the five energies are emitted, what does it mean when they are not in position? Duke of Zhou said: Order him to attend. Emperor said: Does attending have a number? Duke of Zhou said: Following always has thirty degrees and is irregular. Emperor said: What is it like when the energy reaches its height first? Duke of Zhou said: If the luck is too excessive, it will arrive first; if the luck is insufficient, it will arrive later. This is the usual pattern. Emperor said: Good. What is it like when the energy transforms at a time other than its proper time? Duke of Zhou said: If it is too excessive, it will transform at that time; if it is insufficient, it will not transform until later. It is rare for such a thing to happen. Emperor said: Good. What causes the five energies to transform in different ways at the four seasons? Duke of Zhou said: They have advancement and recession, coming early or late, so too much leads them to transform first, and insufficient leads them to transform later. Emperor said: I wish to hear about their progression, what do you mean by that? Duke of Zhou said: In spring, the energy moves westward; in summer, it moves northward; in autumn, it moves eastward; in winter, it moves southward. Thus, the energy of spring starts from below, that of autumn starts from above, that of summer starts from the center, and that of winter starts from the peak, the energy of spring starts from the left, that of autumn starts from the right, that of winter starts from behind, and that of summer starts from in front. This is the constant pattern of the four seasons' transformation. Therefore, at high places, winter energy is always present, and at low places, spring energy is always present. One must pay close attention to this. Emperor said: Good.</p>

<p>黃帝問曰：五運六氣之應見六化之正，六變之紀，何如。歧伯對曰：夫六氣正紀，有化有變，有勝有復，有用有病，不同其候，帝欲何乎。帝曰：願盡聞之。歧伯曰：請遂言之。夫氣之所至也，厥陰所至為和平，少陰所至為暄，太陰所至為埃溽，少陽所至為炎暑，陽明所至為清勁，太陽所至為寒雰，時化之常也。
Yellow Emperor asked, Regarding the correspondence between the five phases and six Qi, and the records of the changes of the six Qi, how does it manifest? Duke of Zhou replied, The records of the six Qi have both transformation and change, victory and recovery, and use and illness. What do you wish to know about them, Emperor? The Emperor said, I wish to hear everything about it. Duke of Zhou said, Please proceed with the explanation. When the Qi reaches its destination, Excessive Yin reaching harmony and peace, Lesser Yin reaching scorching heat, Greater Yin reaching drizzling rain, Lesser Yang reaching intense heat, Direct Yang reaching clear energy, and Great Yang reaching cold mist – this is the constant transformation.</p>

<p>厥陰所至為風府，為璺啟。少陰所至為火府，為舒榮。太陰所至為雨府，為員盈。少陽所至為熱府，為行出。陽明所至為司殺府，為庚蒼。太陽所至為寒府，為歸藏。司化之常也。
The Depletion Palace is the Wind Bureau, and the Refining Beginning. The Deficient Yin's location is the Fire Bureau, and the Soothing Glory. The Excess Yin's location is the Rain Bureau, and the Complete Abundance. The Excess Yang's location is the Heat Bureau, and the Pervading Emergence. The Clear Brightness' location is the Execution Bureau, and the Metal-Azure. The Great Sun's location is the Cold Bureau, and the Returning Storage. This is the constant of regulating [the body].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>厥陰所至為生，為風搖。少陰所至為榮，為形見。太陰所至為化，為雲雨。少陽所至為長，為蕃鮮。陽明所至為收，為霧露。太陽所至為藏，為周密。氣化之常也。
When Yin reaches its limit, there is creation and movement. When Shao Yin reaches its limit, there is fame and form. When Tai Yin reaches its limit, there is transformation and the coming of clouds and rain. When Shao Yang reaches its limit, there is growth and fragrance. When Yang Ming reaches its limit, there is gathering and dew. When Tai Yang reaches its limit, there is concealment and deep secrecy. This is the constant way of Qi transformation.</p>

When Yin is reached, the wind arises and becomes tranquil. When Shao Yin is reached, heat arises and becomes cold. When Tai Yin is reached, dampness arises and becomes regulated rain. When Shao Yang is reached, fire arises and becomes evaporation. When Yang Ming is reached, desiccation arises and becomes coolness. When Tai Yang is reached, cold arises and becomes warmth. This is the constant principle of transformation. When Yin is reached, it transforms into hair; when Shao Yin is reached, it transforms into feathers; when Tai Yin is reached, it transforms into pustules; when Shao Yang is reached, it transforms into feathers; when Yang Ming is reached, it transforms into intermediate states; when Tai Yang is reached, it transforms into scales. This is the constant principle of transformation.</p>

<li>
<p>厥陰所至為生化，少陰所至為榮化，太陰所至為濡化，少陽所至為茂化，陽明所至為堅化，太陽所至為藏化，布政之常也。
The principles of life, reputation, moisture, luxuriance, solidity, concealment, and governance are established by the various yin and yang energies.
The text is a quote from the Book of Changes (I Ching), specifically chapter 1 The Creative or The Beginning. It describes the different manifestations of yin and yang energy that govern various aspects of life, nature, and human experience</p>

The Yin arrives at being vacillating and furious, cold and chilly; the Shao Yin arrives at being vast and icy, thundering and fierce lightning with sudden gusts of wind; the Tai Yin arrives at being scattered and dispersing warmth, the Yang Ming arrives at being scattered and falling, warm temperatures; the Tai Yang arrives at being cold, snowy, hailstones and white ash, changes in the Qi are constant.</p>

The arrival at the left side causes agitation, and accompanies following. The arrival at the right side is bright, and accompanies scattering. The arrival at the yin side is deep and obscure, and accompanies white ash and darkness. The arrival at the yang side is illuminating and clear, and accompanies shining clouds and scattering. The arrival at the light yang side is luminous, clear, and accompanies hail and the sound of ringing. The great sun's arrival is firm and strong, establishing a steady course as it goes.</p>

When yin reaches the interior, it becomes urgent; when yang reaches the interior, it becomes fever. When yin reaches the repletion and depletion, there is a check in the gate of transformation. When yang reaches the bending and stretching, it is not beneficial. This is the normal course of disease. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When yin reaches the support, there is pain; when yang reaches the shock and fright, there are chills and trembling madness. When yin reaches accumulation, there is fullness; when yang reaches surprise agitation and bad taste, there is violent illness. When yin reaches the anus and genitals of the left and right, there is foot pain and limb disease. When yang reaches the back pain, this is the normal course of disease.</p>
<p>When yin reaches tightness, there is irritation; when yang reaches whimsicality and sorrow, there are swellings and knots. When yin reaches confusion, there is disordered vomiting downward. When yang reaches throat hoarseness and ringing in the ears, there is vomiting gushing up. When yin opens and spreads wide, and yang reaches sweating and cramps, this is the normal course of disease.</p>
<p>When yin reaches the flanks and secretions, there is pain and discharge; when yang reaches speech and laughter, there is fullness in the abdomen and buttocks. When yin reaches repletion and heaviness, there is extreme registering and spasms leading to death. When yin reaches the wheezing and coughing, and yang reaches leakage and restraint, this is the normal course of disease.</p>

<p>凡此十二變者，報德以德，報化以化，報政以政，報令以令，氣高則高，氣下則下，氣後則後，氣前則前，氣中則中，氣外則外，位之常也。故風勝則動，熱勝則腫，燥勝則乾，寒勝則浮，濕勝則濡泄，甚則水閉胕腫，隨氣所在以言其變耳。
The twelve transformations here have consequences that match their nature, like corresponds to like, governance corresponds to governance, rules correspond to rules. The spirit high is high, the spirit low is low, the spirit in back is in back, the spirit in front is in front, the spirit in the middle is in the middle, the spirit outside is outside, this is the constant positioning of the spirit. Thus when wind dominates, there is movement; when heat dominates, there is swelling; when aridity dominates, it becomes dry; when cold dominates, it floats; when dampness dominates, it becomes wet and leaks; when excessive, water stops up and swells; following the spirit's location, one can speak of its transformation.</p>

<p>帝曰：願聞其用也。歧伯曰：夫六氣之用各歸不勝而為化。故太陰雨化，施於太陽，太陽寒化，施於少陰，少陰熱化，施於陽明，陽明燥化，施於厥陰，厥陰風化，施於太陰，各命其所在以徵之也。帝曰：自得其位何如。歧伯曰：自得其位，常化也。帝曰：願聞所在也。歧伯曰：命其位而方，月可知也。帝曰：六位之氣盈虛何如。歧伯曰：太少異也，太者之至徐而常，少者暴而亡。帝曰：天地之氣，盈虛何如。歧伯曰：天氣不足，地氣隨之，地氣不足，天氣從之，運居其中而常先也。惡所不勝，歸所同和，隨運歸從而生其病也。故上勝則天氣降而下，下勝則地氣遷而上，多少而差其分，微者小差，甚者大差，甚則位易氣交易，則大變生而病作矣。大要曰：甚紀五分，微紀七分，其差可見，此之謂也。
Emperor said: I wish to hear about its uses. Huan Gé said: Regarding the six Qi, each has its own use and limit before being transformed. Therefore, the Taiyin (Lung) transforms water, is applied to Taiyang (Large Intestine), Taiyang becomes cold, is applied to Shaoyang (Liver &amp; Gallbladder), Shaoyang becomes hot, is applied to Yangming (Stomach), Yangming becomes dry, is applied to Jueyin (Kidney), Jueyin transforms wind, and is applied to Taiyin again, each serving its location and indicating it. Emperor said: How does it naturally settle? Huan Gé said: When it naturally settles, it transforms. Emperor said: I wish to hear about its location. Huan Gé said: Assign a position and it will be there, but the Moon can only know it. Emperor said: What is the difference between excess and deficiency of the six positions? Huan Gé said: The excess of Tai and the deficiency of Shaos are different. The Tai is constantly moderate and gradually, while the Shaos are abrupt and perishable. Emperor said: How is the Qi of Heaven and Earth excess and deficiency? Huan Gé said: If there is insufficient Qi in Heaven, the Earth Qi follows it. If there is insufficient Qi on Earth, Heaven Qi comes after it. They dwell together in the middle, but if one predominates, disease will arise. Therefore, if superior wins, the Qi of Heaven will descend, and if inferior wins, the Qi of Earth will shift upward, with some more and some less, large differences in divisions. Small ones are small differences, and large ones are great differences, and when there is a great difference, positions become unstable, and Qi exchanges occur, leading to significant changes and disease arises. The Great Learning says: Observe the small differences of seven divisions, and observe the large differences of five divisions; their differences can be seen, and this is what it means.</p>

<p>帝曰：善。論言熱無犯熱，寒無犯寒，余欲不遠寒，不遠熱，柰何。歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也。發表不遠熱，攻裏不遠寒。帝曰：不發不攻而犯寒犯熱，何如。歧伯曰：寒熱內賊，其病益甚。帝曰：願聞無病者何如。歧伯曰：無者生之，有者甚之。帝曰：生者何如。歧伯曰：不遠熱則熱至，不遠寒則寒至。寒至，則堅否腹滿，痛急下利之病生矣。熱至，則身熱吐下霍亂，癰疽瘡瘍，瞀鬱注下，瞤瘛腫脹，嘔，鼽衂頭痛，骨節變，肉痛血溢血泄，淋閟之病生矣。帝曰：治之柰何。歧伯曰：時必順之，犯者治以勝也。黃帝問曰：婦人重身，毒之何如。歧伯曰：有故無殞，亦無殞也。帝曰：願聞其故何謂也。歧伯曰：大積大聚，其可犯也，衰其太半而止，過者死。帝曰：善。鬱之甚者治之柰何。歧伯曰：木鬱達之，火鬱發之，土鬱奪之，金鬱泄之，水鬱折之，然調其氣，過者折之，以其畏也，所謂寫之。帝曰：假者何如。歧伯曰：有假其氣，則無禁也。所謂主氣不足客氣勝也。帝曰：至哉聖人之道，天地大化運行之節，臨御之紀，陰陽之政，寒暑之今，非夫子孰能通之，請藏之靈蘭之室，署曰六元正紀，非齋戒不敢示，慎傳也。
Emperor: Well done. Confucius said that one should not overheat without causing heat, nor overcool without causing cold, but how can this be? Zengzi said, Indeed, I understand the question. Propose a state of not overheating and not overcooling. Emperor: If one does not propose and does not attack, causing both heat and cold, what is that like? Zengzi said: Heat and cold are internal adversaries; their illness becomes more severe. Emperor: May I hear how one without illness is like? Zengzi said: That which produces life is without illness, but that which produces sickness is excessive. Emperor: What is it like to produce life? Zengzi said: Not overheating leads to heat exhaustion, and not overcooling leads to cold exhaustion. When cold reaches its extreme, the abdomen becomes stiff and bloated, causing pain and urgent diarrhea; when heat reaches its extreme, the body has fever, chills, rashes, boils, carbuncles, joint pain, muscle pain with bleeding and leakage, and various diseases arise. Emperor: How should it be treated? Zengzi said: One must follow what is appropriate, treating what has invaded as defeat. Emperor asked about the toxicity of a woman's reproductive system: Zengzi said: There are those who suffer due to the uterus and those who do not. Emperor asked about the cause of the latter: Zengzi said: It accumulates and gathers, which is something to be wary of; if it weakens the kidneys, it will stop, but if it exceeds that, one will die. Emperor: Well done. How should one treat severe toxicity? Zengzi said: Wood treats toxicity, fire sends it out, earth takes it away, metal releases it, water breaks it, but regulating the qi, cutting off what is excessive by its fear, is called cauterization. Emperor: If there is none of this, what is it like? Zengzi said: Regulating qi and not allowing external influences to win out is like a ruler. The emperor said: How marvelous! The way of the sage is the regulation of heaven and earth's transformations, the rituals of governance, the principles of yin and yang, heat and cold, which even the greatest master cannot fully understand; I beg to preserve it in the Spiritual Hall and call it the Six Regularities. No one dares to reveal this. Be cautious in transmitting it.</p>
