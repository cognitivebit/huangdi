<h1 id="_1">瘧論</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：夫痎瘧皆生於風，其蓄作有時者，何也。歧伯對曰：瘧之始發也，先起於毫毛，伸欠乃作，寒慄鼓頷，腰脊俱痛，寒去則內外皆熱，頭痛如破，渴欲冷飲。帝曰：何氣使然，願聞其道。歧伯曰：陰陽上下交爭，虛實更作，陰陽相移也。陽并於陰，則陰實而陽虛，陽明虛，則寒慄鼓頷也；巨陽虛，則腰背頭項痛；三陽俱虛，則陰氣勝，陰氣勝，則骨寒而痛；寒生於內，故中外皆寒；陽盛則外熱；陰虛則內熱，外內皆熱，則喘而渴；故欲冷飲也。此皆得之夏傷於暑，熱氣盛，藏於皮膚之內，腸胃之外，此榮氣之所舍也。此令人汗空踈，腠理開，因得秋氣，汗出遇風，及得之以浴，水氣舍於皮膚之內，與衛氣并居。衛氣者，晝日行於陽，夜行於陰，此氣得陽而外出，得陰而內薄，內外相薄，是以日作。
Emperor Ask: Now, with regard to measles, it is generated by wind, and when the right time comes for it to manifest, what is this? Hua-Bo replied: Measles begins from an initial outbreak, starting from the hair follicle. It spreads or shrinks depending on the situation, one feels cold all over, the back and waist hurt, and once the cold leaves, both inside and out become hot, headaches feel like they are cracking open, and one thirsts for cold drinks. Emperor Ask: What Qi causes this? I wish to hear of its pathway. Hua-Bo said: The Yin and Yang are in conflict above and below, creating emptiness and reality, causing the Yin and Yang to move. When Yang is dominant over Yin, there is real Yin and empty Yang, and when Yang is empty, this leads to chills and trembling. If Great Yang is empty, it causes pain in the back, neck, head, and shoulders; if all three Yang are empty, then Yin Qi prevails, and since Yin Qi prevails, the bones feel cold and painful; when heat is internalized, this leads to both inside and out being hot, causing shortness of breath and thirst; thus desiring cool drinks. All of these are acquired summer damages from heat, with excess heat trapped within the skin's depths, beyond the intestines and stomach, this is where the dispersed Qi resides. This makes one sweat profusely, perspiration glands open, allowing for autumn Qi to enter, sweating encounters wind, and by bathing with water, the Water Qi settles within the skin's depths, alongside the Defensive Qi. The Defensive Qi travels throughout the day in Yang and at night in Yin, this Qi receives Yang and exits outward, receives Yin and resides within, causing internal and external to be weak, thus it occurs daily</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：其間日而作者何也。歧伯曰：其氣之舍深，內薄於陰，陽氣獨發，陰邪內著，陰與陽爭不得出，是以間日而作也。帝曰：善。其作日晏與其日早者，何氣使然。歧伯曰：邪氣客於風府，循膂而下，衛氣一日一夜大會於風府，其明日日下一節，故其作也晏，此先客於脊背也，每至於風府則腠理開，腠理開則邪氣入，邪氣入則病作，以此日作稍益晏也。其出於風府，日下一節，二十五日下至骶骨，二十六日入於脊內，注於伏膂之脈，其氣上行，九日出於缺盆之中，其氣日高，故作日益早也。其間日發者，由邪氣內薄於五藏，橫連募原也，其道遠，其氣深，其行遲，不能與衛氣俱行，不得皆出，故間日乃作也。
Emperor said: Who is the one that makes it day by day? Hui Bo said: Its Qi is released deeply, its Yin is thin inside, Yang-Qi is emitted alone, Yin evil is retained inside, Yin and Yang compete not being able to come out, thus making it day by day. Emperor said: Good. What Qi makes the day wane when it becomes day? Hui Bo said: Evil Qi resides in the lungs, circulating downwards, defensive Qi gathers daily and nightly in the lungs, on the following day it goes down a node, thus making it dayless. This evil residing at the spine, every time arriving at the lungs the network will open, the network opens then evil Qi enters, evil Qi entering then disease arises, and this daylessness makes it more waning. When it comes out of the lungs, going down a node on the following day, 25 nodes down to the vertebrae, 26 nodes entering the spine, connecting at the hiding tendon's meridian, its Qi rises upwards, 9 days later coming out from the huiyin, its Qi is high and makes it day more early. When there is an interval day, it is due to evil Qi being thin in the five organs, connecting the source origin. Its way is distant, its Qi is deep, its movement is slow, not able to join with defensive Qi, not being able to all come out, thus making an interval day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：夫子言衛氣每至於風府，腠理乃發，發則邪氣入，入則病作。今衛氣日下一節，其氣之發也不當風府，其日作者柰何。歧伯曰：此邪氣客於頭項循膂而下者也，故虛實不同，邪中異所，則不得當其風府也。故邪中於頭項者，氣至頭項而病；中於背者，氣至背而病；中於腰脊者，氣至腰脊而病；中於手足者，氣至手足而病。衛氣之所在，與邪氣相合，則病作。故風無常府，衛氣之所發，必開其腠理，邪氣之所合，則其府也。帝曰：善。
The Emperor said: Confucius said that guardian Qi is always at the doors of the Temple of Winds, and when it sends out its breath, evil Qi enters. If evil Qi enters, then one will fall ill. Now guardian Qi is sinking one step each day. How could this be? Duke Mu replied: This evil Qi resides in the head and neck, circulates through the tendons, and descends. Hence its manifestations are different, and it cannot be approached at its residence. Therefore, when evil Qi resides in the head and neck, guardian Qi accumulates at the head and one falls ill; when it resides in the back, guardian Qi accumulates at the back and one falls ill; when it resides in the waist and spine, guardian Qi accumulates at the waist and spine and one falls ill; when it resides in the hands and feet, guardian Qi accumulates at the hands and feet and one falls ill. When guardian Qi and evil Qi converge, then one falls ill. Therefore, the Temple of Winds has no constant abode, as guardian Qi's place of emission must open its orifices, and the place where evil Qi resides is its residence. The Emperor said: Excellent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>夫風之與瘧也，相似同類，而風獨常在，瘧得有時而休者何也。歧伯曰：風氣留其處，故常在；瘧氣隨經絡沈以內薄，故衛氣應乃作。帝曰：瘧先寒而後熱者，何也。歧伯曰：夏傷於大暑，其汗大出，腠理開發，因遇夏氣淒滄之水寒，藏於腠理皮膚之中，秋傷於風，則病成矣。夫寒者，陰氣也，風者，陽氣也，先傷於寒，而後傷於風，故先寒而後熱也，病以時作，名曰寒瘧。帝曰：先熱而後寒者，何也。歧伯曰：此先傷於風而後傷於寒，故先熱而後寒也，亦以時作，名曰溫瘧。其但熱而不寒者，陰氣先絕，陽氣獨發，則少氣煩冤，手足熱而欲嘔，名曰癉瘧。
Regarding the relationship between wind and measles, they are similar in nature, yet wind is always present while measles sometimes subside. Master Qi said: Wind energy stays in its place, which is why it is always present; measles energy enters the meridians and channels and then sinks internally, which is why defensive energy is mobilized. The Emperor asked: Why do measles first start with cold and then become hot? Master Qi replied: In summer, one gets injured from intense heat, causing excessive sweating and the pores opening widely; encountering the dry and cold summer energy in the body's water, it becomes trapped within the pores and skin. In autumn, one gets injured by wind, so the illness is complete. The cold is yin energy, and wind is yang energy; being injured first by cold and then by wind, this is why it starts as cold and then becomes hot. The Emperor asked: What about when it first becomes hot and then cold? Master Qi replied: This is being injured first by wind and then by cold, which is why it first becomes hot and then cold; it arises at its own time, and is called warm measles. When there is only heat but no cold, yin energy is deficient and yang energy emerges, causing restlessness and irritability, with the hands and feet becoming hot and feeling like vomiting; this is called acute measles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：夫經言有餘者寫之，不足者補之。今熱為有餘，寒為不足。夫瘧者之寒，湯火不能溫也，及其熱，冰水不能寒也，此皆有餘不足之類。當此之時，良工不能止，必須其自衰，乃刺之，其故何也，願聞其說。歧伯曰；經言無刺熇熇之熱，無刺渾渾之脈，無刺漉漉之汗，故為其病逆未可治也。夫瘧之始發也，陽氣并於陰，當是之時，陽虛而陰盛，外無氣，故先寒慄也。陰氣逆極，則復出之陽，陽與陰復并於外，則陰虛而陽實，故先熱而渴。夫瘧氣者，并於陽則陽勝，并於陰則陰勝，陰勝則寒，陽勝則熱。瘧者，風寒之氣不常也，病極則復。至病之發也，如火之熱，如風雨不可當也。故經言曰：方其盛時必毀，因其衰也，事必大昌。此之謂也。夫瘧之未發也，陰未并陽，陽未并陰，因而調之，真氣得安，邪氣乃亡，故工不能治其已發，為其氣逆也。帝曰：善。攻之柰何，早晏何如。歧伯曰：瘧之且發也，陰陽之且移也，必從四末始也，陽已傷，陰從之，故先其時堅束其處，令邪氣不得入，陰氣不得出，審候見之在孫絡盛堅而血者皆取之，此真往而未得并者也。帝曰：瘧不發，其應何如。歧伯曰：瘧氣者，必更盛更虛，當氣之所在也，病在陽，則熱而脈躁；在陰，則寒而脈靜；極則陰陽俱衰，衛氣相離，故病得休；衛氣集，則復病也。
The Emperor asked: A disease that has too much heat and not enough cold is called 'feng.' Boiling water cannot warm it, and ice water cannot cool it; both have an excess and a deficiency. At such a time, an expert physician cannot treat it but must let it decline. Why so? I would like to hear the explanation. Qi Bo said: A classic text does not prescribe acupuncture for excessive heat, does not prescribe acupuncture for abundant blood vessels, and does not prescribe acupuncture for perspiration. Therefore, a disease is incurable when it reaches this stage. The classic text says, 'At the height of its course, one must destroy it; in decline, one must aid it, and there will be great success.' </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Feng, he continued, begins with an imbalance between yang and yin energies. When that occurs, yang is depleted while yin is excessive, resulting in a lack of external energy and thus the initial stage presents with cold symptoms. When yin energy becomes excessively dominant, it will cause yang to resurface, and both yin and yang become unbalanced externally; this leads to an initial state of heat and thirst. </p>
<p>In feng disease, he explained, when yang or yin energies predominate, the result is either cold or heat. When the yin energy prevails, there are cold symptoms; when the yang energy prevails, there are heat symptoms. Feng, or wind-cold energy, is not constant and extremes of disease can resolve. </p>
<p>By the time the illness has fully manifested, he said, it is like a fire that is intense or a storm that cannot be withstood. Therefore, the classic text states: 'When its full force appears, it will collapse; when it declines, one must aid it, and there will be great success.' This is what I mean. </p>
<p>If feng has not yet fully manifested, he said, and yin and yang energies have not become unbalanced, regulate them. When true energy is at peace, evil energy will vanish, and the physician cannot treat an already-manifested illness because the energy is out of balance. </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How should one intervene in the early stages of feng and what about late stages? Qi Bo said: In the early stages of feng, yin and yang energies have not yet become unbalanced, but if left untreated, they will become imbalanced. Beginning at the four extremities, first strengthen yang energy so it can protect against the invasion of evil energy; do not let yin energy overflow and do not let yang energy escape. Observe carefully and take blood samples from those who are sinewy and strong. This is a preparatory stage that has not yet reached harmony. </p>
<p>If feng has not yet manifested, he said, its energies will fluctuate between excess and deficiency. If the disease is located in the yang energy, there will be heat and blood vessels will be agitated; if it is located in the yin energy, there will be cold symptoms and blood vessels will be quiet. Extremes of either can cause both yin and yang energies to decline, separating defensive Qi energies and leading to illness. When defensive Qi gathers, the disease may return.</p>

<li>
<p>帝曰：時有間二日或至數日發，或渴或不渴，其故何也。歧伯曰：其間日者，邪氣與衛氣客於六府，而有時相失，不能相得，故休數日乃作也。瘧者，陰陽更勝也，或甚或不甚，故或渴或不渴。帝曰：論言夏傷於暑，秋必病瘧，今瘧不必應者何也。歧伯曰：此應四時者也。其病異形者，反四時也。其以秋病者寒甚，以冬病者寒不甚，以春病者惡風，以夏病者多汗。
The emperor asked: In some cases, there may be an interval of two or several days, and one may feel thirsty or not feel thirsty. What is the reason for this? Duke Huan responded: During that period, the pathogenic qi and the defensive qi are in conflict at the six departments, and sometimes they cannot find each other, resulting in rest. This occurs because yin and yang may be predominant to varying degrees, leading one to feel thirsty or not feel thirsty. The emperor asked: Discussing the topic of summer ailments caused by heat, if someone falls ill with fever in the autumn, why is it not necessarily applicable today? Duke Huan responded: This applies to seasonal diseases. Someone's illness manifesting abnormally is due to the reversal of the seasons. In cases where one becomes ill in autumn, they are particularly cold; in cases where one becomes ill in winter, they are not excessively cold; in cases where one becomes ill in spring, there is excessive wind; and in cases where one becomes ill in summer, there is excessive sweating.</p>

<p>帝曰：夫病溫瘧與寒瘧而皆安舍，舍於何藏。歧伯曰：溫瘧者，得之冬中於風，寒氣藏於骨髓之中，至春則陽氣大發，邪氣不能自出，因遇大暑，腦髓爍，肌肉消，腠理發泄，或有所用力，邪氣與汗皆出，此病藏於腎，其氣先從內出之於外也。如是者，陰虛而陽盛，陽盛則熱矣，衰則氣復反入，入則陽虛，陽虛則寒矣，故先熱而後寒，名曰溫瘧。帝曰：癉瘧何如。歧伯曰：癉瘧者，肺素有熱氣盛於身，厥逆上衝，中氣實而不外泄，因有所用力，腠理開，風寒舍於皮膚之內、分肉之閒而發，發則陽氣盛，陽氣盛而不衰，則病矣。其氣不及於陰，故但熱而不寒，氣內藏於心，而外舍於分肉之閒，令人消爍脫肉，故命曰癉瘧。帝曰：善。
Emperor said: Both fever with heat and cold are secure, where is the shelter? Duke of Shou said: The one with heat, obtained in winter from wind, the qi is hidden in the bone marrow during spring when the Yang qi expands greatly, the pathogenic qi cannot be released by itself, encountering great summer heat, the brain and marrow dry up, muscles dissolve, tendons leak fluids, and there may be some force used. The pathogenic qi and sweat all come out, this illness is sheltered in the kidney, and its qi first comes out from within to go outside. If so, yin is deficient and yang is abundant, yang being abundant leads to heat, and when it weakens, the qi returns, and yin becomes deficient, leading to cold, hence it is called heat evil.</p>

<p>Emperor asked: What about febrile disease? Duke of Shou said: Febrile disease, the lungs have a hot qi in the body, the excess overturns, and the qi is full in the center but not released outside, causing some force to be used. Tendons open, wind and cold hide within the skin and subcutaneous tissue while manifesting, when Yang qi is abundant, and Yang being abundant does not weaken, then there is illness. Its qi does not reach yin, hence only heat but no cold, its qi is sheltered in the heart, and released outside in the subcutaneous tissue, causing the person to waste away, dry up, and shed skin, hence it is called febrile disease. Emperor said: Good.</p>
