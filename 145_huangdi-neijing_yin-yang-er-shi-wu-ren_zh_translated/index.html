<h1 id="_1">陰陽二十五人</h1>
<ol>
<li>黃帝曰：余聞陰陽之人何如？伯高曰：天地之間，六合之內，不離於五，人亦應之。故五五二十五人之政，而陰陽之人不與焉。其態又不合於眾者五，余已知之矣。願聞二十五人之形，血氣之所生，別而以候，從外知內，何如？歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也，此先師之秘也，雖伯高猶不能明之也。黃帝避席遵循而卻曰：余聞之得其人弗教，是謂重失，得而泄之，天將厭之，余願得而明之，金櫃藏之，不敢揚之。歧伯曰：先立五形金木水火土，別其五色，異其五形之人，而二十五人具矣。黃帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯曰：慎之慎之，臣請言之。
Yellow Emperor said: What of those skilled in Yin and Yang? Bo Gao replied: Within the interval between Heaven and Earth, within the Six Cycles, there is no place without the Five. Man should also follow this pattern. Thus, among the Twenty-Five Hegemons, there are those skilled in Yin and Yang who are not part of it; their conduct does not conform to that of the Five. I already know this. I would like to hear about the form of the Twenty-Five Hegemons, the place where blood and qi are generated, separating them as omens and knowing the inside from the outside. How is this done?</li>
</ol>
<p>Huangdi (Yellow Emperor) avoided the seat and followed along while saying: I have heard that those who possess this person do not teach it, which is a great loss. Obtaining it and then disclosing it, the Heavens will be weary of it. I wish to understand it and keep it hidden in my heart, not daring to reveal it.</p>
<p>Huangdi (Yellow Emperor) said: Please allow me to hear about this one more time. Huangdi (Yellow Emperor) replied: Please proceed with caution. My lord, may I dare speak of it?</p>
<p>First establish the Five Forms of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth, distinguish their five colors, and differentiate the forms of the people among the Twenty-Five Hegemons, and they will be complete. Yellow Emperor said: Please allow me to hear this one more time. Huangdi (Yellow Emperor) replied: Proceed with great care. My lord, may I dare speak about it?</p>

People shaped like water are compared to Yu (rain), resembling the Black Emperor. Their skin is black and not flat, with a large head and chubby cheeks, small shoulders and a big belly, moving their hands and feet nimbly, swaying their hips as they walk, and their backs extended. They are not afraid of showing disrespect or being deceitful towards the Shu people and will kill them. Those who can endure autumn and winter but cannot handle spring and summer become sick from the heat. Their sweaty feet have lots of yin sweat. People shaped like great wings are compared to the right foot Yang, on top of the Yang. Little wing-shaped people are compared to the left foot Yang, beneath it in a clean manner. The majority of people are compared to the right foot Yang, beneath it in a clean manner. And the reed-shaped people are compared to the left foot Yang, above it in peace. Therefore, the five shapes of people have 25 variations, and this is what the crowd uses to deceive each other.</p>

<li>
<p>黃帝曰：得其形，不得其色何如？歧伯曰：形勝色，色勝形者，至其勝時年加，感則病行，失則憂矣。形色相得者，富貴大樂。黃帝曰：其形色相勝之時，年加可知乎？歧伯曰：凡年忌下上之人，大忌常加七歲，十六歲、二十五歲、三十四歲、四十三歲、五十二歲、六十一歲皆人之大忌，不可不自安也，感則病行，失則憂矣，當此之時，無為姦事，是謂年忌。
Yellow Emperor asked: What if one acquires the form but not the complexion? How about that? Boyi replied: The form is superior to the complexion, and the complexion is superior to the form at its peak time. When years add on, one feels ill and suffers from diseases. If they are both obtained, great happiness and honor result. Yellow Emperor asked: At the time when the form and complexion are both superior, can one know when the years add on? Boyi replied: Anyone who is above seventy years old, the major taboo is to add seven years every ten years, sixteen years, twenty-five years, thirty-four years, forty-three years, fifty-two years, and sixty-one years. These are major taboos that one must not neglect oneself, feel ill and suffer from diseases. At such a time, without doing anything improper, this is what we call the taboo of adding years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：夫子之言脈之上下，血氣之候似知形氣，奈何？歧伯曰：足陽明之上血氣盛則髯美長，血少氣多則髯短，故氣少血多則髯少，血氣皆少則無髯。兩吻多畫，足陽明之下血氣盛則下毛美長至胸，血多氣少則下毛美短至臍，行則善高舉足，足趾少肉足善寒，血少氣多則肉而善瘃，血氣皆少則無毛有則稀、枯悴，善痿厥，足痺。
Yellow Emperor said: The Master's words relate to the flow of blood and qi above and below. How does this pertain to the formation and appearance of hair? Boyang replied: Abundant blood and qi in the foot Jueyin channel lead to long and luxuriant eyebrows, while deficient blood and abundant qi cause short eyebrows. Hence, if qi is deficient and blood is abundant, the eyebrows will be sparse; if both are deficient, there will be no eyebrows. The upper lips are filled with lines, and in the foot Jueyin channel below, abundant blood and qi lead to long and luxuriant pubic hair that reaches the chest, while an excess of blood and deficient qi results in short pubic hair that is close to the genitals, leading to good gait and high-stepping feet. The soles of the feet have less flesh, which makes them suitable for cold climates. A deficiency of blood and abundance of qi will result in fleshy growths and suitability for sweating. If both are deficient, there may be hair but it will be sparse and dry, leading to weakness, numbness of the feet, and a tendency towards paralysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>足少陽之上，氣血盛則通髯美長，血多氣少則通髯美短，血少氣多則少髯，血氣皆少則無鬚，感於寒濕則善痺。骨痛爪枯也。足少陽之下，血氣盛則脛毛美長，外踝肥；血多氣少則脛毛美短，外踝皮堅而厚，血少氣多則胻毛少，外踝皮薄而軟，血氣皆少則無毛，外踝瘦無肉。
Above the foot <em>yang</em> channel, when qi and blood are abundant, the beard is long and beautiful, and the mustache is long. When there is more blood and less qi, the beard is short, but the mustache is still beautiful. If there is a deficiency of both qi and blood, then there will be no beard. If one is affected by cold and dampness, it is beneficial for the genitals. Bone pain and brittle nails are also indicative. Below the foot <em>yang</em> channel, when qi and blood are abundant, the hair on the calves is beautiful and long, and the outer ankles are plump. When there is more blood but less qi, the hair on the calves is short, the skin of the outer ankles is tough and thick. If there is a deficiency of qi and blood, the hip hair is sparse, the skin of the outer ankles is thin and soft, there will be no hair, and the outer ankles are emaciated with little flesh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>足太陽之上，血氣盛則美眉，眉有毫毛血多氣少則惡眉，面多少理，血少氣多則面多肉，血氣和則美色，足太陽之下，血氣盛則跟肉滿，踵堅，氣少血多則瘦，跟空，血氣皆少則善轉筋，踵下痛。
Above the Jueyin (足太陽) channel, when blood and qi are abundant, there will be beautiful eyebrows; if there is more blood but less qi, the eyebrows will be bad; face with some reason, more blood and less qi result in a meaty face. When blood and qi are balanced, there will be a beautiful complexion. Below the Jueyin channel, when blood and qi are abundant, there is full calf flesh and firm heels. If there is less qi and more blood, one becomes thin, with hollow calves and heels. Blood and qi deficient leads to flexibility of the tendons, and pain in the soles of the feet.</p>

<p>手陽明之上，血氣盛則髭美。血少氣多則髭惡，血氣皆少則無髭。手陽明之下血氣盛則腋下毛美，手魚肉以溫，氣血皆少則手瘦以寒。

<p>黃帝曰：二十五人者，刺之有約乎？歧伯曰：美眉者，足太陽之脈，氣血多，惡眉者，血氣少，其肥而澤者，血氣有餘，肥而不澤者，氣有餘，血不足，瘦而無澤者，氣血俱不足，審察其形氣有餘不足而調之，可以知逆順矣。
Yellow Emperor said: Are there any patterns in the twenty-five men? Duke of Shao replied: Those with good brows, they have an abundance of Qi and blood from the foot Yin (Conception Vessel) channel. Those with bad brows, they have a deficiency of Qi and blood. If someone is fat and not bright, there is an excess of Qi but a deficiency of blood. If someone is thin and not bright, both Qi and blood are deficient. By examining their forms and determining if there is an excess or deficiency, one can discern if they are favorable or unfavorable.</p>

<p>黃帝曰：刺其諸陰陽奈何？歧伯曰：按其寸口人迎，以調陰陽，切循其經絡之凝澀，結而不通者，此於身皆為痛痺，甚則不行，故凝澀，凝澀者，致氣以溫之血和乃止。其結絡者，脈結血不和，決之乃行，故曰：氣有餘於上者，導而下之，氣不足於上者，推而休之，其稽留不至者，因而迎之，必明於經隧，乃能持之，寒與熱爭者，導而行之，其宛陳血不結者，則而予之，必先明知二十五人則血氣之所在，左右上下，刺約畢也。
Yellow Emperor asked: How to pierce the Jueyin? Duke of Shou replied: Press the Conception and Governor points, regulate Yin and Yang, follow the channels and collaterals, tie those that do not connect, in the body all these are painful and stiff, sometimes they cannot move, therefore follow the channels and collaterals, follow the channels and collaterals to regulate the Qi, warm the blood, and bring harmony. For those who are tied, there is excess Qi above, guide it downwards; if the Qi is insufficient above, push it gently; when they hesitate and do not reach the appropriate point, approach it; you must master the path of the channels, so as to be able to hold them. When cold and heat contend, guide them along the path; for those who have no knotted blood, give them medicine; you must first understand the location of the blood and Qi in the twenty-five men, left right upper and lower, pierce and complete.</p>
