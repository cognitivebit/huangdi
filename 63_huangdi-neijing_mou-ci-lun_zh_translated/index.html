<h1 id="_1">繆刺論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：余聞繆刺，未得其意，何謂繆刺。歧伯對曰：夫邪之客於形也，必先舍於皮毛，留而不去，入舍於孫脈，留而不去，入舍於絡脈，留而不去，入舍於經脈，內連五藏，散於腸胃，陰陽俱感，五藏乃傷，此邪之從皮毛而入，極於五藏之次也，如此則治其經焉。今邪客於皮毛，入舍於孫絡，留而不去，閉塞不通，不得入於經，流溢於大絡，而生奇病也。夫邪客大絡者，左注右，右注左，上下左右，與經相干，而布於四末，其氣無常處，不入於經俞，命曰繆刺。帝曰：願聞繆刺，以左取右，以右取左，柰何。其與巨刺何以別之。歧伯曰：邪客於經，左盛則右病，右盛則左病，亦有移易者，左痛未已而右脈先病，如此者，必巨刺之，必中其經，非絡脈也。故絡病者，其痛與經脈繆處，故命曰繆刺。
Yellow Emperor asked: I have heard of needling, but I do not understand its meaning. What is needling? Hua Tuo replied: The pathogenic factor resides in the body and must first be abandoned at the skin and hair, leaving it without being removed, then entering and lodging in the grand yin channel, leaving it without being removed, then entering and lodging in the nutritive vessel channel, leaving it without being removed, then entering and connecting with the five organs, dispersing to the stomach and intestines, and both yin and yang are felt, and the five organs are damaged - this is where the pathogenic factor enters from the skin and hair and is most extreme in damaging the five organs. If so, then treat it by needling the channel. Now, the pathogenic factor resides in the skin and hair, entering and lodging in the grand and nutritive vessels, leaving without being removed, blocking and not passing through to the channel, overflowing to the great vessel, and giving rise to strange diseases. The pathogenic factor in the great vessel, left and right, up and down, left and right, meets with the channel at various points, spreading throughout the four extremities, its qi without a fixed location, not entering the channel orifice, and is called needling. Yellow Emperor asked: I wish to hear about needling, how can I use left to take from the right, and how is it different from the huge needle? Hua Tuo said: The pathogenic factor in the channel, if the left is full then the right is damaged, and if the right is full then the left is damaged, there are also those that move and change, with the left pain not yet subsiding while the right vessel is already damaged - this must be treated with a huge needle, must penetrate the channel, not the nutritive vessel. Therefore, diseases of the nutritive vessel have pain at the channel's needling point, so it is called needling.</p>
<p>2: 帝曰：願聞繆刺柰何，取之何如。歧伯曰：邪客於足少陰之絡，令人卒心痛暴脹，胸脇支滿，無積者，刺然骨之前出血，如食頃而已。不已，左取右，右取左，病新發者取五日已。
The emperor asked, I wish to hear about the method of puncturing a navel and how it is done. Oddly enough, the foreign guest said that when puncturing the navel, one should take care not to damage the small intestine. This can cause severe pain in the person's heart, leading to a bloated chest and abdomen. If there is no accumulation, the needle should be inserted at the front of the bone, causing bleeding. Within a short while, the procedure is complete. However, if it is not yet complete, one should take from the left and put on the right, or vice versa. For a new case that has been ongoing for five days, this treatment is applicable.</p>
<p>3: 邪客於手少陽之絡，令人喉痺舌卷，口乾心煩，臂外廉痛，手不及頭，刺手中指次指爪甲上，去端如韭葉各一痏，壯者立已，老者有頃已，左取右，右取左，此新病數日已。
The evil guest in the hand is connected to the small intestine, causing sore throat and dry mouth, making people uncomfortable. The pain is in the arm, but the hand cannot catch up to the head. There are needles inserted into the center and the sides of the fingertips and nail plates, with a small piece removed from each like the leaves of chives. This new condition has persisted for several days.</p>
<p>4: 邪客於足厥陰之絡，令人卒疝暴痛，刺足大指爪甲上與肉交者各一痏，男子立已，女子有頃已，左取右，右取左。
The evil intruder attacks the region of the ankle joint, causing sudden and severe lower back pain. There are two acupoints for this condition: one on the top of the big toe's nail and the other at the junction of the meat and the nail. For males, relief comes instantly, while for females, it takes a little longer. Treat by pressing left points with the right hand and vice versa</p>
<p>5: 邪客於足太陽之絡，令人頭項肩痛，刺足小指爪甲上，與肉交者各一痏，立已，不已，刺外踝下三痏，左取右，右取左，如食頃已。
The evil guest (disease) attacks the network of the soles of the feet, causing head, neck, and shoulder pain. It pierces the skin at the base of the small toe, joining with flesh, with three prongs each on the right and left, until finished. Then, it pierces below the ankle three times, alternating between left and right, like eating a moment ago.</p>
<p>6: 邪客於手陽明之絡，令人氣滿，胸中喘息，而支胠胸中熱，刺手大指次指爪甲上，去端如韭葉各一痏，左取右，右取左，如食頃已。
The evil guest at the Yangming festival seized my sleeve, causing me to feel suffocated and gasping for breath, while sweat poured down from my brow, and needles pierced the back of my hand, claws and nails all showing bare spots like young leeks. Left and right were taken alternately, right and left already finished in a short time.</p>
<p>7: 邪客於臂掌之閒，不可得屈，刺其踝後，先以指按之痛，乃刺之，以月死生為數，月生一日一痏，二日二痏，十五日十五痏，十六日十四痏。邪客於足陽蹻之脈，令人目痛從內眥始，刺外踝之下半寸所各二痏，左刺右，右刺左，如行十里頃而已。人有所墮墜，惡血留內，腹中滿脹，不得前後，先飲利藥，此上傷厥陰之脈，下傷少陰之絡，刺足內踝之下，然骨之前血脈出血，刺足跗上動脈，不已，刺三毛上各一痏，見血立已，左刺右，右刺左。善悲驚不樂，刺如右方。
The evil guest is idle at the elbow and wrist, and cannot be bent. Stab at the back of the heel, first press with the finger to cause pain before stabbing. Count life and death by the days of the month: one day one swelling, two days two swellings, fifteen days fifteen swellings, sixteen days fourteen swellings. The evil guest at the foot's Yang-spring point strikes a blood vessel, causing eye pain starting from the inner corner. Stab below the outer heel, each about two inches apart, left and right, then right and left, like walking ten li and done. If a person falls and injures themselves, the evil blood remains inside, the abdomen is full and bloated, unable to move forward or backward. First drink the nourishing medicine, this is needling the Jueyin vessel above and the Shaoyin channel below. Needle the inner heel below, but the bone's front blood vessel bleeds. Needle the dorsalis pedis artery on the foot, not finished, needle three hairs above each one, see the blood and stop, left and right, right and left. Responding to sadness, shock, and grief without joy, needling as on the right side</p>
<p>8: 邪客於手陽明之絡，令人耳聾時不聞音，刺手大指次指爪甲上，去端如韭葉各一痏，立聞，不已，刺中指爪甲上與肉交者，立聞，其不時聞者，不可刺也。耳中生風者，亦刺之如此數，左刺右，右刺左。
The evil visitor grabs the Yang Ming tendon, causing one to be deaf and not hear any sound. Piercing with the thumb, index finger, and claw-like fingertips, remove a piece of skin the size of a slice of chive from each location, then listen attentively without stopping. When piercing the tip where the fingernail meets the flesh, listen attentively, and if one cannot hear at times, it is not suitable to pierce. If there is wind generated inside the ear, pierce in this manner as well, left first and right afterwards, then right first and left afterwards.</p>
<p>9: 凡痺往來行無常處者，在分肉閒痛而刺之，以月死生為數用針者，隨氣盛衰以為痏數，針過其日數則脫氣，不及日數則氣不寫，左刺右，右刺左，病已，止，不已，復刺之如法，月生一日一痏，二日二痏，漸多之，十五日十五痏，十六日十四痏，漸少之。
For those who are constantly traveling and experiencing changes, when they have idle time and feel a little uncomfortable, they use acupuncture needles to count their days of life. The number of needles corresponds with the strength of qi, and if the needles go through the number of days, they will exhale. If it does not reach the number of days, their qi will not settle. They insert needles on both sides, then switch to the other side. When the illness is gone, they stop, but if it persists, they continue to treat as usual. Each day of life corresponds with one needle, two days with two needles, gradually increasing to fifteen days with fifteen needles and sixteen days with fourteen needles, gradually decreasing.</p>
<p>10: 邪客於足陽明之經，令人鼽衂上齒寒，刺足中指次指爪甲上，與肉交者各一痏，左刺右，右刺左。
The evil client, at the sole of the foot's Brightness Classic, causes people to yawn and shiver with cold. Stab the center of the foot between the toes, near the nail root; there is one grain-sized knot each time, left pricks right, right pricks left.</p>
<p>11: 邪客於足少陽之絡，令人脇痛不得息，欬而汗出，刺足小指次指爪甲上，與肉交者各一痏，不得息立已，汗出立止，欬者溫衣飲食一日已，左刺右，右刺左，病立已，不已，復刺如法。
The evil guest resided in the shao yang network, causing people to have flank pain that would not let up. When they took a sip and sweat profusely, I inserted needles at the small toe and second toe nails where flesh meets nails; each time there was one grain of rice, and it would not let up, and they sweat persistently. If someone who grunted had worn warm clothes and eaten food for a day, then on one side, insert right and on the other side, insert left. When they were sick, they did not stop; they continued to insert as appropriate</p>
<p>12: 邪客於足少陰之絡，令人嗌痛不可內食，無故善怒氣上走賁上，刺足下中央之脈各三痏，凡六刺，立已，左刺右，右刺左。嗌中腫不能內，唾時不能出唾者，刺然骨之前，出血立已，左刺右，右刺左。
The evil guest is at the foot's lesser yin channel, causing pain and irritation in the urethra and making it difficult to urinate. For no apparent reason, the person becomes easily angered and agitated, with symptoms of heat rising upwards. Six needles are inserted: one needle in each of the three yuan-points along the foot-taiyang channel, starting from the center point. When inserting these needles, alternate between left and right sides. If there is a swelling inside the urethra that cannot be relieved by urination or if saliva cannot be spat out, needle the qi men (front midline) point of the bladder channel and obtain a small amount of blood. Again, alternate between left and right sides</p>
<p>13: 邪客於足太陰之絡，令人腰痛，引少腹控䏚，不可以仰息，刺腰尻之解兩胂之上是腰俞，以月死生為痏數，發鍼立已，左刺右，右刺左。
The evil guest resides in the Sinew Channel of the Foot-Taiyang, causing lower back pain and referral to the lower abdomen, leading to weakness in the waist. The patient cannot take deep breaths. To treat this condition, insert needles at the junction of the Sinew Channel of the Foot-Taiyang above the two muscles, use the pulse for guidance, and alternately needle the left and right sides.</p>
<p>14: 邪客於足太陽之絡，令人拘攣背急，引脇而痛，刺之從項始數脊椎俠脊，疾按之應手如痛，刺之傍三痏，立已。
The malevolent guest strikes at the soles of the feet, causing one to be stiff and have a sore back, pulling the ribs and causing pain. When pierced from the forehead, it counts along the spine to the nape of the neck, striking as if hurting the hand. When pierced by the sides of the three folds (or three vertebrae), it stops there.</p>
<p>15: 邪客於足少陽之絡，令人留於樞中痛髀不可舉，刺樞中以毫鍼，寒則久留鍼，以月死生為數，立已。
The evil guest is in the shao Yang channel, causing people to have pain in their hips that makes it difficult to stand, and a needle is inserted into the shao Yang channel with an acupuncture needle. If it's cold, the needle stays for a long time, counting days of life and death, and then stop.</p>
<p>Note: This text seems to be describing a traditional Chinese medical treatment involving acupuncture and is written in literary Chinese.</p>
<p>16: 治諸經刺之所過者，不病，則繆刺之。耳聾，刺手陽明，不已，刺其通脈出耳前者。齒齲，刺手陽明，不已，刺其脈入齒中，立已。邪客於五藏之閒，其病也，脈引而痛，時來時止，視其病，繆刺之於手足爪甲上，視其脈，出其血，閒日一刺，一刺不已，五刺已。繆傳引上齒，齒脣寒痛，視其手背脈血者去之，足陽明中指爪甲上大痏，手大指次指爪甲上各一痏，立已，左取右，右取左。
For treatment of conditions encountered during the insertion of needles, if there is no illness, continue with the needle. For deafness and hearing impairment, use the hand Jinmen, do not stop until the needle comes out in front of the ear. For toothache or gum pain, use the hand Jinmen, do not stop until the needle reaches the tooth root. Stand up straight when finished.
