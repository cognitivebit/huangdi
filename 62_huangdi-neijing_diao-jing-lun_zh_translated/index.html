<h1 id="_1">調經論</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：余聞刺法言，有餘寫之，不足補之，何謂有餘，何謂不足。歧伯對曰：有餘有五，不足亦有五，帝欲何問。帝曰；願盡聞之。歧伯曰：神有餘有不足，氣有餘有不足，血有餘有不足，形有餘有不足，志有餘有不足，凡此十者，其氣不等也。帝曰：人有精氣津液，四支九竅，五藏十六部，三百六十五節，乃生百病，百病之生，皆有虛實，今夫子乃言有餘有五，不足亦有五，何以生之乎。歧伯曰：皆生於五藏也。夫心藏神，肺藏氣，肝藏血，脾藏肉，腎藏志，而此成形，志意通內連骨髓，而成身形五藏，五藏之道，皆出於經隧以行血氣，血氣不和，百病乃變化而生，是故守經隧焉。
Yellow Emperor asked, saying: I have heard that acupuncture discusses more than enough and insufficient, but there are no specific descriptions of either. What does more than enough mean, and what does insufficient mean? Huan Di replied: More than enough has five aspects, and insufficient also has five aspects; what do you want to ask, Emperor? The Emperor said: I wish to hear fully about them. Huan Di said: There is more than enough and insufficient in spirit, qi, blood, form, and willpower. In total, these ten aspects have unbalanced qi. People have vital energy and body fluids, four limbs and nine orifices, five organs and sixteen departments, three hundred sixty-five joints, which give rise to one hundred diseases, and the generation of these hundred diseases is a mixture of reality and emptiness. Now, Master, you say there are more than enough and insufficient aspects; how do they generate them? Huan Di replied: They all arise from the five organs. The heart houses spirit, the lungs house qi, the liver houses blood, the spleen houses flesh, the kidneys house willpower, and this forms the body. Will and intention connect to the bone marrow within, forming the body's shape through the five organs. The way of the five organs is all derived from the meridians and vessels, and regulating blood and qi leads to the transformation and generation of one hundred diseases; therefore, protect the meridians and vessels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：神有餘不足何如。歧伯曰：神有餘則笑不休，神不足則悲。血氣未并，五藏安定，邪客於形，洒淅起於毫毛，未入於經絡也，故命曰神之微。帝曰：補寫柰何。歧伯曰：神有餘，則寫其小絡之血，出血勿之深斥，無中其大經，神氣乃平。神不足者，視其虛絡，按而致之，刺而利之，無出其血，無泄其氣，以通其經，神氣乃平。帝曰：刺微柰何。歧伯曰：按摩勿釋，著鍼勿斥，移氣於不足，神氣乃得復。
The Emperor asked: What is it like when there is an excess or deficiency of the spirit?  Huzi replied: When there is an excess of the spirit, one cannot stop laughing; when there is a deficiency of the spirit, one cannot stop weeping. Before the blood and qi have been combined, and the five organs have become stable, evil spirits attack the surface of the body and emerge from the hair follicles without entering the channels, hence it is called the subtle manifestation of the spirit. The Emperor asked: What are the prescriptions for supplementation? Huzi replied: If there is an excess of the spirit, write down the points of small vessels to bleed, but do not let the bleeding be too deep; without focusing on the major channels, the spirit's qi will become balanced. For one with a deficiency of the spirit, observe the empty vessels, press and bring them to life, pierce and make them sharp, but do not let any blood come out nor any qi leak, to open up the channels, and the spirit's qi will become balanced. The Emperor asked: What is needle-poking in small amounts? Huzi replied: Do not massage too much, refrain from using needles too often, guide the qi towards where there is a deficiency, and the spirit's qi will recover</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。有餘不足柰何。歧伯曰：氣有餘則喘欬，上氣不足，則息利少氣。血氣未并，五藏安定，皮膚微病，命曰白氣微泄。帝曰：補寫柰何。歧伯曰：氣有餘，則寫其經隧，無傷其經，無出其血，無泄其氣。不足，則補其經隧，無出其氣。帝曰：刺微柰何。歧伯曰：按摩勿釋，出鍼視之，曰我將深之，適人必革，精氣自伏，邪氣散亂，無所休息，氣泄腠理，真氣乃相得。
Emperor: Good. What if there is still not enough? Master Qi Bo said: If there is excessive qi, it will cause panting and shortness of breath; if there is not enough qi, the breathing will be shallow. The blood and qi are not yet united, the five organs are stable, the skin has a slight illness, and it is called white qi leaking. Emperor: What should be supplemented? Master Qi Bo said: If there is excessive qi, write its meridians, without damaging its meridians, without bleeding it, or leaking its qi. If it is not sufficient, supplement the meridians without leaking its qi. Emperor: How shall I acupuncture it? Master Qi Bo said: Gently massage without releasing, observe the needle and say, I will go deep, appropriate people must be cured, essential qi will retreat, evil qi will scatter and be disordered, with no place to rest, leaking qi damages the channels, and true qi comes together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。血有餘不足，柰何。歧伯曰：血有餘則怒，不足則恐。血氣未并，五藏安定，孫絡水溢，則經有留血。帝曰：補寫柰何。歧伯曰：血有餘，則寫其盛經出其血。不足，則視其虛經內鍼其脈中，久留而視，脈大，疾出其鍼，無令血泄。帝曰：刺留血，柰何。歧伯曰：視其血絡，刺出其血，無令惡血得入於經，以成其疾。
The Emperor said: Good. Is there not enough blood or is it excessive? Qi Bo said: If there is an excess of blood, one will be angry; if there is insufficient blood, one will be afraid. If the vital energy has not been harmonized and the five organs are in equilibrium, the channels may overflow with fluid, leading to retained blood in the meridians. The Emperor said: How should it be treated? Qi Bo said: If there is an excess of blood, record the amount of bleeding and let the blood. If there is insufficient blood, observe the empty channels and insert needles into the meridians to facilitate healing over time. When the pulse becomes strong and the bleeding speeds up, withdraw the needle without causing any leakage of blood. The Emperor said: How should the retained blood be drained? Qi Bo said: Observe the flow of blood and drain it from the channels, ensuring that no negative blood enters the meridians, thereby completing the process swiftly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。形有餘不足柰何。歧伯曰：形有餘則腹脹涇溲不利，不足則四支不用。血氣未并，五藏安定，肌肉蠕動，命曰微風。帝曰：補寫柰何。歧伯曰：形有餘則寫其陽經，不足則補其陽絡。帝曰：刺微柰何。歧伯曰：取分肉間，無中其經，無傷其絡，衛氣得復，邪氣乃索。
Emperor said: Good. If the body has excess, then [the person] may have difficulty breathing and defecating, and if it lacks sufficient qi, then the four limbs will not function well. Blood and qi are not harmonious, the five organs are stable, the muscles and tendons are twitching, and this is called minute wind. Emperor asked: What is supplementation? The Grand Duke said: If the body has excess, then write its yang channel, and if it lacks sufficient qi, then supplement its yang vessels. Emperor asked: What about acupuncture? The Grand Duke said: Take a small amount of meat between the layers, find the meridian without damaging the vessels, restore the defensive qi, and expel the pathogenic qi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。志有餘不足柰何。歧伯曰：志有餘則腹脹飱泄，不足則厥。血氣未并，五藏安定，骨節有動。帝曰：補寫柰何。歧伯曰：志有餘則寫然筋血者，不足則補其復溜。帝曰：刺未并柰何。歧伯曰：即取之，無中其經，邪所乃能立虛。
The Emperor said: Good. If the will is abundant but not yet sufficient, how about? The Duke of Shou replied: If the will is abundant, it will distend the abdomen and cause diarrhea; if it is insufficient, then it will fail. The blood and qi are not yet united, the five organs are securely settled, and the bones and joints have movement. Emperor asked: How to supplement? The Duke of Shou replied: If the will is abundant, then write down the sinew-blood; if it is insufficient, then supplement its leaks. Emperor asked: What about acupuncture? The Duke of Shou replied: Just take it, find the meridian in the middle, and that is where disease can establish a foundation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。余已聞虛實之形，不知其何以生。歧伯曰：氣血以并，陰陽相傾，氣亂於衛，血逆於經，血氣離居，一實一虛。血并於陰，氣并於陽，故為驚狂。血并於陽，氣并於陰，乃為炅中。血并於上，氣并於下，心煩惋善怒。血并於下，氣并於上，亂而喜忘。帝曰：血并於陰，氣并於陽，如是血氣離居，何者為實，何者為虛。歧伯曰：血氣者，喜溫而惡寒，寒則泣不能流，溫則消而去之。是故氣之所并為血虛，血之所并為氣虛。帝曰：人之所有者，血與氣耳。今夫子乃言血并為虛，氣并為虛，是無實乎。歧伯曰：有者為實，無者為虛，故氣并則無血，血并則無氣，今血與氣相失，故為虛焉。絡之與孫脈俱輸於經，血與氣并，則為實焉。血之與氣并走於上，則為大厥，厥則暴死，氣復反則生，不反則死。帝曰：實者何道從來，虛者何道從去，虛實之要，願聞其故。歧伯曰：夫陰與陽，皆有俞會，陽注於陰，陰滿之外，陰陽勻平，以充其形，九候若一，命曰平人。
Emperor: Good. I have already heard about the forms of truth and falsehood, but I do not know how they come into being. Duke of Shou said: Qi and blood intermingle, yin and yang are tilted, qi is chaotic in the Wei, blood rebels in the meridians, qi and blood are separated, one is true and one is false. Blood gathers in the yin, qi gathers in the yang, hence it becomes mania. Blood gathers in the yang, qi gathers in the yin, which leads to coma. Emperor: If blood gathers in the yin and qi gathers in the yang, and this is a case of qi and blood being separated, what is true and what is false? Duke of Shou said: Qi and blood, which like warmth and dislike cold, cry without being able to flow when it's cold, and dissipate when it's warm. Therefore, where qi gathers, blood is false, and where blood gathers, qi is false. Emperor: People have both qi and blood. Now Master Zhou says that blood gathering is false and qi gathering is false, does this mean there is no truth? Duke of Shou said: What exists is true, what doesn't exist is false. Since there is a lack of qi and blood in balance, it becomes false. When the qi and blood are connected with the channels, it becomes true. Blood and qi rise to the upper part, which leads to grand mal seizure. Grand mal seizure causes violent death, and if qi reverses it can lead to recovery, but without reversal it results in death. Emperor: What is the truth of yin and yang? What is the path of falsehood? I wish to hear about the essence of falsehood and truth. Duke of Shou said: Yin and yang have their own balance. Yang nourishes yin, and yin fulfills the outer space of yang. When yin and yang are leveled, they fill each other and maintain their forms, just like the nine phases being one. It is called the even person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>夫邪之生也，或生於陰，或生於陽。其生於陽者，得之風雨寒暑。其生於陰者，得之飲食居處，陰陽喜怒。帝曰：風雨之傷人柰何。歧伯曰：風雨之傷人也，先客於皮膚，傳入於孫脈，孫脈滿則傳入於絡脈，絡脈滿則輸於大經脈，血氣與邪并客於分腠之閒，其脈堅大，故曰實。實者外堅充滿，不可按之，按之則痛。帝曰：寒濕之傷人柰何。歧伯曰：寒濕之中人也，皮膚不收，肌肉堅緊，榮血泣，衛氣去，故曰虛。虛者聶辟氣不足，按之則氣足以溫之，故快然而不痛。帝曰：善。陰之生實柰何。歧伯曰：喜怒不節，則陰氣上逆，上逆則下虛，下虛則陽氣走之，故曰實矣。帝曰：陰之生虛柰何。歧伯曰：喜則氣下，悲則氣消，消則脈虛空，因寒飲食，寒氣熏滿，則血泣氣去，故曰虛矣。
The Emperor asked: How is evil born? It can be born from Yin or Yang. The one born from Yang receives the harm of wind and rain. The one born from Yin receives harm from drink, food, dwelling place, and emotional disturbance. Emperor asked: How does wind and rain injure a person?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Guan Pu answered: Wind and rain injure a person by first attacking the skin. They penetrate into the muscle vessels, then into the tendons vessels, and finally into the great vessel. The blood and qi, along with evil, lodge in the dividing space of the brain, causing a hard and swollen pulse, hence it is called Real.</p>
<p>Real refers to a hard, full feeling that cannot be pushed, but if pushed it will hurt. Emperor asked: How does cold and damp injury a person?</p>
<p>Guan Pu answered: Cold and damp injure the middle-energy of a person by not allowing the skin to contract and tightening the muscles. The defense qi leaves, hence it is called Empty.</p>
<p>Empty refers to being deafened in the energy and not feeling warm, but when pressed it feels warm, hence it resolves quickly without pain. Emperor asked: Good.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How does Yang generate Real?</p>
<p>Guan Pu answered: Lack of self-control in joy and anger generates Yin energy. When Yin energy ascends, it causes the lower energy to be empty. An empty lower energy allows Yang energy to move freely, hence it is called Real.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How does Yin generate Empty?</p>
<p>Guan Pu answered: Delight causes the energy to descend and grief causes the energy to dissipate. The pulse becomes empty and weak, leading to cold, drink, and food. Cold qi fills the body, hence blood and qi leave, causing it to be called Empty.</p>

<li>帝曰：經言陽虛則外寒，陰虛則內熱，陽盛則外熱，陰盛則內寒，余已聞之矣，不知其所由然也。歧伯曰：陽受氣於上焦，以溫皮膚分肉之閒。令寒氣在外，則上焦不通，上焦不通，則寒氣獨留於外，故寒慄。帝曰：陰虛生內熱柰何。歧伯曰：有所勞倦，形氣衰少，穀氣不盛，上焦不行，下脘不通，胃氣熱，熱氣熏胸中，故內熱。帝曰：陽盛生外熱柰何。歧伯曰：上焦不通利，則皮膚緻密腠理閉塞，玄府不通，衛氣不得泄越，故外熱。帝曰：陰盛生內寒柰何。歧伯曰：厥氣上逆，寒氣積於胸中而不寫，不寫則溫氣去，寒獨留，則血凝泣，凝則脈不通，其脈盛大以濇，故中寒。
Emperor: I have heard that when yang is deficient, there is external cold and when yin is deficient, there is internal heat. When yang is abundant, there is external heat and when yin is abundant, there is internal cold. I do not know how it works. </li>
</ol>
<p>Huang Di (Yellow Emperor): Yang absorbs qi in the Middle Burner, warming the skin and keeping the muscles and flesh nourished. If cold qi remains outside, the Middle Burner will not open, leading to cold qi remaining outside and causing a chill. </p>
<p>Emperor: How does yin deficiency lead to internal heat? </p>
<p>Huang Di: It is caused by overwork or exhaustion, with body qi weakened and the qi of grain insufficient. The Middle Burner is not functioning properly, the Lower Burner is not open, the stomach qi is hot, and the heat rises to the chest cavity, causing internal heat. </p>
<p>Emperor: How does yang excess cause external heat? </p>
<p>Huang Di: If the Middle Burner is not functioning smoothly, the skin and muscles are tight and pores are closed, obstructing the orifices of the Mysterious Gate and preventing the release of defensive qi. This leads to external heat. </p>
<p>Emperor: How does yin excess cause internal cold? </p>
<p>Huang Di: The governing qi rises upwards, and cold qi accumulates in the chest while not being discharged, causing the dispersing qi to depart. With cold remaining alone, blood congeals and stagnates, leading to blocked blood vessels. The pulse becomes large and irregular, causing internal cold.</p>

<p>帝曰：陰與陽并，血氣以并，病形以成，刺之柰何。歧伯曰：刺此者，取之經隧，取血於營，取氣於衛，用形哉，因四時多少高下。帝曰：血氣以并，病形以成，陰陽相傾，補寫柰何。歧伯曰：寫實者氣盛乃內鍼，鍼與氣俱內，以開其門如利其戶，鍼與氣俱出，精氣不傷，邪氣乃下，外門不閉，以出其疾，搖大其道，如利其路，是謂大寫，必切而出，大氣乃屈。帝曰：補虛柰何。歧伯曰：持鍼勿置，以定其意，候呼內鍼，氣出鍼入，鍼空四塞，精無從去，方實而疾出鍼，氣入鍼出，熱不得還，閉塞其門，邪氣布散，精氣乃得存，動氣候時，近氣不失，遠氣乃來，是謂追之。
Emperor said: Yin and Yang are combined, blood and Qi are combined, the disease pattern is formed, what shall I do with needle? Hua Bo said: Needling this point, taking from the meridian, drawing blood in the camp, drawing Qi in the Wei, using shape, according to the four seasons' abundance and scarcity. Emperor said: Blood and Qi are combined, disease pattern is formed, Yin and Yang are tilted, how to rectify? Hua Bo said: If it is real, when Qi is full, insert needle internally, needle and Qi enter together, open its door like sharpening its door, needle and Qi exit together, preciously Qi does not get hurt, pathogenic Qi sinks down, the outer door does not close, let it out its rush, enlarge its path, like sharpening its road, this is called great rectification, must cut off and exit, great Qi gets bent. Emperor said: How to supplement vacuity? Hua Bo said: Hold needle without placing it, establish its intention, wait for internal Qi to come out, needle enters Qi, space without a place for Qi to go, real and rush out the needle, Qi enters and exits from the needle, heat does not return, close its door, pathogenic Qi disperses, preciously Qi can stay, moving Qi according to time, near Qi does not get lost, far Qi comes, this is called pursuit.</p>

<p>帝曰：夫子言虛實者有十，生於五藏，五藏五脈耳。夫十二經脈，皆生其病，今夫子獨言五藏，夫十二經脈者，皆絡三百六十五節，節有病，必被經脈，經脈之病，皆有虛實，何以合之。歧伯曰：五藏者，故得六府與為表裏，經絡支節，各生虛實，其病所居，隨而調之。病在脈，調之血。病在血，調之絡。病在氣，調之衛。病在肉，調之分肉。病在筋，調之筋。病在骨，調之骨。燔鍼劫刺其下，及與急者。病在骨，焠鍼藥熨。病不知所痛，兩蹻為上。身形有痛，九候莫病，則繆刺之。痛在於左而右脈病者，巨刺之。必謹察其九候，鍼道備矣。
Emperor: The Master says that there are ten kinds of emptiness and reality. They are born in the Five Zang organs and the Five Vessels. The Twelve Channels and Vessels all give rise to disease, and now the Master speaks only of the Five Zang, while the Twelve Channels and Vessels are all connected with the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five points. When a point is diseased, it must be treated by the channels and vessels; the diseases of the channels and vessels all have emptiness and reality. How can they be unified? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Duke Xiao asked: The Five Zang organs are the basis for the Six Depths and Reaches, and the Channels, Collaterals, and Points all give rise to emptiness and reality. Wherever the disease is located, one should treat it accordingly. Disease in the channel, treat with blood. Disease in the blood, treat with channels and collaterals. Disease in the Qi, treat with defense Qi. Disease in the flesh, treat with division of flesh. Disease in the sinews, treat with sinews. Disease in the bones, treat with bone-setting methods. With needle or knife, cut below and join with urgent cases. When disease is in the bones, use fire needles and medicine to warm. When the disease is not known where it hurts, use two needle techniques above. If there is pain on the left side and the right channel is diseased, use large needle techniques. Be sure to carefully observe the nine signs, and the method is secure.</p>
