<h1 id="_1">九鍼十二原</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問於歧伯曰：余子萬民，養百姓而收其租稅；余哀其不給而屬有疾病。余欲勿使被毒藥，無用砭石，欲以微鍼通其經脈，調其血氣，榮其逆順出入之會。令可傳於後世，必明為之法，令終而不滅，久而不絕，易用難忘，為之經紀，異其章，別其表裏，為之終始。令各有形，先立鍼經。願聞其情。
The Yellow Emperor asked Yi Bo, saying: My son has a hundred subjects and is responsible for nurturing the people while collecting their taxes. I feel sorry that he does not give them anything in return, but they are afflicted by various diseases. He wishes to avoid using poisonous drugs and will not use a scalpel, instead wanting to open their channels and regulate their blood and qi, restoring the harmony of their yin and yang flow. This method can be passed down through future generations, becoming widely recognized as a law, lasting forever without disappearing, easily remembered but difficult to forget. He records this as the Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, making it distinct in form and content. I hope to hear more about its meaning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯答曰：臣請推而次之，令有綱紀，始於一，終於九焉。請言其道！小鍼之要，易陳而難入。麤守形，上守神。神乎神，客在門。未覩其疾，惡知其原？刺之微在速遲。麤守關，上守機，機之動，不離其空。空中之機，清靜而微。其來不可逢，其往不可追。知機之道者，不可掛以發。不知機道，扣之不發。知其往來，要與之期。麤之闇乎，妙哉，工獨有之。往者為逆，來者為順，明知逆順，正行無問。迎而奪之，惡得無虛？追而濟之，惡得無實？迎之隨之，以意和之，鍼道畢矣。
Duke Zhou replied: I would ask you to extend it and then examine the next line. The record begins with one and ends with nine. Please explain its meaning! The essence of Xiaotou is difficult to master once described but easy to grasp. Guarding the form, guarding the divine. Which divine? The guest is at the door. I have not yet seen how fast it is, but I know where it comes from. The slightest prick is swift and quick. Guarding the gate, guarding the mechanism, the movement of which never strays from its openness. The mechanism in the open is clear and quiet, subtle. It cannot be met when it arrives, nor pursued when it departs. Those who know the way of the mechanism can be sent out without fail. Those who do not know the way of the mechanism cannot be sent out. Knowing its coming and going requires setting a rendezvous. The darkness of Xiaotou is indeed remarkable, a technique unique to the craftsman. Going back was reversed, and coming forward was in order, knowing reversal and order, there is no doubt. Seize it and take it away, regrettably without deception? Pursue it and save it, regrettably without sincerity? Seize it along with it, follow it with your intent, and the way of the Xiaotou will be complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡用鍼者，虛則實之，滿則泄之，宛陳則除之，邪勝則虛之。大要曰：徐而疾則實，疾而徐則虛。言實與虛，若有若無。察後與先。若存若亡。為虛與實，若得若失。
The one who practices acupuncture, if there is emptiness, it will fill; if there is fullness, it will disperse; if it persists, it will be eliminated; if the disease wins, it will be emptied. The great principle is: acting slowly and quickly it becomes real, acting quickly and slowly it becomes empty. Real and empty are as they may or may not be. Examine what comes later and what comes earlier. If there is existence, there may also be extinction. For the real and the empty, it may be obtained or lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>虛實之要，九鍼最妙，補寫之時，以鍼為之。寫曰，必持內之，放而出之，排陽得鍼，邪氣得泄。按而引鍼，是謂內溫，血不得散，氣不得出也。補曰，隨之隨之，意若妄之。若行若按，如蚊虻止，如留如還，去如弦絕，令左屬右，其氣故止，外門已閉，中氣乃實，必無留血，急取誅之。
The skill of the nine needles lies in their subtlety. When supplementing, use needles. It is written that one must hold the inside while sending it out, sorting out the Yang and getting the needles to the right spot, expelling evil Qi. Pressing and guiding the needle is known as internal heat, blood not dispersing, and Qi not being released. Supplementation says, follow along following, like a false intention. If you move and press, like a mosquito bite, like leaving and returning, going like a plucked string, make left side and right side, stopping the Qi, and the external door is closed. The internal Qi becomes real, there will be no remaining blood, and it must be urgently killed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>持鍼之道，堅者為寶。正指直刺，無鍼左右。神在秋毫，屬意病者。審視血脈者，刺之無殆。方刺之時，必在懸陽，及與兩衛。神屬勿去，知病存亡。血脈者在俞橫居，視之獨澄，切之獨堅。
The art of holding the acupuncture needle, firmness is a treasure. Correctly pointing straight and not left or right. The spirit resides in the autumn hair tip, belonging to intention disease. Observing the pulse, pierce with no excess. The time of puncturing must be at suspension Yang and where the two guards are. The spirit belongs to not leave, knowing the disease's existence and death. Pulse is located in Gu Horizontal Lodge, viewing it alone becomes clear, cutting it alone becomes firm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>九鍼之名，各不同形。一曰鑱鍼，長一寸六分；二曰員鍼，長一寸六分；三曰鍉鍼，長三寸半；四曰鋒鍼，長一寸六分；五曰鈹鍼，長四寸，廣二分半；六曰員利鍼，長一寸六分；七曰毫鍼，長三寸六分；八曰長鍼，長七寸；九曰大鍼，長四寸。鑱鍼者，頭大末銳，去寫陽氣；員鍼者，鍼如卵形，揩摩分間，不得傷肌肉，以寫分氣；鍉鍼者，鋒如黍粟之銳，主按脈勿陷，以致其氣；鋒鍼者，刃三隅以發痼疾，鈹鍼者，末如劍鋒，以取大膿；員利鍼者，大如釐，且員且銳，中身微大，以取暴氣；毫鍼者，尖如蚊虻喙，靜以徐往，微以久留之而養，以取痛痺；長鍼者，鋒利身薄，可以取遠痺；大鍼者，尖如梃，其鋒微員，以寫機關之水也。九鍼畢矣。
The Nine Needles and Their Names, Each with a Different Shape: 
One is called the Jade Needle, measuring one inch and six tenths; 
Two is called the Embracing Needle, also measuring one inch and six tenths; 
Three is called the Three-leg Needle, measuring three and a half inches; 
Four is called the Pointed Needle, measuring one inch and six tenths; 
Five is called the Haw Needle, measuring four inches and two tenths; 
Six is called the Double-edged Needle, also measuring one inch and six tenths; 
Seven is called the Hair Needle, measuring three and a half inches; 
Eight is called the Long Needle, measuring seven inches; 
Nine is called the Great Needle, measuring four inches. 
The Jade Needle is large at the head and sharp at the tip, expelling the Yang Qi; 
The Embracing Needle has a needle shape like an egg, tapping and probing between intervals without injuring the muscles, expelling the Qi; 
The Three-leg Needle has a sharp tip like the point of millet grain, primarily for pressing the pulse so as not to deplete the Qi; 
The Pointed Needle is three-sided at the tip to treat pain and inflammation, (the haw needle) has a sharp tip like a sword, used to draw out pus; 
The Double-edged Needle is large with both embracing and sharp tips, its small body drawing out violent Qi; 
The Hair Needle is sharp like a mosquito's proboscis, slowly and gently advancing while lingering so as to nourish and treat pain and numbness; 
The Long Needle has a sharp, slender tip capable of treating distant pain; 
The Great Needle has a sharp tip like the point of an awl, used to treat water metastasis. The nine needles are complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>夫氣之在脈也，邪氣在上，濁氣在中，清氣在下。故鍼陷脈則邪氣出，鍼中脈則濁氣出，鍼太深則邪氣反沉、病益。故曰：皮肉筋脈，各有所處。病各有所宜。各不同形，各以任其所宜，無實無虛。損不足而益有餘，是謂甚病。病益甚，取五脈者死，取三脈者恇；奪陰者死，奪陽者狂，鍼害畢矣。
A physician said: The Qi is in the pulse. Evil Qi is at the top, turbid Qi is in the middle, and clear Qi is at the bottom. Therefore, when needling the pulse, the evil Qi will exit; when needling the middle of the pulse, the turbid Qi will exit; and if the needle goes too deep, the evil Qi will sink and the illness will worsen. Thus it is said: skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels all have their proper locations. Each disease has its own remedy. Each is different in appearance, and each should be treated according to its proper remedy, without reality or falsehood. A condition that is not enough but has an excess, this is called a severe illness. If the illness worsens, if one takes five pulses, they will die; if three pulses, it is dangerous; if one takes the Yin, they will die; if one takes the Yang, they will go mad, and the needling is finished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>刺之而氣不至，無問其數。刺之而氣至，乃去之，勿復鍼。鍼各有所宜，各不同形，各任其所，為刺之要。氣至而有效，效之信，若風之吹云，明乎若見蒼天，刺之道畢矣。
Pierce without the qi arriving, and there is no need to count the number. Pierce until the qi arrives, at which point remove it and do not poke again. Each acupuncture needle has its own purpose, each with a different shape, fitting its respective location as necessary for poking. When the qi arrives and is effective, trust in the effectiveness, as when wind blows away clouds, it becomes clear as if seeing the blue sky; the method of poking is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：願聞五藏六府所出之處。歧伯曰：五藏五俞，五五二十五俞，六府六俞，六六三十六俞，經脈十二，絡脈十五，凡二十七氣，以上下。所出為井，所溜為滎，所注為俞，所行為經，所入為合，二十七氣所行，皆在五俞也。
Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear the locations where the Five Organs and Six Courts originate from. Qi Bo replied: The Five Organs consist of five Yin and five Yang, totaling twenty-five Yin. The Six Courts consist of six Yin and six Yang, totaling thirty-six Yin. There are twelve channels and fifteen network vessels, for a total of twenty-seven qi, both above and below. The source is a well, the conduit is a river, the insertion is a point, the channel is a course, the entry is a confluence, and all twenty-seven qi travel along the five points.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation: Yellow Emperor inquired about the origin of Five Organs and Six Courts. Qi Bo explained that Five Organs have 5 Yin and 5 Yang, totaling 25 Yin; similarly, Six Courts consist of 6 Yin and 6 Yang making up 36 Yin. There are twelve channels (jing) and fifteen network vessels (jing jiao), making a total of 27 qi present both above and below. The origin is a well, the conduit is a river, the insertion point is an acupoint, the channel is a pathway, the entry or confluence is a meeting point, and all 27 qi travel along the five acupoints.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>節之交，三百六十五會，知其要者，一言而終，不知其要，流散無窮。所言節者，神氣之所遊行出入也。非皮肉筋骨也。
At the point of juncture, there are 365 meetings. Those who know its essence can accomplish it with a single word; those who do not know its essence scatter without end. The juncture mentioned refers to the flow of spiritual energy coming in and out. It is not skin, flesh, sinew, or bone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>觀其色，察其目，知其散復。一其形，聽其動靜，知其邪正，右主推之，左持而御之，氣至而去之。
Observe its color, examine its eyes, understand its opening and closing. One its shape, listen to its movement and stillness, understand its evil and righteous, then guide it by the right hand and hold it with the left hand, control it when the Qi arrives and remove it when it departs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡將用鍼，必先診脈，視氣之劇易，乃可以治也。五藏之氣，已絕於內，而用鍼者反實其外，是謂重竭。重竭必死，其死也靜。治之者輒反其氣，取腋與膺。五藏之氣，已絕於外，而用鍼者反實其內，是謂逆厥。逆厥則必死，其死也躁。治之者反取四末。
In all cases where acupuncture is to be employed, the pulse must first be taken and the breathing observed. For acute cases it is especially effective. The vital energy of the Five Organs has already accumulated within and the one who uses acupuncture acts to disperse it outside - this is called overstraining. Overstraining always leads to death, and its death is quiet. To treat such a case, one must reverse the direction of the energy and take the pulse at the armpit and chest. The vital energy of the Five Organs has already accumulated outside, and the one who uses acupuncture acts to disperse it within - this is called inverted Qi. Inverted Qi always leads to death, and its death is agitated. To treat such a case, one must reverse the direction of the energy and take the pulse at the four extremities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>刺之害中而不去，則精泄；害中而去，則致氣。精泄則病益甚而恇，致氣則生為癰瘍。
Continuing to endure an irritation will deplete one's vitality, while removing the cause of irritation will lead to qi being retained. When vitality is depleted, disease worsens and manifest as wasting away; when qi is retained, it leads to the formation of growths or lesions</p>

<p>五藏有六府，六府有十二原，十二原出於四關，四關主治五藏。五藏有疾，當取之十二原。十二原者，五藏之所以稟三百六十五節氣味也。五藏有疾也，應出十二原。十1二原各有所出。明知其原，睹其應，而知五藏之害矣。陽中之少陰，肺也，其原出於太淵，太淵二。陽中之太陽，心也，其原出於大陵，大陵二。陰中之少陽，肝也，其原出於太沖，太沖二。陰中之至陰，脾也，其原出於太白，太白二。陰中之太陰，腎也，其原出於太溪，太溪二。膏之原，出於鳩尾，鳩尾一。肓之原，出於脖胦，脖胦一。凡此十二原者，主治五藏六府之有疾者也。1. 十 : 舊脫。
The Five Organs have Six Palaces, and the Six Palaces have Twelve Fundamentals. The Twelve Fundamentals originate from Four Gates, and the Four Gates govern the Five Organs. If there is a disorder in the Five Organs, they should be treated with the Twelve Fundamentals. The Twelve Fundamentals are what establish the flavors of the 365 nodes of Qi in the Five Organs. If there is a disorder in the Five Organs, it should be addressed through the Twelve Fundamentals. Each of the Twelve Fundamentals has its own origin. Knowing their origins and understanding their applicability allows for the identification of disorders in the Five Organs.</p>

<p>In the Yang phase, there is a deficiency of Shao Yin (Lesser Yin), which corresponds to the Lung. Its origin is from the Taiyuan well (Yuan 2). In the Yang phase, there is Taiyang (Great Yang), which corresponds to the Heart. Its origin is from the Dadiang mound (Dang 2). In the Yin phase, there is a deficiency of Shao Yang (Lesser Yang), which corresponds to the Liver. Its origin is from the Taixi well (Xi 2). In the Yin phase, there is the extreme Yin, which corresponds to the Spleen. Its origin is from the Taibai well (Bai 2). In the Yin phase, there is Taiyin (Great Yin), which corresponds to the Kidney. Its origin is from the Taizi stream (Zi 2). The origin of the Essence is from the tail feather, and the origin of the Tendon is from the neck joint. All of these twelve origins are responsible for treating disorders in the Five Organs' six palaces.</p>

<p>脹取三陽，飧泄取三陰。
Take three Yang, let out three Yin.</p>

<p>今夫五藏之有疾也，譬猶刺也，猶污也，猶結也，猶閉也。刺雖久猶可拔也，污雖久猶可雪也，結雖久猶可解也，閉雖久猶可決也。或言久疾之不可取者，非其說也。夫善用鍼者，取其疾也，猶拔刺也，猶雪污也，猶解結也，猶決閉也。疾雖久，猶可畢也。言不可治者，未得其術也。
If the five viscera are in a hurry, it is like being pricked, dirty, tangled, closed. Even if the prick lasts long, it can be removed; even if the dirt lasts long, it can be cleaned; even if the tangle lasts long, it can be untangled; even if the closure lasts long, it can be resolved. Those who say that a long-lasting hurry cannot be cured are not speaking correctly. The one who skillfully uses the lancet will catch its hurry, just as removing the prick, cleaning the dirt, untangling the tangle, resolving the closure. Even if the hurry lasts long, it can still be terminated. To say that it cannot be treated is because the method has not been found yet.</p>

<p>刺諸熱者，如以手探湯；刺寒清者，如人不欲行。陰有陽疾者，取之下陵三里，正往無殆，氣下乃止，不下復始也。疾高而內者，取之陰之陵泉；疾高而外者，取之陽之陵泉也。
For the hot and inflamed, it is like touching a pot of boiling water; for the cold and clear, it is like someone not wanting to move. In cases where yang is urgent, take three li below the navel, regulate as it approaches satiation, the qi will stop, and there will be no recurrence. For the urgency that is high inside, take from the kidney yin spring; for the urgency that is high outside, take from the yang yin spring.</p>
