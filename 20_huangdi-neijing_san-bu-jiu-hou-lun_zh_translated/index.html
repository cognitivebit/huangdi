<h1 id="_1">三部九候論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：余聞九鍼於夫子，眾多博大，不可勝數。余願聞要道，以屬子孫，傳之後世，著之骨髓，藏之肝肺，歃血而受，不敢妄泄，令合天道，必有終始，上應天光星辰歷紀，下副四時五行，貴賤更互，冬陰夏陽，以人應之奈何，願聞其方。歧伯對曰：妙乎哉問也！此天地之至數。帝曰：願聞天地之至數，合於人形，血氣通，決死生，為之奈何。歧伯曰：天地之至數，始於一，終於九焉。一者天，二者地，三者人，因而三之，三三者九，以應九野。故人有三部，部有三候，以決死生，以處百病，以調虛實，而除邪疾。
Emperor asked: I have heard that the Nine Needles from Confucius are abundant and vast, impossible to count. I wish to hear about the true method, which belongs to Father and Son, passed down to future generations, embedded in bone marrow, hidden in liver and lungs, drained of blood and endured, not daring to reveal frivolously, connecting with the celestial principle, there must be an ultimate beginning, above following the light of heaven, stars, and constellations recording history, below assisting the four seasons and five elements, nobility and lowliness alternating, winter as yin and summer as yang, how should people respond to this? The Duke answered: What a profound question! This concerns the ultimate number of heaven and earth. Emperor asked: I wish to hear about the ultimate number of heaven and earth, connecting with human form, blood and qi circulating, determining life and death, how should it be done? The Duke said: The ultimate number of heaven and earth begins with one and ends with nine. One is heaven, two is earth, three is humanity, thus leading to three, and the three threes become nine, in response to the nine wildernesses. Therefore, humans have three parts, each part has three stages, determining life and death, treating a hundred diseases, adjusting between emptiness and reality, and eliminating deviant illnesses.</p>
<p>2: 帝曰：何謂三部。歧伯曰：有下部，有中部，有上部，部各有三候，三候者，有天有地有人也，必指而導之，乃以為真。上部天，兩額之動脈；上部地，兩額之動脈；上部人，耳前之動脈。中部天，手太陰也；中部地，手陽明也；中部人，手少陰也。下部天，足厥陰也；下部地，足少陰也；下部人，足太陰也。故下部之天以候肝，地以候腎，人以候脾胃之氣。帝曰：中部之候奈何。歧伯曰：亦有天，亦有地，亦有人。天以候肺，地以候胸中之氣，人以候心。帝曰：上部以何候之。歧伯曰：亦有天，亦有地，亦有人，天以候頭角之氣，地以候口齒之氣，人以候耳目之氣。三部者，各有天，各有地，各有人。三而成天，三而成地，三而成人，三而三之，合則為九，九分為九野，九野為九藏。故神藏五，形藏四，合為九藏。五藏已敗，其色必夭，夭必死矣。帝曰：以候奈何。歧伯曰：必先度其形之肥瘦，以調其氣之虛實，實則寫之，虛則補之。必先去其血脈而後調之，無問其病，以平為期。
The sovereign asked, What is meant by the Three Departments? The Duke of Shou replied, There are lower, middle, and upper departments. In each department, there are three candidates: heaven, earth, and man. These are led and guided accordingly, thereby considered to be true. </p>
<p>The upper department of heaven corresponds to the greater yin, the governing vessel; the upper department of earth corresponds to the greater yang, the conception vessel; and the upper department of man corresponds to the yin channel of the face. </p>
<p>The middle department of heaven corresponds to the hand Taiyin (medial), the lung; the middle department of earth corresponds to the hand Yangming (bright), the heart; and the middle department of man corresponds to the hand Shaoyin (lesser yin), the spleen and stomach. </p>
<p>The lower department of heaven corresponds to the foot Wei (towards the sun) and corresponds to the candidate bladder; the lower department of earth corresponds to the foot Shaoyang (lesser yang), the kidneys; and the lower department of man corresponds to the foot Taiyang (greater yang), the gallbladder. </p>
<p>Thus, the lower department of heaven governs the liver through the candidate, the lower department of earth governs the kidneys through the candidate, and the lower department of man governs the spleen and stomach through the candidate. </p>
<p>The sovereign asked, How about the middle department? The Duke of Shou replied, There are also heaven, earth, and man. Heaven corresponds to the candidate lung, earth corresponds to the chest qi, and man corresponds to the heart. </p>
<p>The sovereign asked, What candidates are there for the upper department? The Duke of Shou replied, There are also heaven, earth, and man. Heaven corresponds to the head yang channel, earth corresponds to the mouth and teeth channel, and man corresponds to the eye-ear channel. </p>
<p>The Three Departments each have their own heaven, earth, and man. Three make one heaven, three make one earth, three make one man, three threes become nine, which are divided into nine orifices, and the nine orifices house the nine storage areas. Therefore, the spiritual storage areas combine to form the nine storage areas. When the five storage areas have been defeated, their colors will wither, leading to death. </p>
<p>The sovereign asked, What is the prognosis? The Duke of Shou replied, First, one must adjust the patient's body weight and regulate their qi, whether it is deficient or excessive. One must first eliminate the blood vessels before regulating, without inquiring about the disease, with restoration as the goal.</p>
<p>3: 帝曰：決死生奈何。歧伯曰：形盛脈細，少氣不足以息者，危。形瘦脈大，胸中多氣者，死。形氣相得者，生。參伍不調者，病。三部九候皆相失者，死。上下左右之脈相應如參舂者，病甚。上下左右相失不可數者，死。中部之候雖獨調，與眾藏相失者，死。中部之候相減者，死。目內陷者死。帝曰：何以知病之所在。歧伯曰：察九候獨小者，病，獨大者，病，獨疾者，病，獨遲者，病，獨熱者，病，獨寒者，病，獨陷下者，病。以左手足上，上去踝五寸按之，庶右手足當踝而彈之，其應過五寸以上，蠕蠕然者，不病；其應疾，中手渾渾然者，病；中手徐徐然者，病；其應上不能至五寸，彈之不應者，死。是以脫肉身不去者，死。中部乍踈乍數者，死。其脈代而鉤者，病在絡脈。九候之相應也，上下若一，不得相失。一候後則病，二候後則病甚，三候後則病危。所謂後者，應不俱也。察其府藏，以知死生之期。
Emporer said: What shall be done in case of certain death? 
Huang Di replied: If the body is robust but the pulse is weak, thin, and there is not enough qi to breathe, it's dangerous. If the body is emaciated, the pulse is strong and the chest is full of qi, it will lead to death. If the body and pulse are in balance, it will live. If the qi and the blood are not harmonious, it will be sick. If all three zang organs, nine shu organs fail, it will lead to death. If the qi and blood of all four limbs are harmonized like needles grinding against each other, it's serious. If the qi and blood of the body are completely lost, it will lead to death. If the zang organs in the middle are alone well balanced but fail to connect with other organs, it will lead to death. If the zang organs in the middle are alone weakened, it will lead to death. If the eyes sink, it leads to death. Emporer asked: How do you know where the disease is located? 
Huang Di replied: Check the nine orifices, if there's something alone that's too small, it's sick. If it's alone and too large, it's sick. If it's alone and moving quickly, it's sick. If it's alone and moving slowly, it's sick. If it's alone and hot, it's sick. If it's alone and cold, it's sick. If it's alone and sunken below, it's sick. Press with the left hand above the ankle, go five inches down, then press with the right hand above the ankle and pluck, if it reaches over five inches and is wriggling, it's not sick. If it's too quick, the middle pulse is full of qi, it's sick. If the middle pulse is slow, it's sick. If it can't reach above five inches, plucking isn't right, it's dead. Therefore, peeling off the flesh will not lead to death. If there are irregularities in the middle, it's dead. If the pulse stops and forms a knot, the disease is in the vessels. The nine orifices should be harmonious, up and down should not fail. If one of them is late, it leads to sickness. If two of them are late, it leads to serious sickness. If three of them are late, it leads to life-threatening illness. To refer to being late means that the pulse isn't all complete. Examine its storehouse, and know its time for life or death</p>
<p>4: 必先知經脈，然後知病脈，真藏脈見者，勝死。足太陽氣絕者，其足不可屈伸，死必戴眼。帝曰：冬陰夏陽奈何。歧伯曰：九候之脈，皆沈細懸絕者為陰，主冬，故以夜半死。盛躁喘數者為陽，主夏，故以日中死。是故寒熱病者，以平旦死。熱中及熱病者，以日中死。病風者，以日夕死。病水者，以夜半死。其脈乍踈乍數乍遲乍疾者，日乘四季死。形肉已脫，九候雖調，猶死。七診雖見，九候皆從者不死。所言不死者，風氣之病，及經月之病，似七診之病，而非也，故言不死。若有七診之病，其脈候亦敗者，死矣，必發噦噫。必審問其所始病，與今之所方病，而後各切循其脈，視其經絡浮沈，以上下逆從循之，其脈疾者不病，其脈遲者病，脈不往來者，死，皮膚著者，死。
One must first know the channels and then know the pulse. One who can see the hidden channel is victorious over death. If the foot Yang Qi is blocked, the foot cannot be bent or stretched, and death will come with the eyes popping out. The Emperor asked about yin and yang in summer and winter. Taoist master Guan Ping said: The nine signs of the pulse are all deep, thin, and suspended when they are blocked, so yin dominates winter and causes death at midnight. The agitated, panting, and hot people are yang and dominate summer, causing death at noon. Therefore, cold and hot diseases are treated with dawn, hot diseases and fever are treated with noon, diseases caused by wind are treated with dusk, diseases caused by fluids are treated with midnight. The pulse is sometimes intermittent, sometimes continuous, sometimes slow, or fast. People who have these pulses will die in the four seasons. Even after the body has shed its form and flesh, if the nine signs are properly adjusted, it will still result in death. If the seven examinations are seen, but the nine signs do not follow this, they will not die. The one who speaks of not dying refers to diseases caused by wind and uterine bleeding, which resemble diseases treated by the seven examinations, but are not the same. Therefore, it is said that if there is a disease treated by the seven examinations and the nine signs have been ruined, death will certainly occur and there will be groans of anguish. One must carefully investigate the beginning of the illness and the current state of the disease, then cut according to the pulse, observe the flow and sinking of the channels, follow their rise and fall, up and down, in and out. The fast pulse is not sick, the slow pulse is sick, the pulse that does not come and go is dead, and the skin covered with blisters is dead.</p>
<p>5: 帝曰：其可治者奈何。歧伯曰：經病者治其經，孫絡病者治其孫絡血，血病身有痛者，治其經絡。其病者在奇邪，奇邪之脈則繆刺之。留瘦不移，節而刺之。上實下虛，切而從之，索其結絡脈，刺出其血，以見通之。瞳子高者，太陽不足，戴眼者，太陽已絕，此決死生之要，不可不察也。手指及手外踝上五指，留鍼。
The emperor asked, What of one who can be governed? Zhòu Bó replied, One with illnesses of the meridians should be treated according to their meridians. One with bleeding in the sinews should be treated according to the bleeding in the sinews. For one whose body is afflicted by pain due to bleeding, treat them according to their meridians and sinews. For those who are ill in strange and abnormal ways, the strange and abnormal meridian shall be punctured. Leave the needle in place without moving it, adjust it as needed, insert the needle deeply, follow the meridian and sinew to find where they have knotted and are blocked, extract the blood by puncturing, and observe the pathway. For those with eyes that are sunken, this indicates insufficiency of the Yángqì, and for one who wears eyeglasses, the Yángqì has already ceased, which is decisive of life and death and cannot be overlooked. Among the fingers and the outer corner of the foot, insert five needles and leave them in place.</p>
