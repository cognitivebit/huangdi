<h1 id="_1">歲露論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問於歧伯曰：經言夏日傷暑，秋病瘧，瘧之發以時，其故何也？歧伯對曰：邪客於風府，病循膂而下，衛氣一日一夜，常大會於風府，其明日日下一節，故其日作晏，此其先客於脊背也。故每至於風府則腠理開，腠理開則邪氣入，邪氣入則病作，此所以日作尚晏也。衛氣之行風府，日下一節，二十一日下至尾底，二十二日入脊內，注于伏沖之脈，其行九日，出於缺盆之中，其氣上行，故其病稍益至。其內搏於五藏，橫連募原，其道遠，其氣深，其行遲，不能日作，故次日乃蓄積而作焉。
The Yellow Emperor asked Yu Qi: According to the classics, what is the cause of summer heat exhaustion and autumn illness? Yu Qi replied: Evil qi resides in the lung palace, and the illness descends following a persistent fever. The guardian qi disperses day and night, constantly gathering at the lung palace, and when it reaches the next degree, the day is made stagnant. This indicates that the evil qi has first lodged in the lumbar region. Whenever it arrives at the lung palace, the network vessels open up, allowing evil qi to enter. As a result, the illness worsens, which explains why the day becomes more stagnant. The guardian qi moves within the lung palace, reaching the next degree after 21 days and entering the lumbar region on the 22nd day, merging with the Chong Mai, and its energy ascends for nine days, exiting from the Ren Mai. Thus, the illness worsens further. The energy then accumulates within the five organs, spreading horizontally across the source field, but its path is distant, its qi is deep, its movement is slow, and it cannot become stagnant on a daily basis. Consequently, the following day, it collects itself before manifesting as an illness.</p>
<p>2: 黃帝曰：衛氣每至於風府，腠理乃發，發則邪入焉。其衛氣日下一節，則不當風府，奈何？歧伯曰：風府無常，衛氣之所應，必開其腠理，氣之所舍節，則其府也。
Yellow Emperor said: When the vital energy reaches the palace of the lungs, the orifices of the brain will open, and if they open, evil will enter. If the vital energy is deficient after a day, should it not reach the palace of the lungs? The Duke of Chou replied: The palace of the lungs is not always open; where the vital energy should be received, one must open the orifices of the brain and where the vital energy leaves its station, that is the palace.</p>
<p>3: 黃帝曰：善。夫風之與瘧也，相與同類，而風常在，而瘧特以時休，何也？歧伯曰：風氣留其處，瘧氣隨經絡，沉以內搏，故衛氣應，乃作也。帝曰：善。
Emperor Yellow said: Good. The wind and plague are of the same category, yet the wind is always present while the plague rests at specific times. Why is this so? The Duke said: The wind energy stays in a place, whereas the plague energy follows the meridians and channels, sinking inside to struggle, thus causing the defensive energy to respond accordingly. This is why it happens. Emperor Yellow said: Good.</p>
<p>4: 黃帝問於少師曰：余聞四時八風之中人也，故有寒暑，寒則皮膚急而腠理閉；暑則皮膚緩而腠理開。賊風邪氣，因得以入乎？將必須八正虛邪，乃能傷人乎？少師答曰：不然。賊風邪氣之中人也，不得以時，然必因其開也，其入深，其內極病，其病人也，卒暴。因其閉也，其入淺以留，其病也，徐以遲。
Yellow Emperor asked Laozi, saying: I have heard that people who live in the four seasons and eight winds, so there are cold and heat. When it is cold, the skin becomes tense and the orifices close; when it is hot, the skin becomes slack and the orifices open. Can the thief wind pathogenic factor enter through this? Must the eight regular and empty pathogens be able to harm people? Laozi replied, Not so. The thief wind pathogenic factor is a person who lives in the four seasons and eight winds, not according to time, but must open it, it enters deep, its internal is extremely sick, sick people die suddenly. If it closes, it enters shallowly and stays, it becomes sick.</p>
<p>5: 黃帝曰：有寒溫和適，腠理不開，然有卒病者，其故何也？少師答曰：帝弗知邪入乎。雖平居其腠理開閉緩急，其故常有時也。黃帝曰：可得聞乎？少師曰：人與天地相參也，與日月相應也。故月滿則海水西盛，人血氣積，肌肉充，皮膚致，毛髮堅，腠理郗，煙垢著，當是之時，雖遇賊風，其入淺不深。至其月郭空，則海水東盛，人氣血虛，其衛氣去，形獨居，肌肉減，皮膚縱，腠理開，毛髮殘，膠理薄，煙垢落，當是之時，遇賊風則其入深，其病人也，卒暴。
Yellow Emperor said: There is cold, heat, and appropriate balance. The channels do not open, but there are those who contract illnesses; why does this happen? Minister of Health replied: Your Majesty does not know the evil entering [the body]. Even if one's channels maintain a balance between opening and closing, it can still occur at certain times. Yellow Emperor said: Is this understandable? Minister of Health said: Human beings correspond with heaven and earth, and respond to the sun and moon. Thus when the moon is full, sea water flows towards the west, causing human blood and Qi to accumulate, muscles to fill, skin to form, pores to appear, hair to strengthen, and vessels to close, dust and dirt adhere; this is a time when foreign pathogens do not easily penetrate deeply. When the lunar mansion empties, sea water flows towards the east, human Qi and blood are depleted, guardian Qi retreats, one's form stands alone, muscles weaken, skin wrinkles, channels open, hair becomes sparse, vessel strength diminishes, dust and dirt fall away; this is a time when foreign pathogens can easily penetrate deeply. In such cases, the illness becomes severe and could be fatal.</p>
<p>6: 黃帝曰：其有卒然暴死暴病者，何也？少師答曰：三虛者，其死暴疾也；得三實者邪不能傷人也。黃帝曰：願聞三虛。少師曰：乘年之衰，逢月之空，失時之和，因為賊風所傷，是謂三虛。故論不知三虛，工反為麤。帝曰：願聞三實。少師曰：逢年之盛，遇月之滿，得時之和，雖有賊風邪氣，不能危之也。黃帝曰：善乎哉論！明乎哉道！請藏之金匱，命曰三實。然，此一夫之論也。
Yellow Emperor asked, What about those who die suddenly or suffer from serious illness? What is the cause? The Master said, It is due to the three deficiencies. Those who die of sudden illness have all three deficiencies; those who are in possession of the three realities will not be harmed by evil qi. Yellow Emperor said, I would like to hear about the three deficiencies. The Master said, Riding the decline of one's years, encountering the empty moon, missing the harmony of time, and being injured by the thief wind, this is called the three deficiencies. Therefore, those who do not understand the three deficiencies cannot be skilled in their practice. Yellow Emperor said, I would like to hear about the three realities. The Master said, Riding the fullness of one's years, encountering the full moon, obtaining the harmony of time, even with the presence of thief wind qi, they cannot endanger others. Yellow Emperor exclaimed, How marvelous is this doctrine! Please engrave this on a gold inlay and call it the Three Realities. However, this is just one man's discourse.</p>
<p>7: 黃帝曰：願聞歲之所以皆同病者，何因而然？少師曰：此八正之候也。黃帝曰：候之奈何？少師曰：候此者，常以冬至之日，太一立於葉蟄之宮，其至也，天必應之以風雨者矣。風雨從南方來者，為虛風，賊傷人者也。其以夜半至也，萬民皆臥而弗犯也，故其歲民少病。其以晝至者，萬民懈惰而皆中於虛風，故萬民多病。虛邪入客於骨而不發於外，至其立春，陽氣大發，腠理開，因立春之日，風從西方來，萬民又皆中於虛風，此兩邪相搏，經氣結代者矣。故諸逢其風而遇其雨者，命曰遇歲露焉，因歲之和，而少賊風者，民少病而少死。歲多賊風邪氣，寒溫不和，則民多病而死矣。
Yellow Emperor: I wish to hear about why all people suffer from the same disease at different times of the year. Younger Master said: This is a matter of the Eight Regularities. Yellow Emperor: What can be done about it? Younger Master: When this occurs, one must always wait until the winter solstice. The Great Ultimate will be established in the Palace of Insects on that day; Heaven will necessarily respond with wind and rain. Wind and rain coming from the south are empty winds that harm people. They arrive at midnight when all the myriad people are asleep and not harmed. When they arrive during the day, the myriad people are idle and all come into contact with empty winds, so the myriad people get sick. Empty evil enters the bones without manifesting externally and does not emerge until the beginning of spring, when yang qi is released in great quantity and the orifices open according to the day of the beginning of spring. Wind comes from the west at that time, and the myriad people again come into contact with empty winds; these two evils contend, causing the vital energy to accumulate and stagnate. Therefore, whenever one encounters wind and rain together, it is called an encounter with seasonal dew. Based on the harmony of the season, one can avoid evil winds. The people will have fewer diseases and fewer deaths. Many diseases are caused by evil winds, cold and warmth not being harmonious; then the myriad people suffer and die.</p>
<p>8: 黃帝曰：虛邪之風，其所傷貴賤何如，候之奈何？少師答曰：正月朔日，太一居天留之宮，其日西北風，不雨，人多死矣。正月朔日，平旦北風，春，民多死。正月朔日，平旦北風行，民病多者，十有三也。正月朔日，日中北風，夏，民多死。正月朔日，夕時北風，秋，民多死。終日北風，大病死者十有六。正月朔日，風從南方來，命曰旱鄉；從西方來，命曰白骨，將國有殃，人多死亡。正月朔日，風從東方來，發屋，揚沙石，國有大災也。正月朔日，風從東南方行，春有死亡。正月朔日1，天利溫不風糶賤，民不病；天寒而風，糶貴，民多病。此所謂候歲之風，殘傷人者也。二月丑不風，民多心腹病；三月戌不溫，民多寒熱；四月已不暑，民多癉病；十月申不寒，民多暴死。諸所謂風者，皆發屋，折樹木，揚沙石起毫毛，發腠理者也。1. 日 : 舊脫。
Emperor Yellow said: How does the wind of deficiency and evil harm nobles and commoners, and what about it? The disciple answered: In the winter solstice, when the Great Ultimate resides in heaven and leaves its palace, on the day of west north wind, no rain, many people die. On the winter solstice, on the morning of north wind, spring comes, and many people die. On the winter solstice, on the morning of north wind, walking, there are many sick people, one in three. In the winter solstice, at noon north wind, summer arrives, and many people die. In the winter solstice, at dusk north wind, autumn comes, and many people die. Throughout the day, north wind, six in ten will be dead. On the winter solstice, the wind comes from the south, called drought village; coming from the west, called white bones, the country is in peril, and many people die. On the winter solstice, the wind comes from the east, raises dust, sand, and stones, causing a great disaster for the country. On the winter solstice, the wind comes from the southeast, spring has deaths. On the winter solstice, the first day, heaven is warm without wind, and there are no diseases among the people; when cold and windy, it is stingy, and many people get sick. This is called waiting for the weather in a year and hurting people. In the second month, no wind, many people suffer from heart and abdomen diseases; in the third month, no heat, many people have cold and fever; in the fourth month, no heat, many people have scabies; in the tenth month, no cold, many people die violently. All so-called winds blow houses, break trees, raise sand, stones, raising every hair on their heads. 1. Day: Peeled off.</p>
