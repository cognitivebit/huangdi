<h1 id="_1">刺法論</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：升降不前，氣交有變，即成暴鬱，余已知之。如何預救生靈，可得卻乎？歧伯稽首再拜對曰：昭乎哉問！臣聞夫子言，既明天元，須窮法刺，可以折鬱扶運，補弱全真，盛蠲餘，令除斯苦。帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯曰：升之不前，即有甚凶也。木欲升而天柱窒抑之，木欲發鬱亦須待時，當刺足厥陰之井。火欲升而天蓬窒抑之，火欲發鬱亦須待時，君火相火同刺包絡之滎。土欲升而天衝窒抑之，土欲發鬱亦須待時，當刺足太陰之俞。金欲升而天英窒抑之，金欲發鬱亦須時，當刺手太陰之經。水欲升而天內窒抑之，水欲發鬱亦須待時，當刺足少陰之合。
Yellow Emperor asked: When there is no rise or fall, the circulation of Qi has changed and becomes wild chaos. I already know this. How can one prevent and treat life spirit? What can be obtained from it? Duke of Zhou knelt down and offered worship again, answering, Excellent question! I have heard that Master said, when Heaven's vitality is clear, one must exhaustively explore the needles, able to break through chaos, support yang qi, strengthen the gate, and eliminate the remainder, eliminating this suffering. The Emperor said: Please quickly explain it to me. Duke of Zhou answered: When there is no rise, it is indeed ominous. Wood intends to rise but heavenly pillar suppresses it; wood also intending to release chaos needs time, at the jinmen intersection. Fire intends to rise but heavenly net suppresses it; fire also intending to release chaos needs time, strike fire and fire same strike bag of skin. Earth intends to rise but heavenly rampart suppresses it; earth also intending to release chaos needs time, at the jinmen intersection. Gold intends to rise but heavenly emblem suppresses it; gold also intending to release chaos needs time, strike hand jinmen intersection. Water intends to rise but heavenly interior suppresses it; water also intending to release chaos needs time, at the jinmen intersection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：升之不前，可以預備，願聞其降，可以先防。歧伯曰：既明其升，必達其降也。升降之道，皆可先治也。木欲降而地皛窒抑之，降而不入，抑之鬱發，散而可得位，降而鬱發，暴如天閒之待時也，降而不下，鬱可速矣，降可折其所勝也，當刺手太陰之所出，刺手陽明之所入。火欲降而地玄窒抑之，降而不入，抑之鬱發，散而可矣，當折其所勝，可散其鬱，當刺足少陰之所出，刺足太陽之所入。土欲降而地蒼窒抑之，降而不下，抑之鬱發，散而可入，當折其勝，可散其鬱，當刺足厥陰之所出，刺足少陽之所入。金欲降而地彤窒抑之，降而不下，散抑之鬱發，散而可入，當折其勝，可散其鬱，當刺心包胳所出，刺手少陽所入也。水欲降而地阜窒抑之，降而不下，抑之鬱發，散而可入，當折其土，可散其鬱，當刺足太陰之所出，刺足陽明之所入。
Emperor: If the rising does not come forward, it can be prepared for; I wish to hear of its descent, so that there can be early defense. Obstinate says: Once the ascending is made clear, it must reach the descending. The method of ascending and descending can be regulated beforehand. Wood wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, scatters it so that it may obtain a position, when it descends and binds and releases it, it is as if waiting for its time; when it descends but does not enter, it can be quickly done. It can defeat what it has overcome, and should pierce the hand at where Yang Ming enters, and at where Taiyin issues forth. Fire wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, and it can scatter when it is scattered, it should defeat what it has overcome, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where Shao Yin issues forth and where Taiyang enters. Earth wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, and scatters when it can enter, it should defeat its victory, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where Shao Yang issues forth and where Taiyang enters. Gold wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it scatters its binding and releases it, and when it is scattered, it can enter, it should defeat what it has overcome, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where the Heart Protector and Biceps issue forth and at where Shao Yang enters. Water wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, and scatters when it can enter, it should defeat its soil, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where Taiyin issues forth and where Yang Ming enters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：五運之至，有前後與升降往來，有所承抑之，可得聞乎？刺法歧伯曰：當取其化源也。是故太過取之，不及資之。太過取之，次抑其鬱，取其運之化源，令折鬱氣。不及扶資，以扶運氣，以避虛邪也。資取之法令出《密語》。
The Emperor asked: When the Five Phases are at their peak, there is a movement of ascending and descending, front and back, and there is something that restrains them. Can you hear about it? The Master of Needle and Thread replied: You must take hold of its source. Thus, if you overdo it, you do not benefit the resource. Overdoing it, you suppress the yin, taking hold of the phase's source, and cause the yin qi to contract. Not benefiting the support of resources, you use this to support the phase qi and ward off empty evil. The methods for taking hold of resources are found in the Secret Speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：升降之刺，以知要，願聞司天未得遷正，使司化之失其常政，即萬化之或其皆妄。然與民為病，可得先除，欲濟群生，願聞其說。歧伯稽首再拜曰：悉乎哉問！言其至理，聖念慈憫，欲濟群生，臣乃盡陳斯道，可申洞微。太陽復布，即厥陰不遷正，不遷正氣塞於上，當寫足厥陰之所流。厥陰復布，少陰不遷正，不遷正即氣塞於上，當刺心包胳脈之所流。少陰復布，太陰不遷正，不遷正即氣留於上，當刺足太陰之所流。太陰復布，少陽不遷正，不遷正則氣塞未通，當刺手少陽之所流。少陽復布，則陽明不遷正，不遷正則氣未通上，當刺手太陰之所流。陽明復布，太陽不遷正，不遷正則復塞其氣，當刺足少陰之所流。
Yellow Emperor asked, The needling of the ascending and descending vessels can discern the location of the disease. I wish to hear from the Grand Master Shu: what is the method for correcting the anomalies in the Celestial Office and guiding the transformations? It appears that if one mistakenly treats the multitude as patients, then the illness can be easily removed. Desiring to aid all living beings, I wish to hear your explanation. Grand Master Shu bowed and paid his respects again and said, I understand your question very well. Your words are most profound, demonstrating the sagely compassion and benevolence you have for all living beings. I can only humbly explain this method, which may apply to subtle points. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When the Yang energy is ascending and the Yin energy is not descending properly, the Qi will accumulate in the upper part of the body, causing difficulties with the foot-Yin channels where the Qi flows.</p>
<p>When the Yin energy is ascending and the Yang energy is not descending properly, the Qi will accumulate in the heart, lung, and arm-Yang channels where the Qi flows.</p>
<p>When the Yin energy is ascending and the Yang energy is not descending properly, the Qi will accumulate in the kidneys and cause problems with the foot-Yang channels where the Qi flows.</p>
<p>When the Yang energy is ascending and the Yin energy is not descending properly, the Qi will accumulate in the hands and arm-Yang channels where the Qi flows.</p>
<p>When the Yin energy is ascending and the Yang energy is not descending properly, the Qi will accumulate in the heart, lung, and hand-Yang channels where the Qi flows.</p>
<p>When the Yang energy is ascending and the Yin energy is not descending properly, the Qi will accumulate in the foot-Yang channels where the Qi flows.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>帝曰：遷正不前，以通其要，願聞不退，欲折其餘，無令過失，可得明乎？歧伯曰：氣過有餘，復作布正，是名不過位也。使地氣不得後化，新司天未可遷正，故復布化令如故也。巳亥之歲天數有餘，故厥陰不退位也，風行於上，木化布天，當刺足厥陰之所入。子午之歲，天數有餘，故少陰不退位也，熱行於上，火餘化布天，當刺手厥陰之所入。丑未之歲，天數有餘，故太陰不退位也，溼行於上，雨化布天，當刺足太陰之所入。寅申之歲，天數有餘，故少陽不退位也，熱行於上，火化布天，當刺手少陽之所入。卯酉之歲，天數有餘，故陽明不退位也，金行於上，燥化布天，當刺手太陰之所入。辰戌之歲，天數有餘，故太陽不退位也，寒行於上凜水化布天，當刺足少陰之所入。故天地氣逆，化成民病，以法刺之，預可平痾。
The Emperor said: Retreating and not returning, I want to understand its essence. Please don't retreat, I want to conquer the rest, without causing any mistakes, is it clear? Duke Bö said: When Qi exceeds, it will rebalance, which is called not overstepping boundaries. Make sure that the earthly energy does not degenerate, and the new appointment of the sky cannot be rebalanced, so I will restore the regulation as before. In a year with excess days of the Xuанzi, the Yin retreats position because it is damp above, water changes into wood, and it should be needled at the foot of the Yin's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Renzhi, the Yangui retreats position because it is hot above, fire consumes wood, and it should be needled at the hand of the Yangui's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Jiazi, the Taiyin retreats position because it is damp above, rain changes into metal, and it should be needled at the foot of the Taiyin's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Gengxi, the Shaoyang retreats position because it is hot above, fire consumes wood, and it should be needled at the hand of the Shaoyang's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Jichou, the Taiyang does not retreat position because it is cold above, ice changes into water, and it should be needled at the foot of the Shao yin's entrance. Therefore, when heavenly energy is reversed and turns into human disease, using law to needle will prevent the onset of diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：剛柔二干，失守其位，使天運之氣皆虛乎？與民為病，可得平乎？歧伯曰：深乎哉問！明其奧旨，天地迭移，三年化疫，是謂根之可見，必有逃門。
Yellow Emperor asked: The hard and the soft, if they lose their positions, will all become empty in terms of celestial influences. Can one govern the people with illness? Gongsun Long said: This is a profound question! Understanding its subtle intention, heaven and earth undergo changes every three years, causing epidemics; this can be seen as the roots, but there must be an escape route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>假令甲子，剛柔失守，剛未正，柔孤而有虧，時序不令，即音律非從，如此三年，變大疫也。詳其微甚，察其淺深，欲至而可刺，刺之，當先補腎俞，次三日，可刺足太陰之所注。又有下位己卯不至，而甲子孤立者，次三年作土癘，其法補瀉，一如甲子同法也。其刺以畢，又不須夜行及遠行，令七日潔，清淨齋戒。所有自來腎有久病者，可以寅時面向南，淨神不亂，思閉氣不息七徧，以引頸嚥氣順之，如嚥氣甚硬物，如此七徧後，餌舌下津令無數。
Assuming Jiazi, hard and soft lose balance, hard is not yet complete, while the soft is alone with deficiency, time sequence is not in order, and sound and rhythm are not according to tradition. If this lasts for three years, it will result in a great plague. Analyzing its subtlety and depth, it can be acupunctured at the point that can be pierced; then it should first supplement Qi Gong. After three days, it can acupuncture at the foot-Taiyin where it is located. There are also those who, in a submissive position of Jupiter in Mao, do not reach Jiazi alone, and in the next three years they will have a disease of the soil; its treatment is to supplement Guan. Its acupuncture is completed, and there is no need for night travel or distant travel. On the seventh day, it should be purified, clean and pure abstinence. All those who have come with old disease in their lower Qi can be treated by facing south at the time of Chongwu, cleaning their spirits to avoid chaos, holding their breath for seven breaths, guiding their necks to swallow Qi naturally, as if swallowing hard objects; after seven breaths, the saliva will make the water below abundant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>假令丙寅，剛柔失守，上剛干失守，下柔不可獨主之，中水運非太過，不可執法而定之，布天有餘，而失守上正，天地不合，即律呂音異，如此即天運失序，後三年變疫。詳其微甚，差有大小，徐至即後三年，至甚即首三年，當先補心俞，次五日，可刺腎之所入。又有下位地甲子，辛巳柔不附剛，亦名失守，即地運皆虛，後三年變水癘，即刺法皆如此矣。其刺如畢，慎其大喜欲情於中，如不忌，即其氣復散也，令靜七日，心欲實，令少思。
Assuming it is Bingchen, hard and soft fail to maintain, above hard dry fails to maintain, below soft cannot be independent, middle water does not exceed, cannot execute law and define it, there are extras in the sky, but fail to maintain the correct above, heaven and earth not matching, then the laws Luo sound is different, if so, then the celestial circulation fails order, later three years changed disease. It details very slight, difference has big and small, step by step arrive at later three years, become very then first three years, should first supplement heart Gui, next five days, can stab pancreas in the entrance. Again there is below position Jiazi, Renxu hard does not combine with soft, also named fail to maintain, then land circulation is all empty, later three years change water bubble, then stab method are all like this. Its stab like finish, beware of its great joy desire in the middle, if not avoid, its qi will scatter again, make quiet seven days, heart want real, let little think.</p>

<p>假令庚辰，剛柔失守，上位失守，下位無合，乙庚金運，故非相招，布天未退，中運勝來，上下相錯，謂之失守，姑洗林鍾，商音不應也，如此則天運化易，三年變大疫。詳其天數，差有微甚，微即微，三年至，甚即甚，三年至，當先肝俞，次三日，可刺肺之所行。刺畢，可靜神七日，慎勿大怒，怒必真氣卻散之。又或在下地甲子乙未失守者，即乙柔干，即上庚獨治之，亦名失守者，即□□孤主之，三年變癘，名曰金癘，其至待時也，詳其地數之等差，亦推其微甚，可知遲速爾。諸位乙庚失守，刺法同，肝欲平，即勿怒。
Assuming it's Geng-Chen, the yin and yang are out of balance. The superior position is out of balance, and the inferior position has no harmony. The interaction between Jia and Geng brings good fortune in gold, but since this is not mutual attraction, the heavenly cycle cannot be completed. The superior and inferior positions are out of sync, and thus can be called out of balance. A woman named Lin Zhong from Guan and a merchant from Shang have no harmony in their voices either. Then, the heavenly fortune will transform and change into a great epidemic in three years' time. In terms of the numbers involved, there is a slight discrepancy, both small and large, by the third year, and at this point, it is said that the liver will be afflicted first. After three days have passed, one can perform an acupuncture treatment on the lung meridian. When the needles are removed, one should rest and refrain from anger; being angry will cause the true qi to disperse. Alternatively, in the case of those born during the period of Bing-Shen and Ding-Wu, or when a woman named Lin Zhong is present, it can be treated by needling the yin and yang meridians using Jia's yang and Geng's yin, which are also considered out of balance. This condition is known as golden weakness, and its onset should be expected after a certain period of time. By examining the differences between the numbers involved, one can determine whether it will come quickly or slowly. In the case of those born during Jia's yin and Geng's yang phases, the advice is the same: do not get angry.</p>

<p>假令壬午，剛柔失守，上壬未遷正，下丁獨然，即雖陽年，虧及不同，上下失守，相招其有期，差之微甚，各有其數也，律呂二角，失而不和，同音有日，微甚如見，三年大疫，當刺脾之俞，次三日，可刺肝之所出也。刺畢，靜神七日，勿大醉歌樂，其氣復散，又勿飽食，勿食生物，欲令脾實，氣無滯飽，無久坐，食無太酸，無食一切生物，宜甘宜淡。又或地下甲子，丁酉失守其位，未得中司，即氣不當位，下不與壬奉合者，亦名失守，非名合德，故柔不附剛，即地運不合，三年變癘，其刺法一如木疫之法。
Assuming it is Ren Wuyin, the following literary Chinese text can be translated to English: 
If during the Yin Period of Ren, the balance between firmness and flexibility is lost, in the Xin year, this is particularly unfortunate. Above (the body) is governed by the metal element (of the Jupiter day master), below by fire (Earth day master). The loss of harmony leads to different periods where firmness and flexibility are out of balance. The principles can be likened to the concept of lu lu er jiao, whereby in order to restore balance, there must be a day of rest and one of activity, each with its own significance. Two years later (from the beginning of imbalance), the Bladder and Gallbladder meridians should be treated, followed by seven days of calm, avoiding excesses such as alcohol and rich food to allow the energy to return to normal. Foods should also be avoided that are too sour, sweet or overly stimulating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another scenario is if the Wood element (Jupiter day master) is out of balance in the year of the Rooster. If the Wood element is unable to combine with other elements due to imbalance, this is also known as being out of balance. In this situation, flexibility does not attach itself to firmness and energy will not flow properly. The body can experience discomfort for three years and the treatment should be similar to that used in treating mu (wood) disease.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>假令戊申，剛柔失守，戊癸雖火運，陽年不太過也，上失其剛，柔地獨主，其氣不正，故有邪干，迭移其位，差有淡深，欲至將合，音律先同，如此天運失時，三年之中，火疫至矣，當刺肺之俞。刺畢，靜神七日，勿大悲傷也，悲傷即肺動，而真氣復散也，人欲實肺者，要在息氣也。又或地下甲子，癸亥失守者，即柔失守位也，即上失其剛也，即亦名戊癸不相合德者也，即運與地虛，後三年變癘，即名火癘。
Suppose it is a Wuxu year, with Yin and Yang losing balance, although the Fire element runs through the Wu and Gui years, Yang's influence is not too strong. The firm aspect fails above, while the soft aspect stands alone, its energy is not correct, hence there are misfortune and disasters, changing positions and varying in depth, almost coming together, music and rhythm coincide, so when heavenly luck fails, within three years, fire will come upon us. During this time, one must pierce the lungs at the junction of the lung meridian. Afterward, remain quiet for seven days, do not be excessively sad, for sorrow disturbs the lungs and scatters true energy, those who wish to truly heal their lungs must focus on regulating breath. Alternatively, if one loses the Gui earth element in Jiazi or Gengchen years, they have lost both balance and firmness, and share the unsuitability of Wuxu years. In the following three years, there will be a dryness ailment, known as fire dryness.</p>

<p>是故立地五年，以明失守，以溼法刺，於是疫之與癘，即是上下剛柔之名也，窮歸一體也，即刺疫法，只有五法，即總其諸位失守，故只歸五行而統之也。
Therefore, establishing the land for five years, it became clear that strategy was lost through openness and tactics were pierced through moisture. Thus, disease and pestilence emerged together, signifying the names of hardness and softness, ultimately unifying into one body, thus the art of disease and pestilence lies in five methods, encompassing all the failures of strategies, which is why they are classified into the Five Phases (elements).</p>

<p>黃帝曰：余聞五疫之至，皆相染易，無問大小，病狀相似，不施救療，如何可得不相移易者？歧伯曰：不相染者，正氣存內，邪不可干，避其毒氣，天牝從來，復得其往，氣出於腦，即不邪干。氣出於腦，即室先想心如日。欲將入於疫室，先想青氣自肝而出，左行於東，化作林木。次想白氣自肺而出，右行於西，化作戈甲。次想赤氣自心而出，南行於上，化作燄明。次想黑氣自腎而出，北行於下，化作水。次想黃氣自脾而出，存於中央，化作土。五氣護身之畢，以想頭上如北斗之煌煌，然後可入於疫室。
Emperor Yellow said: I have heard that in the case of the five epidemics, when they are at their height, people easily catch and transmit them without regard for age or status. The symptoms are similar, and without proper treatment, how can one avoid transmission? Duke of Bizarre replied: Those who do not contract it have pure Qi inside, while evil cannot affect them. They avoid its toxic Qi. The Yin has been following this practice from ancient times and still continues to be followed today. When the Qi comes out of the brain, it is not evil. The Qi coming out of the brain corresponds to the mind like the sun. To enter the epidemic room, first imagine the green Qi coming out from the liver on the left and moving eastward, transforming into trees and plants. Then imagine the white Qi coming out from the lungs on the right and moving westward, transforming into armor and weapons. Then imagine the red Qi coming out of the heart and moving northwards, transforming into light. Then imagine the black Qi coming out from the kidneys and moving southwards, transforming into water. Finally, imagine the yellow Qi coming out from the spleen and staying in the center, transforming into earth. When the five Qis have protected the body, one should visualize a shining image of the North Pole on top of their head before entering the epidemic room.</p>

Another method, on the vernal equinox day, vomit before sunrise. Another method, on the rain water day after, bathe three times with medicine to sweat. Another method, small gold pill formula: two li of beichen sand, two li of shuimun xionghuang, one li of yecenzhimu, half a li of zigold, put them together in a cauldron, and make it waterproof. Build a kiln one chi high, no need for medicine, no need to refine, use fire of twenty catties to bake for seven days, wait for cooling for seven days, take out the cauldron, bury the medicine in the ground for seven days, take it out on the following day, grind it into powder for three days, refine white sand sugar into pills, like walnut size, every day facing east and taking in solar qi with one breath, taking a pill with iced water to replenish qi, taking ten pills, no more plague.</p>

<p>黃帝問曰：人虛即神游失守位，使鬼神外干，是致夭亡，何以全真？願聞刺法。歧伯稽首再拜曰：昭乎哉問！謂神移失守，雖在其體，然不致死，或有邪干，故令夭壽。只如厥陰失守，天以虛，人氣肝虛，感天重虛，即魂游於上，邪干厥大氣，身溫猶可刺之，刺其足少陽之所過，次刺肝之俞。人病心虛，又遇君相二火司天失守，感而三虛，遇火不及，黑尸鬼犯之，令人暴亡，可刺手少陽之所過，復刺心俞。人脾病，又遇太陰司天失守，感而三虛，又遇土不及，青尸鬼邪犯之於人，令人暴亡，可刺足陽明之所過，復刺脾之俞。人肺病，遇陽明司天失守，感而三虛，又遇金不及，有赤尸鬼干人，令人暴亡，可刺手陽明之所過，復刺肺俞。人腎病，又遇太陽司天失守，感而三虛，又遇水運不及之年，有黃尸鬼干犯人正氣，吸人神魂，致暴亡，可刺足太陽之所過，刺足少陽之俞。
Emperor Yellow asked: When a person is empty and their spirit wanders without restraint, causing the spirits of ghosts to intervene, leading to untimely death, how can one attain completeness? I wish to hear about acupuncture. The Duke of Tang bowed and paid homage again, saying, Your Majesty's question is indeed profound! By speaking of a spirit that wanders without restraint, although it exists within the body, it does not result in death and may involve evil influences, thus causing untimely death. Just as when Yin is out of balance, Heaven punishes with emptiness, and a person's liver and gallbladder are empty, feeling Heaven's emptiness, their soul wanders above, allowing evil influences to control the great Qi, while the body still has warmth, acupuncture can be applied at the point where the foot channel of the lesser Yang passes through, followed by needling the Liver. When a person suffers from heart disease and encounters the influence of the Fire emperor who fails to maintain balance, they feel three levels of emptiness and encounter fire that does not reach, causing black corpses and ghosts to attack, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the hand channel of the lesser Yang passes through, followed by needling the heart. A person's spleen disease, when the Taiyin function fails to maintain balance, feels three levels of emptiness and encounters earth that does not reach, causing green corpses and ghosts to attack the person violently, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the foot channel of Yang Ming passes through, followed by needling the spleen. When a person suffers from lung disease and encounters the influence of Yang Ming who fails to maintain balance, they feel three levels of emptiness, and encounter metal that does not reach, causing red corpses and ghosts to attack the person violently, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the hand channel of Yang Ming passes through, followed by needling the lung. A person's kidney disease, when the Taiyang function fails to maintain balance and encounters water that does not reach during its phase, causes yellow corpses and ghosts to attack a person's pure Qi, draining their soul, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the foot channel of Taiyang passes through, and needling the foot channel of lesser Yang</p>

<p>黃帝問曰：十二藏之相使，神失位，使神彩之不圓，恐邪干犯，治之可刺，願聞其要。歧伯稽首再拜曰：悉乎哉，問至理，道真宗，此非聖帝，焉究斯源，是謂氣神合道，契符上天。心者，君主之官，神明出焉，可刺手少陰之源。肺者，相傳之官，治節出焉，可刺手太陰之源。肝者，將軍之官，謀慮出焉，可刺足厥陰之源。膽者，中正之官，決斷出焉，可刺足少陽之源。膻中者，臣使之官，喜樂出焉，可刺心包胳所流。脾為諫議之官，知周出焉，可刺脾之源。胃為倉廩之官，五味出焉，可刺胃之源。大腸者，傳道之官，變化出焉，可刺大腸之源。小腸者，受盛之官，化物出焉，可刺小腸之源。腎者，作強之官，伎巧出焉，刺其腎之源。三焦者，決瀆之官，水道出焉，刺三焦之源。膀胱者，州都之官，精液藏焉，氣化則能出矣，刺膀胱之源。凡此十二官者，不得相失也。是故刺法有全神養真之旨，亦法有修真之道，非治疾也，故要修養和神也。道貴常存，補神固根，精氣不散，神守不分，然即神守而雖不去，亦全真，人神不守，非達至真，至真之要，在乎天玄，神守天息，復入本元，命曰歸宗。
Emperor Yellow asked: If the twelve channels are out of balance, causing the Qi and spirit to be disordered, there is a fear that evil forces will invade, and acupuncture can be used to treat it. I would like to know the essence of this method. Great Master kowtowed again and said: Indeed, your question is profound and your teaching is true. This is not about a holy emperor; how could it be so originated? It is called the harmony of Qi and spirit, corresponding with heaven's symbols. The heart is the official of the ruler, where the spirit emerges from, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the small intestine meridian. The lung is the official of transmission, where Qi regulation emerges, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the kidney meridian. The liver is the official of the general, where strategies emerge, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the liver meridian. The spleen is the official of deliberation, where discernment emerges, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the stomach meridian. The large intestine is the official of centrality, where decisions emerge, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the gallbladder meridian. The triple burner is the official of transformation, where skill emerges, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the triple burner meridian. The bladder is the official of storage, where essence accumulates, which will be able to flow out, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the bladder meridian. The twelve channels mentioned above must not lose their balance. Therefore, the principles of acupuncture have both nourishing the true Qi and cultivating the truth, not for treating illnesses; instead, it focuses on nurturing and harmonizing the spirit. Precious is this constant presence, supplementing the root of the spirit, keeping the Qi from dispersing, and keeping the spirit undivided; even if the spirit is kept intact but does not leave, it is still complete in truth, and the spirit that does not leave will return to its original source, called returning to the ancestral temple.</p>
