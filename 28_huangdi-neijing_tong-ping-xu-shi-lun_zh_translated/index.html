<h1 id="_1">通評虛實論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：何謂虛實。歧伯對曰：邪氣盛則實，精氣奪則虛。帝曰：虛實何如。歧伯曰：氣虛者肺虛也，氣逆者足寒也，非其時則生，當其時則死。餘藏皆如此。帝曰：何謂重實。歧伯曰：所謂重實者，言大熱病，氣熱脈滿，是謂重實。帝曰：經絡俱實何如，何以治之。歧伯曰：經絡皆實，是寸脈急而尺緩也，皆當治之，故曰：滑則從，濇則逆也。夫虛實者，皆從其物類始，故五藏骨肉滑利，可以長久也。帝曰：絡氣不足，經氣有餘，何如。歧伯曰：絡氣不足，經氣有餘者，脈口熱而尺寒也，秋冬為逆，春夏為從，治主病者。帝曰：經虛絡滿何如。歧伯曰：經虛絡滿者，尺熱滿脈口寒濇也，此春夏死秋冬生也。帝曰：治此者奈何。歧伯曰：絡滿經虛，灸陰刺陽；經滿絡虛，刺陰灸陽。帝曰：何謂重虛。歧伯曰：脈氣上虛尺虛，是謂重虛。帝曰：何以治之。歧伯曰：所謂氣虛者，言無常也。尺虛者，行步恇然。脈虛者，不象陰也。如此者，滑則生，濇則死也。
Emperor asked, What is the meaning of yijing (虚實)? Huanghuang replied, When qi is excessive, it is real; when qi is deficient, it is empty. The emperor then asked, What is the nature of yijing and shiyijing (實実)? Huanghuang answered, The qi is empty in the lungs, and the qi is reversed in the feet, resulting in death if it occurs at the wrong time and life if it occurs at the right time. The same applies to the remaining treasures. The emperor asked, What do you mean by zhishi (重實)? Huanghuang replied, Zhishi refers to large heat diseases, where the qi is hot and the pulse is full. When the emperor asked, How are the jingai (經臨) and the mai (絡) treated when both are full? Huanghuang answered, When the jingai and the mai are both full, it means that the qi at the guan is urgent while the qi at the cun is slack. Therefore, it should be treated, and this is why it says: 'Slippery, follow; turbid, reverse.' The emperor then asked, What happens when the qi of the jingai is insufficient and the qi of the mai has a surplus? Huanghuang replied, When the qi in the jingai is insufficient but there is an excess of qi in the mai, it means that the pulse at the guan is hot while the pulse at the cun is cold. In autumn and winter, this causes reversal, while in spring and summer, it follows. The treatment should focus on the main disease. The emperor then asked, What happens when the jingai is empty and the mai is full? Huanghuang replied, The qi in the mai is hot and the pulse at the guan is cold and turbid, meaning that spring and summer cause death while autumn and winter cause life. What should be done to treat this condition? Huanghuang answered, When the mai is full and the jingai is empty, use cupping and acupuncture; when the mai is empty and the jingai is full, use acupuncture and cupping. The emperor asked, What do you mean by chixu (重虚)? Huanghuang replied, The qi is deficient in the feet, with a weak pulse at the guan, meaning that this condition is heavy. The pulse is deficient at the cun, which means there is no yin energy. This leads to death if it occurs at an inopportune time and life if it occurs at an opportune time.</p>
<p>2: 帝曰：寒氣暴上，脈滿而實何如。歧伯曰：實而滑則生，實而逆則死。帝曰：脈實滿，手足寒，頭熱，何如。歧伯曰：春秋則生，冬夏則死。脈浮而濇，濇而身有熱者死。帝曰：其形盡滿何如。歧伯曰：其形盡滿者，脈急大堅，尺濇而不應也，如是者，故從則生，逆則死。帝曰：何謂從則生，逆則死。歧伯曰：所謂從者，手足溫也。所謂逆者，手足寒也。帝曰：乳子而病熱，脈懸小者何如。歧伯曰：手足溫則生，寒則死。帝曰：乳子中風熱，喘鳴肩息者，脈何如。歧伯曰：喘鳴肩息者，脈實大也，緩則生，急則死。帝曰：腸澼便血何如。歧伯曰：身熱則死，寒則生。帝曰：腸澼下白沫何如。歧伯曰：脈沈則生，脈浮則死。帝曰：腸澼下膿血何如。歧伯曰：脈懸絕則死，滑大則生。帝曰：腸澼之屬，身不熱，脈不懸絕何如。歧伯曰：滑大者曰生，懸濇者曰死，以藏期之。帝曰：癲疾何如。歧伯曰：脈搏大滑，久自已；脈小堅急，死不治。帝曰：癲疾之脈，虛實何如。歧伯曰：虛則可治，實則死。帝曰：消癉虛實何如。歧伯曰：脈實大，病久可治；脈懸小堅，病久不可治。
Emperor: The cold winds are strong, and the pulse is full and real. What does this mean? Grand Preceptor: If the pulse is slippery, it means life; if the pulse is reversed, it means death. Emperor: The pulse is full and tight, the hands and feet are cold, and the head is hot. What does this mean? Grand Preceptor: This refers to the signs of spring and autumn, which bring life, while those of winter and summer bring death. If the pulse is shallow and there is heat in the body, it means death. Emperor: What does it mean when the form is completely filled? Grand Preceptor: When the form is completely filled, the pulse is hurried, large, and tight, and the small yin does not respond properly. In such a case, following the proper path leads to life, while going against it leads to death. Emperor: What does it mean to follow the proper path and lead to life, and go against it and lead to death? Grand Preceptor: By following the proper path, I mean that the hands and feet are warm. By going against it, I mean that the hands and feet are cold. Emperor: When there is fever in infancy, and the pulse is suspended and small, what does this mean? Grand Preceptor: If the hands and feet are warm, it means life; if they are cold, it means death. Emperor: When there is wind-heat fever in infancy, with coughing, shortness of breath, and shoulder pain, what does the pulse look like? Grand Preceptor: Coughing, shortness of breath, and shoulder pain indicate a large and strong pulse, which may lead to life if treated gently, or to death if treated urgently. Emperor: What does it mean when there is blood in the intestines? Grand Preceptor: If the body is hot, it means death; if it is cold, it means life. Emperor: What does it mean when there is white discharge from the intestines? Grand Preceptor: A sinking pulse indicates life, while a floating pulse indicates death. Emperor: What does it mean when there is pus in the intestinal discharge? Grand Preceptor: A hanging and disappearing pulse means death, while a large and sliding pulse means life. Emperor: What does it mean when there is no heat in the intestines, and the pulse is not sinking and disappearing? Grand Preceptor: A large and sliding pulse indicates life, while a tight and sinking pulse indicates death, in accordance with the time of onset. Emperor: What does it mean when there is extreme haste and urgency? Grand Preceptor: The pulse is rapid and slippery, persisting by itself; the pulse is small and tight, leading to death and cannot be treated. Emperor: What does it mean when the pulse in extreme hastiness is weak or strong? Grand Preceptor: If it is weak, it can be treated; if it is strong, it means death. Emperor: What does it mean when the wasting and reality of the pulse are discussed? Grand Preceptor: The reality can be treated, while the strength leads to death.</p>
<p>3: 帝曰：形度骨度脈度筋度，何以知其度也。帝曰：春亟治經絡，夏亟治經俞，秋亟治六府，冬則閉塞。閉塞者，用藥而少鍼石也。所謂少鍼石者，非癰疽之謂也，癰疽不得頃時回。癰不知所，按之不應手，乍來乍已，刺手太陰傍三痏與纓脈各二。掖癰大熱，刺足少陽五，刺而熱不止，刺手心主三，刺手太陰經絡者大骨之會各三。暴癰筋緛，隨分而痛，魄汗不盡，胞氣不足，治在經俞。腹暴滿，按之不下，取手太陽經絡者，胃之募也，少陰俞去脊椎三寸傍五，用員利鍼。霍亂，刺俞傍五，足陽明及上傍三。刺癇驚脈五，鍼手太陰各五，刺經太陽五，刺手少陰經絡傍者一，足陽明一，上踝五寸刺三鍼。
The emperor said: The body can be measured in terms of bones, pulse, and sinews. How do we know the measurements? The emperor said: In spring, treat the channels and collaterals; in summer, treat the channels and tendons; in autumn, treat the six palaces; in winter, close them up. When they are closed up, treatment with medicine is preferred over bloodletting. This is what is meant by using less bloodletting: it does not refer to pimples or boils, as pimples and boils should be treated promptly. A pimple cannot be recognized, and when pressed, it does not respond appropriately. It appears and disappears suddenly, and five needles are inserted into the Taoyang channel at the hand side of the Sanjiao and Larm merge and two into the large intestine channel at the hand side of the Sanjiao and Taiyang. If there is a hot pimple on the loin, five needles are inserted into the Shao Yang channel at the foot, and if the heat does not subside, three needles are inserted into the hand Jueyin channel at the Taiyin channel where the large bones meet, each at a distance of three. When sinews become tense and painful, distribute the treatment to the channels and tendons; the soul sweat does not disperse, and the source energy is insufficient, which can be treated at the Jueyin channel. When the abdomen is distended, it cannot be pressed down, take five needles from the Taiyang channel at the abdominal gathering place, remove two inches of Shao Yin from the spine, and use an Ayush needle. Hoarseness occurs, insert five needles at the Jueyin at a distance of five, and one each into the Yangming channel at the foot and above the ankle, pressing for three needles at the fifth inch of the Achilles tendon.</p>
<p>4: 凡治消癉仆擊，偏枯痿厥，氣滿發逆，肥貴人，則高梁之疾也。隔塞閉絕，上下不通，則暴憂之病也。暴厥而聾，偏塞閉不通，內氣暴薄也。不從內外中風之病，故瘦留著也。蹠跛，寒風濕之病也。黃帝曰：黃疸暴痛，癲疾厥狂，久逆之所生也。五藏不平，六府閉塞之所生也。頭痛耳鳴，九竅不利，腸胃之所生也。
Any treatments for the condition of high lofty people such as therapy to regulate, eliminating the attack of dampness and expelling pathogens, treating the paralysis of the limbs, and restoring vital energy can relieve this condition. Isolated blockage closing off the channels, disruption of Qi flow both above and below leads to acute grief syndrome. Sudden stroke and deafness, partial obstruction or closure of the channels, internal Qi is severely deficient. Not following the principles of treating interior and exterior wind diseases, resulting in emaciation. Limping, cold, damp diseases. The Yellow Emperor said: jaundice, acute pain, blindness, madness, is caused by long-term imbalance of vital energy. Internal organs are not functioning properly, and the blockage of six divisions leads to this condition. Headache and ringing in the ears, blockage of nine orifices, resulting from diseases of the intestines and stomach.</p>
