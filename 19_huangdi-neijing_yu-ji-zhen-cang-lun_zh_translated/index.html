<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：春脈如弦，何如而弦。歧伯對曰：春脈者肝也，東方木也，萬物之所以始生也，故其氣來，耎弱輕虛而滑，端直以長，故曰弦，反此者病。帝曰：何如而反。歧伯曰：其氣來實而強，此謂太過，病在外；其氣來不實而微，此謂不及，病在中。帝曰：春脈太過與不及，其病皆何如。歧伯曰：太過則令人善忘，忽忽眩冒而巔疾；其不及，則令人胸痛引背，下則兩脇胠滿。帝曰：善。
Emperor asked: What is the spring Qi like, and how is the Qi of the spring like a string? He Bo replied: The spring Qi is the liver, representing the east direction and wood, which is the source of the birth of all things. Therefore its energy comes out, strong but weak and light, subtle and slippery, upright and long, hence it is called string, and this refers to illness. Emperor asked: How is the reversed state like? He Bo said: Its Qi is strong and excessive, which means excess on the outside; its Qi is weak and faint, meaning insufficiency within. Emperor asked: What are the diseases when spring Qi is excessive or insufficient? He Bo replied: When it is excessive, it makes people prone to forgetting, dizzy and staggering with a sharp pain; when it is insufficient, it causes pain in the chest referring to the back, and below causing fullness on both sides of the waist. Emperor said: Good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>夏脈如鉤，何如而鉤。歧伯曰：夏脈者心也，南方火也，萬物之所以盛長也，故其氣來盛去衰，故曰鉤，反此者病。帝曰：何如而反。歧伯曰：其氣來盛去亦盛，此謂太過，病在外；其氣來不盛去反盛，此謂不及，病在中。帝曰：夏脈太過與不及，其病皆何如。歧伯曰：太過則令人身熱而膚痛，為浸淫；其不及，則令人煩心，上見欬唾，下為氣泄。帝曰：善。
The Duke of Zhou asked, If the summer pulse is like a hook, what is it like when it is otherwise? The Duke replied: Summer pulse is the heart, and the heat in the south; the source of the growth and prolongation of all things. Therefore its Qi comes and goes abundantly, hence the term 'hook.' But when it is otherwise, there is illness. The Emperor asked, What is it like when it is otherwise? The Duke replied: Its Qi also comes and goes abundantly, which is called excess, the illness being outside. When its Qi does not come and go in abundance but comes in abundance instead, this is called deficiency, the illness being inside. The Emperor asked, What are the illnesses caused by summer pulse excess and deficiency? The Duke replied: Excess causes the person to have a hot body with painful skin and itching; deficiency causes restlessness of mind, with foaming saliva above and the release of gas below. The Emperor said, Good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>秋脈如浮，何如而浮。歧伯曰：秋脈者肺也，西方金也，萬物之所以收成也，故其氣來，輕虛以浮，來急去散，故曰浮，反此者病。帝曰：何如而反。歧伯曰：其氣來，毛而中央堅，兩傍虛，此謂太過，病在外；其氣來，毛而微，此謂不及，病在中。帝曰：秋脈太過與不及，其病皆何如。歧伯曰：太過則令人逆氣而背痛，慍慍然；其不及，則令人喘，呼吸少氣而欬，上氣見血，下聞病音。帝曰：善。
Emperor: The Qi of the season feels light and superficial. How does it feel when it is superficial? 
Obscure Scholar: The Qi of autumn is associated with the lungs, which correspond to the metal element. They are responsible for gathering the essence of all things, so when its energy arises, it is light and superficial because it comes in a hurry and then dissipates quickly. This is why it's called superficial. In this case, the person is sick. 
Emperor: What does it mean to be like that? 
Obscure Scholar: When its energy arises, it is strong in the center but weak on the left and right. This signifies an excessive condition, with the illness being external. The other possibility is when its energy arises, it is subtle, which indicates insufficiency and the illness being internal. 
Emperor: In cases of Qi excess or insufficiency, what does the illness feel like? 
Obscure Scholar: When there is an excess, it causes the person to experience discomfort and back pain. When it's insufficient, it makes the person short of breath, with a reduced intake of air, and a feeling of suffocation. In cases of excessive Qi, one may see blood when exhaling and in cases of insufficient Qi, there will be an audible sound of illness from the lower abdomen. 
Emperor: I understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>冬脈如營，何如而營。歧伯曰：各脈者腎也，北方水也，萬物之所以合藏也，故其氣來，沈以搏，故曰營，反此者病。帝曰：何如而反。歧伯曰：其氣來如彈石者，此謂太過，病在外；其去如數者，此謂不及，病在中。帝曰：冬脈太過與不及，其病皆何如。歧伯曰：太過，則令人解㑊，脊脈痛而少氣不欲言；其不及，則令人心懸如病飢，䏚中清，脊中痛，少腹滿，小便變。帝曰：善。
Master Qi said, The renal channels are like encampments. What is it like to be in such an encampment? The Duke asked, 'What is it like if it is reversed?' Master Qi replied, 'The energy comes like a pebble being thrown, this is called too much excess, the disease is outside. If it goes away like counting, this is called not sufficient, the disease is inside.' The Emperor asked, 'What are the diseases caused by excessive winter channels and insufficient winter channels?' Master Qi replied, 'Excessive, it causes people to be restless, with pain in the back channel and less energy, not wanting to speak. Insufficient, it causes people's hearts to hang like those with disease and hunger, cold sweat dripping down, pain in the back and fullness in the lower abdomen, frequent urination.' The Emperor said, 'Good.'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：四時之序，逆從之變異也，然脾脈獨何主。歧伯曰：脾脈者土也，孤藏以灌四傍者也。帝曰：然則脾善惡，可得見之乎。歧伯曰：善者不可得見，惡者可見。帝曰：惡者何如可見。歧伯曰：其來如水之流者，此謂太過，病在外；如鳥之喙者，此謂不及，病在中。帝曰：夫子言脾為孤藏，中央土以灌四傍，其太過與不及，其病皆何如。歧伯曰：太過，則令人四支不舉；其不及，則令人九竅不通，名曰重強。帝瞿然而起，再拜而稽首曰：善。吾得脈之大要，天下至數，五色脈變，揆度奇恒，道在於一，神轉不迴，迴則不轉，及失其機，至數之要，迫近以微，著之玉版，藏之藏府，每旦讀之，名曰玉機。
Emperor: The sequence of the four seasons and the changes they bring are strange, but who governs the pulse? 
Duke of Shou: The pulse is the Earth, and it alone nourishes the solitary orifices to moisten the four directions. 
Emperor: In that case, can the good or bad pulse be seen? 
Duke of Shou: The good one cannot be seen, but the bad one can be. 
Emperor: How can the bad one be seen? 
Duke of Shou: It comes like a flowing stream, which indicates excessive pathogenic factors, and the illness is outside; or it comes like a bird's beak, indicating inadequate pathogenic factors, and the illness is inside. 
Emperor: Master, you say that the pulse represents the solitary orifices, which are nourished by Earth to moisten the four directions, and your explanation of excessive and inadequate pathogenic factors - how do these manifest in terms of illness? 
Duke of Shou: Excessive pathogenic factors lead to the person's limbs not being raised, while inadequate pathogenic factors lead to the person's nine orifices not being open, and this is called heavy strength. 
Emperor nods and stands up again, bows twice, and says: Good. I have obtained the great principle of the pulse, understanding numbers worldwide, variations in colors of the pulse, measuring the unusual and consistent, the way lies in one thing, the spirit changes without returning, returning leads to not changing, and if it loses its function, it approaches the crux of the numbers, closely observed through the subtle, sealed within the archive office, read daily, called the Jade Machine.</p>

<p>藏受氣於其所生，傳之於其所勝，氣舍於其所生，死於其所不勝。病之且死，必先傳行至其所不勝，病乃死。此言氣之逆行也，故死。肝受氣於心，傳之於脾，氣舍於腎，至肺而死。心受氣於脾，傳之於肺，氣舍於肝，至腎而死。脾受氣於肺，傳之於腎，氣舍於心，至肝而死。肺受氣於腎，傳之於肝，氣舍於脾，至心而死。腎受氣於肝，傳之於心，氣舍於肺，至脾而死。此皆逆死也。一日一夜五分之，此所以占死生之早暮也。
What is received in the lungs and transmitted to the heart, with qi departing from the kidneys, will die at what it cannot control. Disease must first run its course at what one cannot control, and disease leads to death. This refers to the reverse flow of qi, hence death. The liver receives qi in the heart, transmits it to the spleen, qi departs from the kidneys, and dies at the lungs. The heart receives qi in the spleen, transmits it to the lungs, qi departs from the kidneys, and dies at the liver. The spleen receives qi in the lungs, transmits it to the kidneys, qi departs from the heart, and dies at the liver. The kidneys receive qi in the liver, transmit it to the heart, qi departs from the lungs, and die at the spleen. All of these are reverse deaths. Each day and night is divided into five watches, which determines whether one will die early or late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：五藏相通，移皆有次，五藏有病，則各傳其所勝。不治，法三月若六月，若三日若六日，傳五藏而當死，是順傳所勝之次。故曰：別於陽者，知病從來；別於陰者，知死生之期。言知至其所困而死。
Yellow Emperor said: When the Five Organs are connected, moving any one of them has a specific time, and if the Five Organs have diseases, they will pass on their respective strengths. If not treated, according to the law, it may be three months or six months, or three days or six days, passing on the Five Organs means certain death, which is the strength of the successive transmission. Therefore, he said: Separating from yang knows that the disease has always been there; separating from yin knows the time of life and death. Speaking of knowing to the point where one dies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故風者百病之長也，今風寒客於人，使人毫毛畢直，皮膚閉而為熱，當是之時，可汗而發也；或痺不仁腫痛，當是之時，可湯熨及火灸刺而去之。弗治，病入舍於肺，名曰肺痺，發欬上氣。弗治，肺即傳而行之肝，病名曰肝痺，一名曰厥，脇痛出食，當是之時，可按若刺耳。弗治，肝傳之脾，病名曰脾風，發癉，腹中熱，煩心出黃，當此之時，可按可藥可浴。弗治，脾傳之腎，病名曰疝瘕，少腹冤熱而痛，出白，一名曰蠱，當此之時，可按可藥。弗治，腎傳之心，病筋脈相引而急，病名曰瘛，當此之時，可灸可藥。弗治，滿十日，法當死。腎因傳之心，心即復反傳而行之肺，發寒熱，法當三歲死，此病之次也。
Therefore, wind refers to a long-lasting illness. Today, cold winds affect people, causing their hair to stand on end, their skin to close and generate heat, at which time one can sweat; or there is stiffness and numbness, with swelling and pain, at which time one should use warm baths, moxibustion, and acupuncture to treat it. If not treated, the illness settles in the lungs and is called lung stiffness, accompanied by a cough. If not treated, the lung energy blocks the liver, and the disease is called liver stiffness, also known as Qi, with pain in the flanks and fullness in the abdomen; at this time, pressing around the ears can help. If not treated, the liver energy blockage passes to the spleen, and the disease is called spleen wind, with lower abdominal pain and heat, accompanied by yellow discharge, at which time pressing, herbs, and bathing can help. If not treated, the kidney energy blocks the heart, and the heart channels the energy to the lungs, causing cold and heat; if untreated, one will die at three years old, this is the sequence of the disease.</p>

<p>然其卒發者，不必治於傳，或其傳化有不以次，不以次入者，憂恐悲喜怒，令不得以其次，故令人有大病矣。因而喜大虛則腎氣乘矣，怒則肝氣乘矣，悲則肺氣乘矣，恐則脾氣乘矣，憂則心氣乘矣，此其道也。故病有五，五五二十五變，及其傳化。傳，乘之名也。
Those who are suddenly enlightened should not be treated according to tradition, as the tradition may become outdated or misunderstood. If one's emotions include sorrow, joy, anger, and fear, they will not be able to control their own nature, and thus they will fall ill. This is why people who experience sudden enlightenment often develop serious illnesses. Since joy causes the vital energy of the kidneys to rise, anger causes the vital energy of the liver to rise, sorrow causes the vital energy of the lungs to rise, fear causes the vital energy of the spleen to rise, and worry causes the vital energy of the heart to rise, this is their nature. Thus, illnesses arise in five types, with each type having five variations, and these are related to tradition and change. The term transmission refers to influencing.</p>

<p>黃帝曰：凡治病，察其形氣色澤，脈之盛衰，病之新故，乃治之無後其時。形氣相得，謂之可治；色澤以浮，謂之易已；脈從四時，謂之可治；脈弱以滑，是有胃氣，命曰易治，取之以時。形氣相失，謂之難治；色夭不澤，謂之難已；脈實以堅，謂之益甚；脈逆四時，為不可治。必察四難，而明告之。所謂逆四時者，春得肺脈，夏得腎脈，秋得心脈，冬得脾脈，其至皆懸絕沈濇者，命曰逆四時。未有藏形，於春夏而脈沈濇，秋冬而脈浮大，名曰逆四時也。病熱脈靜，泄而脈大，脫血而脈實，病在中脈實堅，病在外，脈不實堅者，皆難治。
Emperor Yellow said: When treating illness, one must examine the patient's appearance, vital energy, color and complexion, pulse strength and weakness, and the new or old stage of the disease before beginning treatment. If the appearance and vital energy are harmonious, it is treatable; if the color and complexion are bright, it is easily cured; if the pulses correspond to the four seasons, it is treatable; if the pulse is weak and slippery, there is stomach qi, and it is called easy to cure. Take advantage of the opportunity when the time is right. If the appearance and vital energy are not harmonious, it is difficult to treat; if the color and complexion are withered and not bright, it is difficult to cure; if the pulse is strong and firm, it means there is much disease; if the pulse is opposite the four seasons, it is incurable. Carefully observe the four difficulties and report them clearly. The so-called opposite four seasons refers to the spring when the lung pulse is present, summer when the kidney pulse is present, autumn when the heart pulse is present, and winter when the spleen pulse is present. All cases where the pulse is sunken and weak in spring and summer, and floating large in autumn and winter are called the opposite four seasons. If there is no consolidation of form, and if the pulse is sunken and weak in spring and summer, and floating large in autumn and winter, it is called the opposite four seasons. In cases where the disease is hot and the pulse is calm, sweating with a large pulse, bleeding with a real pulse, or having a strong and firm pulse inside and a weak and unstable pulse outside, all are difficult to treat.</p>

<p>黃帝曰：余聞虛實以決死生，願聞其情。歧伯曰：五實死，五虛死。帝曰：願聞五實五虛。歧伯曰：脈盛，皮熱，腹脹，前後不通，悶瞀，此謂五實。脈細，皮寒，氣少，泄利前後，飲食不入，此謂五虛。帝曰：其時有生者，何也。歧伯曰：漿粥入胃，泄注止，則虛者活；身汗得後利，則實者活。此其候也。
The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that the distinction between real and false determines life and death, and I wish to hear about its nature. Hui Bo said: Five things are real in death, five things are false in death. Emperor said: I wish to hear about the five real and five false. Hui Bo said: Pulse full, skin hot, abdomen bloated, front and back not connected, restlessness, these are called the five real. Pulse thin, skin cold, qi deficient, leakage of the front and back, food and drink do not enter, these are called the five false. Emperor said: At that time, what is life? Hui Bo said: If rice gruel enters the stomach and leakage stops, then the empty ones will live; if the body sweats and gets posterior discharge, then the full ones will live. This is the opportunity.</p>
