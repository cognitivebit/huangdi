<p>黃帝問于歧伯曰：余聞九鍼於夫子，眾多矣不可勝數，餘推而論之，以為一紀。余司誦之，子聽其理，非則語余，請正其道，令可久傳後世無患，得其人乃傳，非其人勿言。歧伯稽首再拜曰：請聽聖王之道。
Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, saying: I have heard of the Nine Needles from Confucius, and there are far too many to count. After examining and discussing them, I believe it can be considered as a record. I have committed it to memory, and my son has understood its meaning. If my understanding is incorrect, please correct me so that this teaching may be passed down for generations without harm, and only those worthy will pass it on and not speak of it if they are unworthy. Qi Bo bowed and prostrated himself again, saying: Please listen to the way of the holy king.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：用鍼之理，必知形氣之所在，左右上下，陰陽表裏，血氣多少，行之逆順，出入之合，謀伐有過。知解結，知補虛寫實，上下氣門，明通於四海。審其所在，寒熱淋露以輸異處，審於調氣，明於經隧，左右肢絡，盡知其會。寒與熱爭，能合而調之，虛與實鄰，知決而通之，左右不調，把而行之，明於逆順，乃知可治，陰陽不奇，故知起時。審於本末，察其寒熱，得邪所在，萬刺不殆。知官九鍼，刺道畢矣。
Yellow Emperor said: The logic of acupuncture is to know the location of form and qi, left and right, up and down, yin and yang's exterior and interior, the amount of blood and qi, whether it goes in reverse or not, whether it enters or exits smoothly, whether there are plans to attack. Knowing the principles, knowing how to supplement and write the virtual and the real, opening and closing the air gate, understanding clearly in the four seas. Examine its location, examine cold and heat as they flow elsewhere, examine regulating qi, understand the classic passage, left and right tendons, know their intentions completely. Cold and heat contend, but can regulate and harmonize them, knowing the boundaries between emptiness and reality, passing through them completely, understanding reverse and forward, and thus knowing you can treat it. Examine beginnings and endings, examine cold and heat, find where the pathogens are, among thousands of needles there is no exhaustion. Knowing the official nine needles, the acupuncture course is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>明於五俞徐疾所在，屈伸出入，皆有條理。言陰與陽，合於五行，五藏六府，亦有所藏，四時八風，盡有陰陽。各得其位，合於明堂，各處色部，五藏六府。察其所痛，左右上下，知其寒溫，何經所在。審皮膚之寒溫滑澀，知其所苦，膈有上下，知其氣所在。先得其道，稀而疏之，稍深以留，故能徐入之。大熱在上，推而下之；從上下者，引而去之；視前痛者，常先取之。大寒在外，留而補之；入于中者，從合寫之。鍼所不為，灸之所宜。上氣不足，推而揚之；下氣不足，積而從之；陰陽皆虛，火自當之。厥而寒甚，骨廉陷下，寒過於膝，下陵三里。陰絡所過，得之留止，寒入于中，推而行之；經陷下者，火則當之；結絡堅緊，火所治之。不知所苦，兩蹻之下，男陰女陽，良工所禁，鍼論畢矣。
In the residence of Xu Jí, there is a logical order to entering and exiting. Talking about yin and yang, they correspond with the Five Phases, the Five Viscera and Six Bowels also have their places, the four seasons and eight winds also have yin and yang. Each gets its proper position in the Bright Hall, each area of color corresponds to the Five Viscera and Six Bowels. By examining where it hurts, left and right, up and down, one knows its cold or warmth, which meridian it is in according to the Acupuncture and Moxibustion Canon. First determine its course, then thin and scatter it slightly, gradually deepening it so that one can enter slowly. Great Heat is above, push it down; from top to bottom, guide it away; when there is pain in front, take it first. Great Cold is outside, retain it and supplement it; when it enters the center, write from the union. Acupuncture should not be used without Moxibustion, and moxibustion should be applied where acupuncture is appropriate. If the Qi is not sufficient above, push and raise it; if the Qi is not sufficient below, accumulate and send it from below. When yin and yang are both deficient, fire will arise of itself. Extreme cold in the channels, bones sink downwards, cold exceeding the knees, knees sink downwards three li. The channel passes through, stop and hold it there, cold enters within, push and move it; at the place where the channel sinks down, fire will act upon it; knotted and tightened ligaments, fire is what treats them. Not knowing where it hurts, both legs bend downwards, male and female, skillful practitioners must restrain themselves in their discussion of Acupuncture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>用鍼之服，必有法則，上視天光，下司八正，以辟奇邪，而觀百姓，審於虛實，無犯其邪。是得天之靈，遇歲之虛，救而不勝，反受其殃，故曰必知天忌，乃言鍼意。
Using acupuncture, there is a method; it relies on the celestial order and governs the Eight Constellations. It dispels strange and evil forces, and considers the common people while judging between truth and falsehood, without violating their nature. By doing so, one can receive the spirit of Heaven and encounter the vacuity of the year, rescuing but not being victorious, and eventually suffering its harm. Therefore, knowing the Heavenly aversion, this is called the intention of acupuncture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>法於往古，驗於來今，觀於窈冥，通於無窮。麤之所不見，良工之所貴。莫知其形，若神髣彿。
Law from the past, verified in today and tomorrow, observed in hidden and profound, pervading inexhaustible. What the brush doesn't show, the skilled artist cherishes. Not knowing its form, like the divine Qi of antiquity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>邪氣之中人也，洒淅動形；正邪之中人也，微先見於色，不知於其身，若有若無，若亡若存，有形無形，莫知其情。是故上工之取氣，乃救其萌芽；下工守其已成，因敗其形。
In the chaos of evil, a person is scattered and disordered in their movements; between good and evil, a person first appears in color, but does not know it within themselves. It is like having or not having, being alive or dead, having form but no form, and no one knows their state. Therefore, when taking the upper hand in cultivation, it is to save the budding potential; when practicing the lower techniques, guarding what has already become successful allows for the destruction of its form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故工之用鍼也，知氣之所在，而守其門戶，明於調氣，補寫所在，徐疾之意，所取之處。寫必用員，切而轉之，其氣乃行，疾而徐出，邪氣乃出，伸而迎之，遙大其穴，氣出乃疾。補必用方，外引其皮，令當其門，左引其樞，右推其膚，微旋而徐推之，必端以正，安以靜，堅心無解，欲微以留，氣下而疾出之，推其皮，蓋其外門，真氣乃存。用鍼之要，無忘其神。
Therefore, the use of an acupuncture needle is to know where the qi is located and guard its door and window. One can excel in regulating qi and supplementing where it is needed. The speed may be fast or slow according to what one intends to take. Writing must use assistants, cut and turn them, and the qi will move quickly and come out smoothly. When treating evil qi, extend and meet them at a distance, open their orifices so that the qi can come out quickly. To supplement, one must use proper methods. Externally draw their skin, position themselves at the door of their passageways, left pull their joints, and right push their skin, turning it gently and pushing it slowly until it is upright, calm and firm. The will to be subtle is there to preserve it. Let qi descend quickly and come out forcefully, push their skin, seal their outer door, true qi will remain. The essence of acupuncture is not to forget the spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>雷公問於黃帝曰：鍼論曰：得其人乃傳，非其人勿言，何以知其可傳？黃帝曰：各得其人，任之其能，故能明其事。雷公曰：願聞官能奈何？黃帝曰：明目者，可使視色；聰耳者，可使聽音；捷疾辭語者，可使傳論；語徐而安靜，手巧而心審諦者，可使行鍼艾，理血氣而調諸逆順，察陰陽而兼諸方。緩節柔筋而心和調者，可使導引行氣；疾毒言語輕人者，可使唾癰呪病；爪苦手毒，為事善傷者，可使按積抑痺。各得其能，方乃可行，其名乃彰。不得其人，其功不成，其師無名。故曰：得其人乃言，非其人勿傳，此之謂也。手毒者，可使試按龜，置龜於器下，而按其上，五十日而死矣，手甘者，復生如故也。
Lei Gong asked Yellow Emperor, The Longevity Needle Classic says that if you obtain a person's gift, it will be passed on, and not speaking of it is not an issue; how do you know it can be passed on? Yellow Emperor replied, Each obtains their person's gift and lets them develop their skills, so they are able to succeed in their tasks. Lei Gong said, I would like to hear about the officials who excel at this? Yellow Emperor said, Those who see clearly can use seeing colors; those who are clever can hear sounds; those who are skilled at speaking and writing quickly can transmit theories; those who speak slowly and maintain peacefulness, have nimble hands and careful minds can practice acupuncture and moxibustion, regulate blood and qi, and differentiate yin and yang while understanding all aspects. Those who are calm, gentle, soft, and harmonious in heart and temperament can guide the circulation of qi; those who speak harshly and lightly injure people can curse diseases; those with bitter hands and poisonous palms, skilled at causing harm for their work, can press and suppress blockages. Each one develops their skills, and only then can they succeed, and their names will be distinguished. Not obtaining someone's gift, their achievements will not be completed, and their teachers will remain unknown. Hence, obtaining someone's gift is speaking; not passing it on is not an issue, this is what I mean. The master who can test the needles can place the turtle shell on a container, press its top, and after 50 days, the turtle will die, but if the shell is unyielding, it will revive as before.</p>
