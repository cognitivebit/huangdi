<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：五運更治，上應天朞，陰陽往復，寒暑迎隨，真邪相薄，內外分離，六經波蕩，五氣傾移，太過不及，專勝兼并，願言其始，而有常名，可得聞乎。歧伯稽首再拜對曰：昭乎哉問也，是明道也。此上帝所貴，先師傳之，臣雖不敏，往聞其旨。帝曰：余聞得其人不教，是謂失道，傳非其人，慢泄天寶。余誠菲德，未足以受至道，然而眾子哀其不終，願夫子保於無窮，流於無極，余司其事則而行之，柰何。歧伯曰：請遂言之也。上經曰：夫道者，上知天文，下知地理，中知人事，可以長久，此之謂也。帝曰：何謂也。歧伯曰：本氣，位也。位天者，天文也。位地者，地理也。通於人氣之變化者，人事也，故太過者先天，不及者後天，所謂治化而人應之也。
Emperor asked: The five phases have changed, the upper corresponds to heaven's clarity, yin and yang change repeatedly, cold and heat follow suit, true and false are intertwined, internal and external diverge, the six classics fluctuate, the five qi incline towards imbalance, too much cannot be met, exclusive success and joint victory are achieved, I wish to inquire about the beginning of this, and there is a constant name that can be heard about it. Master Huan responded by bowing and kneeling again, replying: How brilliant the question is, it is the teachings of the true way. This matter treasured by the Emperor has been passed down by ancient sages, although I am not very quick-witted, I have heard about its intent. The Emperor said: I have heard from others that those who do not pass down this way are considered to have lost the path and carelessly spill heaven's treasure. I sincerely appreciate your teachings, but I am still insufficient to receive the highest way, yet my many sons lament that it was not completed, I hope that Master Huan can preserve it without exhaustion and flow without limit, so how should I proceed? Master Huan replied: Please allow me to explain this matter. The ancient classics say: The Way is knowing heaven's patterns above, understanding earth's principles below, and knowing human affairs in the middle, which can be long-lasting; this is what it means. The Emperor asked: What does that mean? Master Huan replied: It is the foundation and position. Positioned by heaven, it is heaven's patterns. Positioned by earth, it is earth's principles. Understanding human qi changes, it is human affairs, so too much leads to an earlier heavenly pattern, and not met with is a later heavenly pattern; this is called adjusting the seasons and people respond accordingly</p>

Emporer: What is the result of the five elements' transformations? Prime Minister: The wood element is overly prevalent this year, resulting in wind and dryness. The earth and soil are being attacked by evil qi. People are suffering from diarrhea, vomiting, and reduced appetite, their bodies are heavy and burdened with aches, their intestines are bloated and painful, and they are experiencing symptoms that correspond to the seasonal stars. In severe cases, they suddenly become prone to anger, have dizziness, blurred vision, disorientation, and indigestion; the lungs are being attacked by evil qi. People suffer from fever, shortness of breath, excessive bleeding, nosebleeds, and back pain, corresponding to the stars of confusion. Their bodies ache, with bone-deep pain, and they develop sores. Recovery is difficult, as their lungs are unable to regulate Qi properly. There is rain and cold, and the meridians are not functioning properly. People suffer from fatigue, dizziness, indigestion, loss of appetite, deafness, back pain, shoulder pain, and painful joints in the elbows and hips. In severe cases, they may experience convulsions and vomiting blood; if the Yang Meridian is affected, death is inevitable and cannot be treated. This corresponds to the stars of confusion. The earth element has become overly prevalent this year, causing rain and dampness to spread. People are suffering from abdominal pain, and their minds are not at ease. Their bodies are heavy and burdened with aches. The Kidneys are being affected by evil qi. In severe cases, muscles weaken and legs become unstable, while the feet hurt and people suffer from bloating and excessive diarrhea. Bile accumulates in the intestines, causing pain and bleeding; in extreme cases, if the Chong Meridian is affected, death is inevitable and cannot be treated, corresponding to the seasonal stars. The metal element has become overly prevalent this year, causing dryness and heat to spread. People suffer from pain in their lower back and waist, as well as fever. They have red, painful eyes and ear problems, often accompanied by coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. If the evil qi affects the Yang Meridian, it leads to severe symptoms, such as convulsions, vomiting blood, and pain in the hip, genitals, knees, ankles, and toes. This corresponds to the stars of confusion. The water element has become overly prevalent this year, causing coldness and evil qi to spread. People suffer from fever, restlessness, insanity, and delusions, often accompanied by shortness of breath, excessive sweating, and indigestion. In severe cases, there is an overflow of evil qi, leading to the cessation of Yang Meridian function; if the Kidney Yin is affected, death is inevitable and cannot be treated, corresponding to the seasonal stars.

<p>帝曰：善。願聞其時也。歧伯曰：悉哉問也。木不及，春有鳴條律暢之化，則秋有霧露清涼之政。春有慘凄殘賊之勝，則夏有炎暑燔爍之復。其眚東，其藏肝，其病內舍胠脇，外在關節。火不及，夏有炳明光顯之化，則冬有嚴肅霜寒之政。夏有慘淒凝冽之勝，則不時有埃昏大雨之復。其眚南，其藏心，其病內舍膺脇，外在經絡。土不及，四維有埃雲潤澤之化，則春有鳴條鼓拆之政。四維發振拉飄騰之變，則秋有肅殺霖霪之復。其眚四維，其藏脾，其病內舍心腹，外在肌肉四支。金不及，夏有光顯鬱蒸之令，則冬有嚴凝整肅之應。夏有炎爍燔燎之變，則秋有冰雹霜雪之復。其眚西，其藏肺，其病內舍膺脇肩背，外在皮毛。水不及，四維有湍潤埃雲之化，則不時有和風生發之應。四維發埃昏驟注之變，則不時有飄蕩振拉之復。其眚北，其藏腎，其病內舍腰脊骨髓，外在谿谷踹膝。夫五運之政，猶權衡也，高者抑之，下者舉之，化者應之，變者復之，此生長化成收藏之理，氣之常也，失常則天地四塞矣。故曰：天地之動靜，神明為之紀，陰陽之往復，寒暑彰其兆，此之謂也。
The emperor said: Good. I wish to hear about its time. Duke of Shao replied: How marvelous the question is. If wood does not prevail, in spring there will be the sound of birds and the laws of graceful transformation; then in autumn there will be the political cleansing of mist and dew. In spring there will be a victory over the cruel robbers, then in summer there will be the brightness and heat of the sun's scorching and burning. Its influence goes east; its treasure is the liver; its disease lies within the diaphragm and flanks, manifesting externally in the joints.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If fire does not prevail, in summer there will be the brilliance and clarity of light, then in winter there will be the stern and frigid coldness of frost. In summer there will be a victory over the bitter cold, harsh freezing, and sometimes there will be heavy, dark rain. Its influence goes south; its treasure is the heart; its disease lies within the diaphragm, manifesting externally in the channels.</p>
<p>If earth does not prevail, in the four seasons there will be clouds, richness, and fertility, then in spring there will be the political wind of drumming and dismantling. In autumn, there will be a stern, killing frost. Its influence goes everywhere; its treasure is the spleen; its disease lies within the diaphragm, manifesting externally in the heart, abdomen, and the four limbs' muscles.</p>
<p>If metal does not prevail, in summer there will be the brightness and suffocating heat of the sun, then in winter there will be the stern, freezing coldness of hail, sleet, and snow. Its influence goes west; its treasure is the lungs; its disease lies within the diaphragm, manifesting externally in the shoulders, back, skin, and hair.</p>
<p>If water does not prevail, in the four seasons there will be floods, richness, and clouds, then sometimes there will be a gentle breeze arising. In autumn, there will be gusts, scattering, pulling, and lifting. Its influence goes north; its treasure is the kidneys; its disease lies within the waist, spine, bones, and marrow, manifesting externally in the valleys and knee joints.</p>
<p>The emperor said: Indeed, the five powers' orderliness is like a balance, high ones suppress it, low ones support it, responding to it, changing it, this is the principle of growth, decline, succession, and storage in nature, the norm of qi, losing it brings chaos to heaven and earth. Therefore, he said: The movement and stillness of heaven and earth, the spirits create their records. The ebb and flow of yin and yang, the clarity of cold and heat, this is what is called their signs.</p>

<p>帝曰：夫子之言五氣之變，四時之應，可謂悉矣。夫氣之動亂，觸遇而作，發無常會，卒然災合，何以期之。歧伯曰：夫氣之動變，固不常在，而德化政令災變不同其候也。帝曰：何謂也。歧伯曰：東方生風，風生木，其德敷和，其化生榮，其政舒啟，其令風，其變振發，其災散落。南方生熱，熱生火，其德彰顯，其化蕃茂，其政明曜，其令熱，其變銷爍，其災燔焫。中央生濕，濕生土，其德溽蒸，其化豈備，其政安靜，其令濕，其變驟注，其災霖潰。西方生燥，燥生金，其德清潔，其化緊斂，其政勁切，其令燥，其變肅殺，其災蒼隕。北方生寒，寒生水，其德淒滄，其化清謐，其政凝肅，其令寒，其變凓冽，其災冰雪霜雹。是以察其動也，有德有化，有政有令，有變有災，而物由之，而人應之也。
The Emperor said: Master Zhou's words on the five changes of qi and the four correspondences are now fully understood. When qi is dynamic and chaotic, it happens when encountering a trigger, producing inconstant combinations that lead to sudden disasters. How can one foresee this? The Duke of Zhou replied: The dynamics and transformations of qi are not constant, but through the virtues of goodness, governance will prevent such changes from becoming as unpredictable as the weather. The Emperor asked: What do you mean by that? The Duke of Zhou replied: In the east, there is wind, which generates wood. Its virtue is broad and harmonious; its transformation produces fame; its governance is expansive and enlightening, issuing decrees that promote growth and development, with changes being vibrant and flourishing, and disasters being dispersed and dissipated. In the south, there is heat, which generates fire. Its virtue is clear and prominent; its transformation fosters weeds; its governance is bright and illuminating, issuing decrees that promote burning and combustion, with changes being destructive and devastating, and disasters being conflagrations and incineration. In the center, there is moisture, which generates soil. Its virtue is humid and steamy; its transformation produces moderation; its governance is peaceful and tranquil, issuing decrees that promote rain and inundation, with changes being sudden and saturating, and disasters being floods and inundations. In the west, there is aridity, which generates metal. Its virtue is clear and purified; its transformation is stringent and severe; its governance is forceful and decisive, issuing decrees that promote oppression and slaughter, with changes being ominous and threatening, and disasters being hailstones and air raids. In the north, there is cold, which generates water. Its virtue is frigid and vast; its transformation produces clarity; its governance is solid and restrained, issuing decrees that promote freezing and frostbite, with changes being hoary and icy, and disasters being blizzards and snowstorms. By observing these changes, there will be virtues and transformations, governance and decrees, changes and disasters. All things will undergo change, and people will respond accordingly.</p>

<p>帝曰：夫子之言歲候，不及其太過，而上應五星。今夫德化政令災眚變易，非常而有也，卒然而動，其亦為之變乎。歧伯曰：承天而行之，故無妄動，無不應也。卒然而動者，氣之交變也，其不應焉。故曰應常不應卒，此之謂也。帝曰：其應柰何。歧伯曰：各從其氣化也。帝曰：其行之徐疾逆順何如。歧伯曰：以道留久，逆守而小，是謂省下。以道而去，去而速來，曲而過之，是謂省遺過也。久留而環，或離或附，是謂議災與其德也。應近則小，應遠則大。芒而大倍常之一其化甚，大常之二其眚即也。小常之一其化減，小常之二是謂臨視，省下之過與其德也。德者福之，過者伐之。是以象之見也，高而遠則小，下而近則大，故大則喜怒邇，小則禍福遠。歲運太過，則運星北越，運氣相得，則各行以道。故歲運太過，畏星失色而兼其母，不及，則色兼其所不勝。肖者瞿瞿，莫知其妙，閔閔之當，孰者為良，妄行無徵，示畏侯王。帝曰：其災應何如。歧伯曰：亦各從其化也，故時至有盛衰，凌犯有逆順，留守有多少，形見有善惡，宿屬有勝負，徵應有吉凶矣。帝曰：其善惡，何謂也。歧伯曰：有喜有怒，有憂有喪，有澤有燥，此象之常也，必謹察之。帝曰：六者，高下異乎。歧伯曰：象見高下其應一也，故人亦應之。
Emperor: The Master's words follow the course of the seasons, but do not go beyond it; they rise in response to the Five Stars. Now, with virtue guiding political decrees and calamities changing and shifting without cease, there must be a constant cause for their movement. Sudden movements are due to changes in vital energy; can such movements be avoided? Therefore, it is said that one should follow the constancy and not the suddenness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Duke Huan: By following the will of Heaven, there will be no unintended actions or failure to respond. Sudden movements result from changes in vital energy; how could they fail to respond? That is why it is said to follow constancy, not suddenness, and this is what is meant by it.</p>
<p>Emperor: What does following constancy entail?</p>
<p>Duke Huan: Each should act according to their own vital energy.</p>
<p>Emperor: How are they to act in terms of speed and direction?</p>
<p>Duke Huan: If the Way is followed for a long time, it will be conservative in scope and direction, which can be called foresight. If the Way is abandoned, it will come quickly and pass by, taking a roundabout route, which can be called catching up with what has been missed. Staying too long and circling may result in both disaster and virtue being mixed together.</p>
<p>When constancy is close, the signs are small; when constancy is distant, they are large. The influence of great constancy is obvious, and its manifestations are evident. Small constancy, on the other hand, has its influences reduced, and these are what mix foresight with actions taken and missed opportunities with virtue. Virtue brings blessing, while excess brings punishment.</p>
<p>Therefore, the oracle bone divination we see shows that when high, it is small, and when low, it is large; thus, if large, it evokes joy and anger, and if small, it leads to fortune or misfortune being distant. Seasons bring excessive change, and the stars move northward; when vital energy and stars meet, each follows their own Way. Thus, when seasons bring excessive change, people fear the loss of color in the stars and avoid them, but if they do not, the color will be lost.</p>
<p>The oracle bone divination is unclear, and nobody knows its meaning, so who can say whether it is good or bad? When disasters follow constancy, there are times of flourishing and decline, offenses committed in inverse proportion to adherence to the Way, guarding with varying degrees of thoroughness, appearances that are good or evil, and relationships between those who prevailed and those who were defeated. The omens show signs of both good and bad fortune.</p>
<p>Emperor: How do disasters follow constancy?</p>
<p>Duke Huan: Just as each follows their own vital energy, so too do the disasters. Therefore, at times there will be times of abundance and decline, offenses committed in inverse proportion to adherence to the Way, guarding with varying degrees of thoroughness, appearances that are good or evil, and relationships between those who prevailed and those who were defeated. The omens show signs of both good and bad fortune.</p>
<p>Emperor: What do the good and bad mean?</p>
<p>Duke Huan: There is joy and anger, sorrow and grief, dryness and moisture; these are the constant signs of the oracle bone divination, and they must be meticulously studied.</p>

<li>帝曰：善。其德化政令之動靜損益，皆何如。歧伯曰：夫德化政令災變，不能相加也。勝復盛衰，不能相多也。往來小大，不能相過也。用之升降，不能相無也。各從其動而復之耳。帝曰：其病生何如。歧伯曰：德化者氣之祥，政令者氣之章，變易者復之紀，災眚者傷之始，氣相勝者和，不相勝者病，重感於邪，則甚也。帝曰：善。所謂精光之論，大聖之業，宣明大道，通於無窮，究於無極也。余聞之，善言天者，必應於人，善言古者，必驗於今，善言氣者，必彰於物，善言應者，同天地之化，善言化言變者，通神明之理。非夫子，孰能言至道歟。迺擇良兆而藏之靈室，每旦讀之，命曰氣交變，非齊戒不敢發，慎傳也。
The Emperor asked: What is the effect of the changing and unchanging aspects of governance on benefit or harm? Duke of Zhou replied: The virtue-based governance and laws change with the times, and cannot be added together. The rise and decline, the small and great, and the coming and going cannot be compared. Their application causes them to wax and wane, and cannot be combined. Each should follow its movement and then stop. The Emperor asked: What are the symptoms of this disease? Duke of Zhou replied: The virtue is the auspicious energy, while the governance laws are the appropriate energy; the changes and transformations are the record-keeping, calamities are the initial injury, the energy that prevails brings harmony, while the lack thereof brings sickness. It heavily affects evil spirits. The Emperor said: Good. This is the discussion of the profound light and great sagely work, clarifying the Great Way, extending to inexhaustible wonders, and reaching the ultimate extremes. I have heard it said that whoever speaks of the highest way must respond in humans, must verify the ancients, must manifest the energy in things, must harmonize with the transformation of heaven and earth, and must interpret transformations into the principles of spirits. Who besides Confucius could speak of the ultimate way? Now I have chosen a good omen and hidden it in the spiritual room, and every day read it aloud. The command says: energy exchange and transformation. This is not to be revealed carelessly or hastily, but to be cautious when transmitting it</li>
