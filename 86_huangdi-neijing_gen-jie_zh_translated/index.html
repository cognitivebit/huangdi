<h1 id="_1">根結</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>歧伯曰：天地相感，寒暖相移，陰陽之道，孰少孰多，陰道偶，陽道奇。發于春夏，陰氣少，陽氣多，陰陽不調，何補何寫。發于秋冬，陽氣少，陰氣多；陰氣盛而陽氣衰，故莖葉枯槁，濕雨下歸，陰陽相移，何寫何補。奇邪離經，不可勝數，不知根結，五藏六府，折關敗樞，開閤而走，陰陽大失，不可復取。九鍼之玄，要在終始；故能知終始，一言而畢，不知終始，鍼道咸絕。
Oboe said: The changes in the world, the alternation of cold and warm, are according to the way of yin and yang. Is there anything more abundant or less abundant? The path of yin is occasional, while the path of yang is extraordinary. It arises during spring and summer; yin energy is insufficient and yang energy is abundant, yin and yang are not harmonious, what can one supplement and what can one write. It arises in autumn and winter, yang energy is insufficient and yin energy is abundant; the abundance of yin energy leads to the decline of yang energy, resulting in withered tendrils and fallen leaves, rain falling and returning, yin and yang changing, what can one write and what can one supplement. The strange and perverse classic of the left channel cannot be counted, not knowing its root and branch, the five organs and six palaces, twisted cords breaking axles, opening shutters and going astray, the failure of yin and yang is great, unable to be taken back. The mystery of the nine needles lies in beginning and end; thus, knowing beginning and end, one's words are concluded, not knowing beginning and end, the path of needles is lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>太陽根于至陰，結于命門。命門者，目也。陽明根于厲兌，結于顙大。顙大者，鉗耳也。少陽根于竅陰，結于窗籠。窗籠者，耳中也。太陽為開，陽明為閤，少陽為樞，故開折，則肉節瀆而暴病起矣。故暴病者，取之太陽，視有餘不足。瀆者，皮肉宛膲而弱也。閤折，則氣無所止息而痿疾起矣。故痿疾者，取之陽明，視有餘不足。無所止息者，真氣稽留，邪氣居之也。樞折，即骨繇而不安于地。故骨繇者，取之少陽，視有餘不足。骨繇者，節緩而不收也。所謂骨繇者，搖故也。當竊其本也。
The Sun's root lies in the utmost Yin, and it unites at the command gate. The command gate is the eye. The Yang Brightness's root lies in severity, and it unites at the mouth corner. The mouth corner is the earlobe. If one lacks the Sun, then one will have deficiency diseases. One who has deficiency diseases takes from the Sun; if there is still not enough, it indicates a severe problem. Deficiency refers to the skin and flesh becoming weak. If the Yang Brightness is interrupted, then the Qi will be unable to rest and weakness and agility will arise. Those with weakness and agility take from the Yang Brightness; if there is still not enough, it indicates a severe problem. When Qi is unable to rest, evil Qi resides within. If the Lesser Yin is interrupted, then the body will be insecure and unstable. Those who are unsteady on their feet take from the Lesser Yin; if there is still not enough, it indicates a severe problem. The Lesser Yin refers to limbs that do not contract and collect. All talk of unsteadiness refers to the original disorder. It must be sought at its source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>太陰根于隱白，結于太倉。少陰根于湧泉，結于廉泉。厥陰根于大敦，結于玉英，絡于膻中。太陰為開，厥陰為闔，少陽為樞。故開折，則倉廩無所輸，膈洞。膈洞者，取之太陰，視有餘不足，故開折者，氣不足而生病也。閤折，即氣絕而喜悲。悲者取之厥陰，視有餘不足。樞折，則脈有所結而不通。不通者，取之少陰，視有餘不足，有結者，皆取之不足。
The Yin is rooted in obscurity and whiteness, and connects with the Bao Palace. The Shao Yin is rooted in the bubbling spring and connects with the Lian Quan. The Ren Yin is rooted in Donghai and connects with the Yuying, and is attached to the Qihai. The Yin opens, the Ren closes, and the Shao Yang serves as the axis. Therefore, if the Yin is opened, then the Bao Palace and Mansion will have no outlet, causing the Qi to be blocked. Blocked Qi leads to illness. If it is folded, one experiences sadness and grief. Grief connects with the Ren Yin, and if there is not enough, it can lead to illness. When the axis is bent, then there will be knots in the meridians but they will not flow properly. Not flowing properly means that it connects with the Shao Yin, and if there are knots, then all of these can be traced back to a lack.</p>

<p>足太陽根于至陰，溜于京骨，注于昆侖，入于天柱、飛揚也。足少陽根于竅陰，溜于丘墟，注于陽輔，入于天容、光明也。足陽明根于厲兌，溜于沖陽，注于下陵，入于人迎，豐隆也。手太陽根于少澤，溜于陽谷，注于小海，入于天窗，支正也。手少陽根于關沖，溜于陽池，注于支溝，入于天牖、外關也。手陽明根于商陽，溜于合谷，注于陽谿，入于扶突、偏歷也。此所謂十二經者，盛絡皆當取之。

<p>一日一夜五十營，以營五藏之精，不應數者，名曰狂生。所謂五十營者，五藏皆受氣，持其脈口，數其至也。五十動而不一代者，五藏皆受氣。四十動一代者，一藏無氣。三十動一代者，二藏無氣。二十動一代者，三藏無氣。十動一代者，四藏無氣。不滿十動一代者，五藏無氣。予之短期，要在終始。所謂五十動而不一代者，以為常也。以知五藏之期，予之短期者，乍數乍疏也。
One day and one night, there are fifty camps. Each camp corresponds to the essence of the five organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys). The one without a count is called Kūnghsīng. Regarding the fifty camps, when all five organs receive qi and hold their pulse points, they are counted as being at that level. When fifty movements occur without passing into the next generation, all five organs receive qi. When forty movements have passed into the next generation, one organ has no qi. When thirty movements have passed into the next generation, two organs have no qi. When twenty movements have passed into the next generation, three organs have no qi. When ten movements have passed into the next generation, four organs have no qi. When fewer than ten movements have passed into the next generation, all five organs have no qi. My understanding of this is limited to the beginning and end (terminus a quo and terminus ad quem). Regarding the fifty movements without passing into the next generation, it can be considered as a constant. Knowing the time of the five organs through my understanding of this short period, my estimation fluctuates between being too many or too few</p>

<p>黃帝曰：逆順五體者，言人骨節之大小，肉之堅脆，皮之厚薄，血之清濁，氣之滑澀，脈之長短，血之多少，經絡之數，余已知之矣，此皆布衣匹夫之士也。夫王公大人，血食之君，身體柔脆，肌肉軟弱，血氣慓悍滑利，其刺之徐疾淺深多少，可得同之乎。歧伯答曰：膏梁菽藿之味，何可同也？氣滑即出疾，其氣澀則出遲，氣悍則鍼小而入淺，氣澀則鍼大而入深，深則欲留，淺則欲疾。以此觀之，刺布衣者，深以留之，刺大人者，微以徐之，此皆因氣慓悍滑利也。
Yellow Emperor said: The five aspects of inverse and direct are about comparing the size of a person's words, bones, meat, skin, blood, and qi. I have already known these as they pertain to commoners. Now, the noblemen and rulers, who consume food and blood, have bodies that are both soft and tough, their muscles weak and pliable, their blood and qi subtle and slippery, how fast or slow their needling will be shallow or deep depends on it. The Duke of Shao replied: What is the taste of ointment, moxa, and cassia? If the qi is rapid, it will produce swift results; if the qi is sluggish, it will produce delayed results; if the qi is fierce, the needle will be small and shallow; if the qi is deep, the needle will be large and deep. If deep, one wants to retain it, if shallow, one wants to make it swift. This is all because of the subtle and slippery nature of the qi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：形氣之逆順奈何？歧伯曰：形氣不足，病氣有餘，是邪勝也，急寫之；形氣有餘，病氣不足，急補之；形氣不足，病氣不足，此陰陽氣俱不足也，不可刺之，刺之則重不足。重不足則陰陽俱竭，血氣皆盡，五藏空虛，筋骨髓枯，老者絕滅，壯者不復矣。形氣有餘，病氣有餘，此謂陰陽俱有餘也。急寫其邪，調其虛實。故曰：有餘者寫之，不足者補之，此之謂也。
Yellow Emperor said: What about the reversal of Qi? Qi Master said: When the body's Qi is insufficient and pathogenic Qi is abundant, it means that pathogenic Qi triumphs. Treat it urgently. When the body's Qi is abundant and pathogenic Qi is insufficient, treat it urgently by supplementing. If both the body's Qi and pathogenic Qi are deficient, this indicates that both Yin and Yang Qi are insufficient; it is not advisable to treat with acupuncture. If treated with acupuncture, it will lead to further insufficiency. When there is insufficiency, both Yin and Yang Qi will be depleted, blood and Qi will all be exhausted, the Five Organs will be empty, tendons and bones will turn brittle, causing the old to perish and the strong to wither away. When the body's Qi is abundant and pathogenic Qi is abundant, this means that both Yin and Yang have sufficient Qi. Expelling the pathogenic Qi and adjusting its reality. Therefore it is said: For what has sufficiency, treat it by expelling; for what is deficient, supplement it; this is what is meant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>故曰：刺不知逆順，真邪相搏。滿而補之，則陰陽四溢，腸胃充郭，肝肺內䐜，陰陽相錯。虛而寫之，則經脈空虛，血氣竭枯，腸胃㒤辟，皮膚薄著，毛腠夭膲，予之死期。
It is said that needling fails to distinguish between right and wrong, true and false. If the channels are overfilled, there will be an excess of yin and yang, making the organs of the stomach and intestines overflow, causing confusion between yin and yang. If the channels are vacuous, then the meridians and vessels are empty, blood and qi exhausted, causing the stomach and intestines to become blocked, the skin and hair thinning and wasting away, resulting in death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>故曰：用鍼之要，在於知調陰與陽。調陰與陽，精氣乃光，合形與氣，使神內藏。故曰：上工平氣，中工亂脈，下工絕氣危生。故曰：下工不可不慎也，必審五藏變化之病，五脈之應，經絡之實虛，皮之柔麤，而後取之也。
It is said: The skill of using an acupuncture needle lies in knowing the balance between Yin and Yang. Balancing Yin and Yang, the essence-qi shines, harmonizes form and qi, and encloses the spirit within. Therefore, it is said: In superior work, one regulates the qi; in middle work, one disrupts the pulse; and in inferior work, one seizes the breath and endangers life. Therefore, it is said: One must be cautious in inferior work, carefully discerning changes in the Five Organs' diseases, the appropriate timing of the pulse, the reality of the channels and vessels, the pliability of the skin, and only then proceed with taking the needle.</p>
