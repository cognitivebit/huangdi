<h1 id="_1">熱論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：今夫熱病者，皆傷寒之類也，或愈或死，其死皆以六七日之閒，其愈皆以十日以上者，何也。不知其解，願聞其故。歧伯對曰：巨陽者，諸陽之屬也，其脈連於風府，故為諸陽主氣也。人之傷於寒也，則為病熱，熱雖甚不死，其兩感於寒而病者，必不免於死。
The Yellow Emperor asked, saying: Today, all cases of fever are due to damage from cold. Some recover and some die. Those who die usually do so within six or seven days, and those who recover usually take more than ten days. I don't know the reason for this. I would like to hear its cause. The Duke said: The Greater Yang is one of the sons of Yang. Its pulse connects with the Palace of Winds, hence it is the chief of Yang Qi (Vital Energy) in the body. When a person is injured by cold, they become sick with fever. Although the fever may be severe and not lead to death immediately, those who are affected by both cold and heat will inevitably face death.</p>
<p>2: 帝曰：願聞其狀。歧伯曰：傷寒一日，巨陽受之，故頭項痛腰脊強。二日陽明受之，陽明主肉，其脈俠鼻絡於目，故身熱目疼而鼻乾，不得臥也。三日，少陽受之，少陽主膽，其脈循脇絡於耳，故胸脇痛而耳聾。三陽經絡皆受其病，而未入於藏者，故可汗而已。四日，太陰受之，太陰脈布胃中絡於嗌，故腹滿而嗌乾。五日，少陰受之，少陰脈貫腎絡於肺，繫舌本，故口燥舌乾而渴。六日，厥陰受之，厥陰脈循陰器而絡於肝，故煩滿而囊縮。三陰三陽，五藏六府，皆受病，榮衛不行，五藏不通，則死矣。
The Emperor said: I wish to hear about his condition. Tongpbò said: He fell ill on the first day with a cold, and Yáoyáng attacked it. As a result, his head and neck ache, and his back is stiff. On the second day, Yángmíng attacked it, and Yángmíng governs the flesh. His pulse is at the tip of his nose and goes to his eyes, so he has fever in his body and eye pain, and his nose is dry, and he cannot lie down. On the third day, Shàoyáng attacked him, and Shàoyáng governs the liver. His pulse runs along his ribs and goes to his ears, so he has pain in his chest and back and his ears are deafened. All three Yáng meridians were affected by his illness but had not yet entered the viscera, so it stopped at the emperor. On the fourth day, Tàiyīn attacked him, and Tàiyīn's pulse spreads in the stomach cavity and goes to the lips, so he is bloated and his lips are dry. On the fifth day, Shàoyīn attacked him, and Shàoyīn's pulse penetrates the kidneys and goes to the lungs, attaching to the tongue's root, so his mouth is parched, and his tongue is dry, and he is thirsty. On the sixth day, Jūnyáng attacked him, and Jūnyáng's pulse circulates around the yīn organs and goes to the liver, so he is bothered and his swelling. All three Yáng and Shào Yáng, the five viscera and six ministries, were affected by the illness, and the honor guard did not move, and the five viscera could not communicate, so he would die.</p>
<p>3: 其不兩感於寒者，七日巨陽病衰，頭痛少愈；八日，陽明病衰，身熱少愈；九日，少陽病衰，耳聾微聞；十日，太陰病衰，腹減如故，則思飲食；十一日，少陰病衰，渴止不滿，舌乾已而嚏；十二日，厥陰病衰，囊縱少腹微下，大氣皆去，病日已矣。帝曰：治之柰何。歧伯曰：治之各通其藏脈，病日衰已矣。其未滿三日者，可汗而已；其滿三日者，可泄而已。
The person experiencing the symptoms would experience a gradual improvement in their condition. On the seventh day, they would have a high fever due to Jupiter disease and experience headaches that would improve over time. On the eighth day, they would suffer from solar plexus disease, with a high body temperature that would also improve gradually. On the ninth day, they would develop kidney deficiency disease, experiencing partial deafness or difficulty hearing. On the tenth day, they would experience yin deficiency disease, feeling a reduced appetite and abdominal discomfort. On the eleventh day, they would have yin-deficient disease, feeling extremely thirsty but not fully satisfied, with a dry tongue and coughing. On the twelfth day, they would suffer from primordial yin deficiency, experiencing slight swelling in the neck and chest, loss of all qi, and the illness would have run its course. The emperor asked how to treat this disease, and the Duke said that one should treat it by addressing the individual's specific ailment and by attending to their vital energy. If the symptoms lasted less than three days, one could use purgatives; if they lasted for three days or more, one should use diuretics</p>
<p>4: 帝曰：熱病已愈，時有所遺者，何也。歧伯曰：諸遺者，熱甚而強食之，故有所遺也。若此者，皆病已衰，而熱有所藏，因其穀氣相薄，兩熱相合，故有所遺也。帝曰：善。治遺柰何。歧伯曰：視其虛實，調其逆從，可使必已矣。帝曰：病熱當何禁之。歧伯曰：病熱少愈，食肉則復，多食則遺，此其禁也。
The Emperor said: The fever has passed, but there are sometimes remnants. What is the reason for this? Duke Huan replied: Among the remnants, those who have a severe fever and force themselves to eat will experience remnants. If someone in this category, they are already weak from the illness, but their fever still lingers due to the weakness of their vital energy. The hot and cold energies combine, resulting in remnants. Emperor said: Good. How does one treat these remnants? Duke Huan replied: Observe the patient's condition, regulate their excesses and deficiencies, and this will ensure a complete recovery. Emperor said: How should fever be treated? Duke Huan replied: Mild fever can be cured easily, but eating too much meat can cause remnants, so one must be cautious in treating fever.</p>
<p>5: 帝曰：其病兩感於寒者，其脈應與其病形何如。歧伯曰：兩感於寒者，病一日，則巨陽與少陰俱病，則頭痛口乾而煩滿；二日，則陽明與太陰俱病，則腹滿身熱，不欲食譫言；三日，則少陽與厥陰俱病，則耳聾囊縮而厥，水漿不入，不知人，六日死。帝曰：五藏已傷，六府不通，榮衛不行，如是之後，三日乃死，何也。歧伯曰：陽明者，十二經脈之長也，其血氣盛，故不知人，三日其氣乃盡，故死矣。凡病傷寒而成溫者，先夏至日者為病溫，後夏至日者為病暑，暑當與汗皆出，勿止。
Emperor said: What about a patient with two feelings of coldness? How should the pulse correspond to their illness condition? Qi Bo said: A patient with two feelings of coldness, if sick for one day, both Greater Yang and Lesser Yang are affected, resulting in headache and dry mouth; if sick for two days, both Conception Vessel and Governor Vessel are affected, leading to abdominal distension and body heat, without appetite or desire to speak; if sick for three days, both Minor Yang and Major Yin are affected, resulting in deafness, swelling of the cheeks, and difficulty swallowing, with saliva not entering, unable to recognize people, and dying on the sixth day. Emperor said: The Five Organs are injured, the Six Offices are not connected, and the Royal Guards cannot function. How can one die in three days? Qi Bo said: Yang Ming is the long channel among the twelve meridians. Its qi and blood are abundant, so the patient does not recognize people. On the third day, all of their qi is depleted, resulting in death. For any illness caused by cold damage that becomes warm, the peak heat of early summer represents the warmth phase, while the peak heat of late summer represents the heat phase. Sweating should be allowed during both phases and should not be stopped</p>
