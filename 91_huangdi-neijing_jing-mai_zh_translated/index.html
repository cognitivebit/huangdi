<h1 id="_1">經脈</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>雷公問於黃帝曰：「禁脈」之言，凡刺之理，經脈為始，營其所行，制其度量，內次五藏，外別六府，願盡聞其道。
Master Lái asked Emperor Yellow: Regulating the pulse is a topic, in which the theory of needling pertains. The pulse originates the pathway, charts its course, measures it, arranges its internal divisions (the Five Organs) and its external areas (the Six Departments), wishing to hear about its way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：人始生，先成精，精成而腦髓生，骨為幹，脈為營，筋為剛，肉為牆，皮膚堅而毛髮長，穀入于胃，脈道以通，血氣乃行。
The Yellow Emperor said: When a person is first born, they are initially pure. This purity leads to the development of their brain and spinal cord. Their bones serve as the framework, their vessels serve as their territory, their tendons provide strength, their flesh serves as the walls, their skin is firm while their hair and fur grow long. Their grains enter the stomach, their channels circulate throughout, and blood and qi function properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>雷公曰：願卒聞經脈之始生。黃帝曰：經脈者，所以能決死生、處百病、調虛實，不可不通。
Lei Gong said: I wish to hear about the origins of the meridians. Huang Di said: The meridians are what allow us to determine life and death, treat a hundred diseases, and regulate real and fake, and cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>肺手太陰之脈，起於中焦，下絡大腸，還循胃口，上膈屬肺，從肺系橫出腋下，下循臑內，行少陰心主之前，下肘中，循臂內上骨下廉，入寸口，上魚，循魚際，出大指之端；其支者，從腕後直出次指內廉出其端。
The lung channel's conception vessel pulse, originating from the middle burner, passes through the large intestine, ascends along the stomach opening, connects to the lung, exits horizontally from the axilla, descends inside the muscle, proceeds along the small intestine channel, reaches the heart governor's front, descends at the elbow's center, follows the arm's interior along the bone and shin, enters the foot's portal, ascends along the flexor tendon, follows the Achilles tendon, exits at the tip of the great toe; its connecting vessel is from the wrist back, straight out to the side of the ring finger's base.</p>

<p>是動則病肺脹滿，膨脹而喘咳，缺盆中痛，甚則交兩手而瞀，此為臂厥。是主肺所生病者，咳上氣，喘渴，煩心，胸滿，臑臂內前廉痛厥，掌中熱。氣盛有餘，則肩背痛，風寒汗出中風，小便數而欠。氣虛則肩背痛，寒，少氣不足以息，溺色變。為此諸病，盛則寫之，虛則補之，熱則疾之，寒則留之，陷下則灸之，不盛不虛，以經取之。盛者，寸口大三倍於人迎，虛者，則寸口反小於人迎也。
The text describes the symptoms and treatment of a disease affecting the lung, characterized by fullness, wheezing, coughing, pain in the lower abdomen, and other related issues. It also provides instructions for diagnosing and treating the condition based on whether it is excessive or deficient, hot or cold, and whether it has sunk down or not. The text concludes with details about how the pulse at a specific acupuncture point should appear under different circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation: </p>
<p>A disease of lung Qi stagnation presents with fullness and pain, causing bloating and wheezing, accompanied by coughing. There is pain in the lower abdomen, and in severe cases, the patient may clutch their chest and gasp for breath, manifesting as Qi stagnation. This condition affects those with lung disorders. The patient experiences coughing up Qi, shortness of breath, restlessness, fullness in the chest, pain in the inner aspect of the arm, and heat in the palm. If there is an excess of Qi, there will be pain in the shoulders and back, sweating due to wind-heat, and frequent urination with dribbling. If Qi is deficient, there will be pain in the shoulders and back, coldness, and insufficient Qi to dispel pathogens, leading to a changed appearance.</p>
<p>To treat these various illnesses, first determine if they are excessive or deficient, hot or cold, and whether they have sunk down. If there is an excess, the pulse at a specific acupuncture point will be large, three times the size of a normal pulse. If there is a deficiency, the pulse will be smaller than normal. The treatment approach varies depending on whether it is excessive or deficient, hot or cold, and whether it has sunk down or not.</p>

<p>大腸手陽明之脈，起於大指次指之端，循指上廉，出合谷兩骨之間，上入兩筋之中，循臂上廉，入肘外廉，上臑外前廉，上肩，出髃骨之前廉，上出於柱骨之會上，下入缺盆，絡肺，下膈，屬大腸。其支者，從缺盆上頸，貫頰，入下齒中，還出挾口，交人中，左之右，右之左，上挾鼻孔。
The Large Intestine Channel of the Yang Ming meridian begins at the root of the index finger, ascends along the back of the index finger, emerges between the two bones in the crease of the wrist, enters the muscle and rises to the surface, passing over the outer aspect of the elbow, up to the outer aspect of the shoulder, emerging from the front of the mastoid process, exiting at the junction of the axis bone, descending into the hollow of the inguinal ligament, connecting with the lungs, moving downward, it connects with the Conception Vessel and nourishes the large intestine. Its branch (the Channel of the Yang Ming) starts from the inguinal ligament, ascends to the back of the neck, passes through the mouth, exits the throat, crosses in front of the nostrils, left over right, right over left, and ascends to the nasal opening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是動則病齒痛，頸腫。是主津液所生病者，目黃，口乾，鼽衄，喉痺，肩前臑痛，大指次指痛不用，氣有餘則當脈所過者熱腫；虛則寒慄不復。為此諸病，盛則寫之，虛則補之，熱則疾之，寒則留之，陷下則灸之，不盛不虛，以經取之。盛者，人迎大三倍於寸口；虛者，人迎反小於寸口也。
If the condition is caused by movement, there will be toothache and neck swelling. The patient suffers from a disease associated with the production of body fluids and exhibits symptoms such as yellow eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, a sore throat, pain in the shoulder blade, and pain in the second and third fingers that are difficult to use. If there is an excess of Qi, the pulse will be rapid at specific points along the meridian, accompanied by heat and swelling; if there is deficiency, there will be chills and no recovery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For these symptoms, if there is an excess or a deficiency, write down the prescription; if there is heat or cold, act accordingly; if there is stagnation, use acupuncture; and if there is nonexcess or deficiency, apply the meridian points according to the classics. In cases of excess, the patient will be greeted by the Lung, Large Intestine, and Stomach meridians three times as large as the Conception Vessel at the point; in cases of deficiency, the patient will be greeted by the Conception Vessel, which is smaller than the point on the Conception Vessel.</p>

The Pulse: Yangming, also called the Governing Vessel, begins at the intersection of the nostrils. It runs alongside the Great Vessel, descending externally along the nose, entering the upper gum between the lips, emerging below the cheekbone, passing in front of the ear, crossing the temple, and ending at the hairline; its branch is called Jueyin, which originates from the juncture just below the Great Vessel's external end, descends along the throat, enters the hollow under the breast, connecting to the stomach, uniting with the spleen; its direct branch starts from the hollow beneath the breast and descends along the inguinal region, entering the bladder hole, connecting to the diaphragm, relating to the stomach, nourishing the spleen; its branch begins at the end of the stomach, descending through the abdomen, reaching the bladder hole, and merging there, then proceeding down the outer edge of the shin, below the little toe, entering the middle space between the toes; its branch originates from below the ankle, enters the big toe's outer corner and exits.</p>

<p>是動則病洒洒振寒，善呻，數欠，顏黑，病至則惡人與火，聞木聲則惕然而惊，心欲動，獨閉戶塞牖而處。甚則欲上高而歌，棄衣而走，賁嚮腹脹，是為骭厥。是主血所生病者，狂瘧溫淫，汗出，鼽衄，口喎，唇胗，頸腫，喉痺，大腹水腫，膝臏腫痛，循膺乳、氣沖、股、伏兔、骭外廉、足跗上皆痛，中趾不用，氣盛則身以前皆熱，其有餘於胃，則消穀善飢，溺色黃；氣不足則身以前皆寒慄，胃中寒則脹滿。為此諸病，盛則寫之，虛則補之，熱則疾之，寒則留之，陷下則灸之，不盛不虛，以經取之。盛者，人迎大三倍於寸口，虛者，人迎反小於寸口也。
The disease caused by excessive movement is characterized by trembling, shivering, and a pale complexion. As the disease worsens, the patient becomes hostile and uncooperative, jumps at the sound of footsteps, and their heart palpitates. They close themselves in a dark room. In severe cases, they want to climb high and sing, discard their clothes and run around, experiencing abdominal pain and distension, this is called jia yi. This disease is caused by excessive bleeding and is characterized by madness, fever, sweating, bloody discharge, a hoarse voice, swollen lips, sore throat, goiter, and difficulty swallowing. Patients also experience abdominal swelling, knee pain, lower back pain, swelling and pain in the hui, lao, qi, kou, and chen regions, pain in the ankle joints, aching soles of the feet, and the big toe is unable to bear weight. If there is an excess of this condition, patients may have excessive hunger and yellow complexion, or if there is not enough Qi, they will feel cold and tremble, with distension in the abdomen. For these diseases, when there is an excess, you should write down the symptoms, when there is a deficiency, you should supplement it, when there is heat, you should release it, and when there is cold, you should retain it. If the disease sinks down, you should use acupuncture. If there is neither excess nor deficiency, you should treat according to the classical texts. When there is an excess, the patient will present symptoms three times greater than at the guan (governor) vessel point, and when there is a deficiency, the patient will present symptoms smaller than at the guan vessel point.</p>

This passage discusses the diagnosis and treatment of various illnesses in traditional Chinese medicine, based on the condition of the patient's tongue. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation: When there is movement (of the body), it is due to illness of the sinew; when eating, there is vomiting, pain in the abdomen, distension in the belly, burping, and quick recovery after defecation, and the body feels heavy. This pertains to patients with illnesses caused by the spleen. The tongue is painful, the body cannot move freely, and food does not descend. The mind is restless, there is pain below the heart, there is discharge of pus, urinary retention, jaundice, hemorrhoids, and an inability to lie down. When standing, there is swelling and numbness in the groin and knees, and the toes cannot be lifted.</p>
<p>For these illnesses, if they are predominant, write them down; if they are deficient, supplement them; if they are warm, disperse them; if they are cold, retain them; if they have sunken, use acupuncture; if they do not fit any of the above, use the classics. For the predominant ones, the pulse at the right spring (location) is three times larger than that of a normal person; for the deficient ones, it is smaller than that of a normal person.</p>

If there is movement and pain in the tongue, heart palpitations, chest pain, thirst, and a desire to drink, it is due to a weakness of the arm. This pertains to patients with diseases of the heart. The symptoms include yellow eyes, pain behind the navel, pain in the inside of the elbow, pain in the palm, and pain when grasping something. For these diseases, if there is an excess, write about it; if there is a deficiency, supplement it; if there is heat, disperse it; if there is cold, retain it; if it sinks down, use acupuncture; do not have an excess without a deficiency, and take from the meridians according to the Classic of Medicine. If there is an excess, the pulse at the Influential point (LU-1) will be large, double that of a normal person; if there is a deficiency, it will be small compared to a normal person's pulse.</p>

The patient has symptoms of qi stagnation and blood stasis, such as pain in the tongue, swollen throat, difficulty swallowing, shoulder pain similar to pulling, elbow pain similar to bending. The chief manifestations of this disease are tinnitus, deafness, yellow eyes, swelling of the cheek, neck, throat, shoulders, elbows, forearms, and numbness on the outer side of the limbs. For these diseases, one should prescribe according to their predominance; if abundant, record it in the case history, if deficient, supplement it. If there is heat, treat it urgently; if cold, let it be. If it sinks downward, use acupuncture and moxibustion. Do not simply rely on the meridians; take the pulse. When abundant, the pulse at the wrist will be twice as strong as that at the heart position, and when deficient, it will be smaller than that at the heart position.</p>

The condition is caused by overexertion, and presents with headache, dizziness, stiffness in the neck, back pain, painful hips that cannot be flexed, knees that feel like they are locked, and ankles that feel like they are split. This is called Gua disease. It affects those who have illnesses of the sinews, such as boils, furuncles, madness, mania, headaches, aching necks, yellow and watery eyes, nasal discharge, stiffness in the neck, back, hips, waist, knees, ankles, and toes that all hurt, and small toe weakness. For this condition, if it is excessive, write it; if it is deficient, tonify it; if there is heat, expel it; if there is cold, retain it; if it sinks downward, use moxibustion; if it neither excesses nor deficiencies, use acupuncture according to the classics. Excess is when the patient faces the practitioner at a distance twice that of the Cun point, and deficiency is when the patient faces the practitioner at a distance smaller than the Cun point.</p>

When there is movement, it becomes illness due to hunger and lack of appetite, with a pale face like lacquer on tinder. When coughing up sputum, there is blood. Panting after drinking, sitting and wanting to get up, the eyes roll around like seeing nothing, and the heart feels suspended as if in a state of hunger. Insufficient Qi causes one to be easily frightened, with the mind being alert, like someone about to be caught, which is known as Jade Tear. This governs diseases generated by the Kidney, marked by a red tongue, a dry throat, swollen lymph nodes, a sensation of stuffiness in the chest, a dry and painful tongue, restlessness, heart pain, jaundice, abdominal bloating, lower back and inner thigh pain, impotence, liking to lie down, and hot and painful soles of the feet. For these diseases, if there is excess, regulate it; if deficient, supplement it; if there is heat, disperse it; if cold, retain it; if sunken in, apply acupuncture; if not excess or deficiency, use the Meridians. When applying acupuncture, the size of the opening at the Conception Vessel should be doubled in those with excess and half that in those with deficiency.</p>

The condition is due to a hyperactivity of the liver, manifested by redness of the palms, sweating, urgent and painful movements of the arms, swelling in the armpits, such that the chest feels supported, filled, and the heart is beating violently. The face turns red and the eyes yellow; they laugh uncontrollably.
For this condition, if it predominates (i.e., the liver), then write it down. If it's deficient, then supplement. If there's heat, use an expeditious treatment. If there's cold, retain it. If it sinks downward, then use cupping therapy. If it isn't predominant or deficient, use the meridian and apply the classical text.
When it predominates, the inch point is larger than a person's embrace; when it's deficient, the inch point is smaller than a person's embrace.</p>

The text states that certain conditions arise from the movement of qi, such as deafness and dizziness. This is a disease caused by qi imbalance. Symptoms include sweating, sharp pain in the eyes, facial pain, pain in the ears, shoulders, chest, elbows, forearms, and the sides of the small and index fingers. The treatment approach involves regulating the balance between excess and deficiency, using acupuncture for sinking conditions, and adapting techniques based on whether the condition is due to heat or cold. If the qi is in excess or deficient, the treatment will be adjusted according to the principles of the meridians. When there is an excess of qi, it manifests as a person standing upright with their hands outstretched at the Large Intestine (Lung) position, and when there is a deficiency, it manifests as their hands being pulled in close to the body, smaller than the Inception (Conception) position.</p>

The text is written in literary Chinese, which is a type of classical Chinese used in ancient texts and literature. The translation of this particular passage into English would be:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Symptoms arise due to the movement, pain at the mouth, shallow breathing, unable to turn over, sometimes with a little dirt on the face, body without sweat, feet hot outside, this is called Yang deficiency. It governs diseases arising from bones, headache, jaw pain, eye pain, pubic pain due to swelling, groin swelling, hip pain, knee pain, ankle pain, heel pain, toe pain, not being able to use the toes. If these diseases are abundant, record them; if they are scarce, supplement them; if there is heat, resolve it; if there is cold, retain it; if sinking, use cupping; if not abundant nor deficient, rely on the meridians. Abundance refers to the person standing facing the great yin (or a position where the large intestine point is 1 cun larger than the governing vessel point), and deficiency refers to the person standing facing the small yang (or a position where the governing vessel point is smaller than the large intestine point).</p>
<ol>

<p>肝足厥陰之脈，起於大趾叢毛之際，上循足跗上廉，去內踝一寸，上踝八寸，交出太陰之後，上膕內廉，循股陰，入毛中，過陰器，抵小腹，挾胃，屬肝，絡膽，上貫膈，布脅肋，循喉嚨之後，上入頏顙，連目系，上出額，與督脈會於巔；其支者，從目系下頰裏，環唇內；其支者，復從肝，別貫膈，上注肺。
The radialis minor pulse, which governs the kidney and influences the yin, arises at the intersection of the thick hair on the great toe. It rises along the inner side of the foot to the ankle joint, then ascends eight cun (approximately 12 cm or 4.7 inches) beyond it to reach the junction of the conception vessel and the governing vessel. Rising inside the inguinal ring, it follows the yin hollow of the thigh, enters the hairy region, passes in front of the genitals, strikes the small abdomen, embraces the stomach, belongs to the liver, unites with the gallbladder, ascends through the uterus, spreads over the costal margins, and follows the back of the throat. Then it enters the chin and joins with the governor vessel at the apex; its branches extend downward from the junction of the governing and conception vessels to encompass the eyes and ascend again to the lips. Another branch departs from the liver, separates from the conduit vessel, and ascends to the lung.</p>

<li>
<p>是動則病腰痛不可以俛仰，丈夫㿉疝，婦人少腹腫，甚則嗌乾，面塵，脫色。是肝所生病者，胸滿，嘔逆，飧泄，狐疝，遺溺，閉癃。為此諸病，盛則寫之，虛則補之，熱則疾之，寒則留之，陷下則灸之，不盛不虛，以經取之。盛者，寸口大一倍於人迎，虛者，寸口反小於人迎也。
If there is movement, it will result in pain in the waist; a man will have groin pain, and a woman may have abdominal distension, with symptoms such as dryness of the vagina, dusty face, and pallor. This is due to disease arising from the liver. Symptoms include fullness in the chest, nausea rising to the throat, vomiting, hiccups, pain in the hips and loins, dizziness, and deafness. For these diseases, if they are abundant, treat with bloodletting; if they are deficient, use tonics; if there is heat, use quick-acting medicines; if there is cold, use warm medicines; for those who have sunken pulse, use acupuncture; and do not apply bloodletting or tonics based on the pulse. When there is abundance, the pulsation at the wrist is larger than a normal embrace, and when there is deficiency, it is smaller than a normal embrace.</p>

<p>手太陰氣絕，則皮毛焦。太陰者，行氣溫於皮毛者也。故氣不榮，則皮毛焦；皮毛焦，則津液去皮節；津液去皮節者，則爪枯毛折；毛折者，則毛先死。丙篤丁死，火勝金也。
If yin energy is deficient, the skin and hair will become dry. Yin energy controls the warmth of the skin and hair. Therefore, if there is a lack of Qi, the skin and hair will become dry; when the skin and hair are dry, the body fluids will evaporate from the surface of the skin and muscles; when the body fluids have evaporated from the skin and muscles, the nails and hair will become withered; when the hair has withered, it will die first. Wood conquers Earth in the Pentad cycle</p>

<li>
<p>手少陰氣絕，則脈不通；脈不通，則血不流；血不流，則髮色不澤，故其面黑如漆柴者，血先死。壬篤癸死，水勝火也。
If one's hand has few fingers and the yin qi is absent, then the pulse will not be transmitted; if the pulse is not transmitted, then the blood will not flow; if the blood does not flow, then the hair color will not flourish, hence his face is black like lacquer, and blood dies first. In the year of Ren Tou Gui, Keng Die, blood wins over fire, water triumphs over fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>足太陰氣絕者，則脈不榮肌肉。唇舌者，肌肉之本也。脈不榮，則肌肉軟；肌肉軟，則舌萎人中滿；人中滿，則唇反；唇反者，肉先死。甲篤乙死，木勝土也。
When the essence of the foot yin is exhausted, then the pulse will not nourish the muscles. The lips and tongue belong to the muscles. If the pulse does not nourish the muscles, they become soft; if the muscles are soft, the tongue becomes weak and one has difficulty speaking; when one has difficulty speaking, the lips turn inside out; turning the lips inside out is a sign of muscle death. Wood overpowers earth in the sequence of the five elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>足少陰氣絕，則骨枯。少陰者，冬脈也，伏行而濡骨髓者也，故骨不濡，則肉不能著也；骨肉不相親，則肉軟卻；肉軟卻，故齒長而垢，髮無澤；髮無澤者，骨先死。戊篤己死，土勝水也。
If there is not enough yin qi, the bones will become dry. Yin refers to the kidney meridian, which nourishes and moistens the bone marrow; thus if it does not moisten, the flesh cannot be nourished either. When the flesh is not nourished, it becomes soft and weak. Soft and weak flesh results in long teeth and dirt accumulation, while hair loses its luster. Hair without luster indicates that the bones will die first. In the cycle of the Five Elements, Earth overcomes Water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>足厥陰氣絕，則筋絕。厥陰者，肝脈也，肝者，筋之合也，筋者，聚於陰氣，而脈絡於舌本也。故脈弗榮，則筋急；筋急則引舌與卵，故唇青舌卷卵縮，則筋先死。庚篤辛死，金勝木也。
When yin qi is exhausted, the sinews will be severed. Yin qi refers to the liver meridian, the liver governs the sinew's unification, and the sinew gathers at the yin qi, while the channels are rooted in the tongue by nature. Thus, if the channels are not honored, the sinews will become tight; when the sinews become tight, they will pull the tongue and the egg, leading to the lips turning purple, the tongue rolling up the egg, and the tongue contracting; the sinews will die first. In the year of Pig, Wood is defeated by Fire, while Metal triumphs over Wood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>五陰氣俱絕，則目系轉，轉則目運；目運者，為志先死；志先死，則遠一日半死矣。六陽氣絕，則陰與陽相離，離則腠理發泄，絕汗乃出，故旦占夕死，夕占旦死。
When the five yin energies are all absent, the eyes will be turned, and when they are turned, the gaze will be fixed; the gaze being fixed is a sign of determination to die. Determination to die means one is close to death for half a day. When the six yang energies are absent, yin and yang become separated, leading to the release of the sinews and orifices, causing sweating to occur. This is why daily death predictions and nighttime death predictions alternate.</p>

<li>
<p>經脈十二者，伏行分肉之間，深而不見；其常見者，足太陰過於外踝之上，無所隱故也。諸脈之浮而常見者，皆絡脈也。六經絡，手陽明少陽之大絡，起於五指間，上合肘中。飲酒者，衛氣先行皮膚，先充絡脈，絡脈先盛。故衛氣已平，營氣乃滿，而經脈大盛。脈之卒然動者，皆邪氣居之，留於本末，不動則熱，不堅則陷且空，不與眾同，是以知其何脈之動也。
The twelve channels are hidden, moving between the muscles, deep and not visible; those who often see them, there is a foot Taiyin passing above the outer toe without any hiding. All the floating channels that are often seen are the Luo channels. The six Luo channels, from Hand Yangming and Shaoyang's great Luo, originate in the space between the five fingers and join at the elbow. When drinking alcohol, Wei Qi goes first through the skin, fills the Luo channel first, and the Luo channel fills up first. Therefore, when Wei Qi is balanced, Ying Qi is full, and the meridians are abundant. The movement of the pulse at a crucial moment is always due to evil Qi residing there, staying at both the beginning and end, not moving, so it is hot but not firm, prone to sink and be empty, not mixing with others, which allows one to know which meridian's pulse is moving.</p>

<p>雷公曰：何以知經脈之與絡脈異也？黃帝曰：經脈者，常不可見也，其虛實也，以氣口知之。脈之見者，皆絡脈也。
Master Lái asked: How do we know the difference between the regular pulse and the knotted pulse? Yellow Emperor answered: The regular pulse is always invisible, being both virtual and real, it can be known through its manifestations of Qi from the mouth. Those who can see the pulse are all experiencing a knotted pulse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>雷公曰：細子無以明其然也。黃帝曰：諸絡脈皆不能經大節之間，必行絕道而出入，復合於皮中，其會皆見於外。故諸刺絡脈者，必刺其結上甚血者。雖無結，急取之，以寫其邪而出其血。留之發為痺也。凡診絡脈，脈色青，則寒，且痛；赤則有熱。胃中寒，手魚之絡多青矣；胃中有熱，魚際絡赤。其暴黑者，留久痺也。其有赤、有黑、有青者，寒熱氣也。其青短者，少氣也。凡刺寒熱者，皆多血絡，必間日而一取之，血盡而止，乃調其虛實。其小而短者，少氣，甚者，寫之則悶，悶甚則仆，不得言，悶則急坐之也。
Master Lái said: A needle cannot reveal the truth of a channel clearly. Emperor Hóu said: All the channels cannot circulate freely through the large joints, so they must go along the small channels and come in and out through the skin; all of these are seen on the outside. Therefore, when piercing the channels, one must pierce where there is much bleeding and urgency to expel the evil and let blood out. Leaving it will lead to swelling. In general, when diagnosing the channels, if the pulse is greenish-blue, it indicates coldness and pain; if red, it indicates heat. Channels in the stomach area often have a greenish-blue hue when there is coldness inside; when there is heat within, the extremity of the channels will be red. If they are extremely black, leaving them for too long can lead to swelling. Red, black, and green indicate the presence of cold and hot energies. Short green indicates a deficiency of energy. In general, when piercing cold and heat, one must repeatedly take blood from them every day, until the blood has all stopped flowing and then it will regulate the emptiness and reality. When they are small and short, there is a deficiency of energy; if severe, writing it out can cause weakness, severe weakness can lead to unconsciousness, and being unable to speak; weakness leads to sitting down in urgency, and not being able to stand up.</p>

The separate channel of the Shu (lateral) vessel is called Lěi Qiāng. It begins at the wrist crease and runs along with the Shu vessel, passing into the palm directly and dispersing into the finger tips. Its true manifestation is sharpness and warmth in the hand; its deficiency is numbness of the hand, and incontinence of urine. It ends at the wrist joint. It separates from the Yang Ming (Great Brightness) channel.</p>
