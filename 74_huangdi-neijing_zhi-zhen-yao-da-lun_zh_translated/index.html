<h1 id="_1">至真要大論</h1>
<ol>
<li>黃帝問曰：五氣交合，盈虛更作，余知之矣。六氣分治，司天地者，其至何如。歧伯再拜對曰：明乎哉問也。天地之大紀，人神之通應也。帝曰：願聞上合昭昭，下合冥冥，柰何。歧伯曰：此道之所主，工之所疑也。帝曰：願聞其道也。歧伯曰：厥陰司天，其化以風，少陰司天，其化以熱，太陰司天，其化以濕，少陽司天，其化以火，陽明司天，其化以燥，太陽司天，其化以寒，以所臨藏位，命其病者也。帝曰：地化柰何。歧伯曰：司天同候，間氣皆然。帝曰：間氣何謂。歧伯曰：司左右者，是謂間氣也。帝曰：何以異之。歧伯曰：主歲者紀歲，間氣者紀步也。帝曰：善。歲主奈何。歧伯曰：厥陰司天為風化，在泉為酸化，司氣為蒼化，閒氣為動化。少陰司天為熱化，在泉為苦化，不司氣化，居氣為灼化。太陰司天為濕化，在泉為甘化，司氣為黅化，閒氣為柔化。少陽司天為火化，在泉為苦化，司氣為丹化，間氣為明化。陽明司天為燥化，在泉為辛化，司氣為素化，間氣為清化。太陽司天為寒化，在泉為鹹化，司氣為玄化，間氣為藏化。故治病者，必明六化分治，五味五色所生，五藏所宜，迺可以言盈虛病生之緒也。
Emperor asked: When the five energies are unified, and yin and yang are further balanced, I am already aware of this. But how can the six energies be separated and governed, those who govern heaven and earth, how is it done? </li>
</ol>
<p>Huo Bo bowed again in response and said, It is truly a profound question. The order of heaven and the connection between humans and spirits are manifested through this. Emperor asked: I wish to hear about the great harmony above and the harmony below. Ho Bo replied: This path is what the wise follow, and what causes confusion for craftsmen. Emperor asked: I wish to hear about its way. </p>
<p>Huo Bo said: The Excessive Yin governs heaven, its transformation manifests as wind; the Lesser Yin governs heaven, its transformation manifests as heat; the Yin of heaven governs heaven, its transformation manifests as dampness; the Shao Yang governs heaven, its transformation manifests as fire; the Yang Ming governs heaven, its transformation manifests as aridity; and the Greater Yang governs heaven, its transformation manifests as cold. Emperor asked: How about the transformation of earth? </p>
<p>Huo Bo replied: The governance of heaven and earth is the same in terms of timing, and all intermediate energies are also timed accordingly. Emperor asked: What are these intermediate energies? Huo Bo replied: Those who govern left and right are referred to as intermediate energies. Emperor asked: How are they different? </p>
<p>Huo Bo said: The Master of the season governs according to the season, and the intermediate energies govern according to steps. Emperor asked: That is good. How should one handle being the Master of the season? </p>
<p>Huo Bo replied: The Excessive Yin governs heaven as wind, resides in the wells as an acidic influence; the Lesser Yin governs heaven as heat, does not reside in the wells but governs as a scorching influence; the Yin of heaven governs heaven as dampness, resides in the wells as a sweet influence; the Shao Yang governs heaven as fire, resides in the wells as a bright influence; the Yang Ming governs heaven as aridity, resides in the wells as a bitter influence; the Greater Yang governs heaven as cold, resides in the wells as a salty influence. Therefore, to treat diseases, one must clearly understand the six transformations and their divisions, and the flavors and colors that give rise to the five organs. This is already enough to describe the cause of yin and yang imbalance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>帝曰：厥陰在泉而酸化，先余知之矣。風化之行也何如。歧伯曰：風行于地，所謂本也，餘氣同法。本乎天者，天之氣也，本乎地者，地之氣也，天地合氣，六節分而萬物化生矣。故曰：謹候氣宜，無失病機，此之謂也。帝曰：其主病何如。歧伯曰：司歲備物，則無遺主矣。帝曰：先歲物何也。歧伯曰：天地之專精也。帝曰：司氣者何如。歧伯曰：司氣者主歲同，然有餘不足也。帝曰：非司歲物何謂也。歧伯曰：散也，故質同而異等也，氣味有薄厚，性用有躁靜，治保有多少，力化有淺深，此之謂也。帝曰：歲主藏害何謂。歧伯曰：以所不勝命之則其要也。帝曰：治之柰何。歧伯曰：上淫于下，所勝平之，外淫于內，所勝治之。帝曰：善。平氣何如。歧伯曰：謹察陰陽所在而調之，以平為期，正者正治，反者反治。
The Emperor said: The Yin Qi is located at the source and becomes acidic. I have known this for a long time. What about the movement of the Qi in the transformation? Duke said: The Qi moves on the ground, which is the foundation, and the remaining Qi follows the same principle. Originating from heaven, it is heavenly Qi; originating from the earth, it is earthly Qi. When the Qi of heaven and earth are combined, they divide into six departments and give birth to myriad things. Therefore, it is said that being cautious about the Qi is appropriate, without missing any opportunities for recovery. The Emperor said: How does one deal with the illness? Duke said: Preparing for the season and stockpiling supplies will ensure there are no lingering diseases. The Emperor said: What are seasonal supplies? Duke said: They are the essence of heaven and earth. The Emperor said: How should I manage the Qi? Duke said: Managing the Qi is similar to managing the seasons, but it involves a surplus or deficit. The Emperor said: What does not managing the seasonal supplies mean? Duke said: Scattered, so although they have the same essence, they are different in degree, with flavors of thin and thick, uses of agitated and quiet, treatments with more or less, and transformations with shallow and deep, this is what he meant. The Emperor said: What does the seasonal lord hide? Duke said: It hides the things one cannot overcome by willpower. The Emperor said: How do I treat it? Duke said: Control the excess in the lower part, and control the treatment in the upper part, to restore balance. The Emperor said: Good. Balancing the Qi is what? Duke said: Cautiously observe the location of Yin and Yang and adjust them accordingly, with a goal of balancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：夫子言察陰陽所在而調之，論言人迎與寸口相應，若引繩小大齊等，命曰平，陰之所在寸口何如。歧伯曰：視歲南北，可知之矣。帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯曰：北政之歲，少陰在泉，則寸口不應，厥陰在泉，則右不應，太陰在泉，則左不應。南政之歲，少陰司天，則寸口不應，厥陰司天，則右不應，太陰司天，則左不應。諸不應者，反其診則見矣。帝曰：尺候何如。歧伯曰：北政之歲，三陰在下，則寸不應，三陰在上，則尺不應。南政之歲，三陰在天，則寸不應，三陰在泉，則尺不應，左右同。故曰：知其要者，一言而終，不知其要，流散無窮，此之謂也。
The emperor said: Zhongni spoke of understanding the location and adjusting yin and yang, discussing how speech meets response and corresponds with a single hair's breadth. If one extends the string big or small equally, he calls it level. Where is the location of yin? Boyi said: By observing the cycle of north and south, it can be known. The emperor said: I wish to hear more about this. Boyi said: In the season of northern politics, lesser yin is at the well, so the left should not respond; greater yin is at the well, so the right should not respond; greater yin is at the well, so the left should not respond. In the season of southern politics, lesser yin governs heaven, so the left should not respond; greater yin governs heaven, so the right should not respond; greater yin governs heaven, so the left should not respond. All the ones that should not respond can be seen by reversing their diagnosis. The emperor said: What about the foot measure? Boyi said: In the season of northern politics, three yin are below, so the left should not respond; three yin are above, so the foot measure should not respond. In the season of southern politics, three yin are in heaven, so the left should not respond; three yin are at the well, so the foot measure should not respond, as for left and right it is the same. Therefore, he said: Knowing its essence allows one to speak with brevity, while those who do not know its essence are scattered without end. This is what I mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。天地之氣，內淫而病何如。歧伯曰：歲厥陰在泉，風淫所勝，則地氣不明，平野昧，草迺早秀，民病洒洒振寒，善伸數欠，心痛支滿，兩脇裏急，飲食不下，鬲咽不通，食則嘔，腹脹善噫，得後與氣，則快然如衰，身體皆重。歲少陰在泉，熱淫所勝，則焰浮川澤，陰處反明，民病腹中常鳴，氣上衝胸，喘不能久立，寒熱皮膚痛，目瞑齒痛䪼腫，惡寒發熱如瘧，少腹中痛腹大，蟄蟲不藏。歲太陰在泉，草迺早榮，濕淫所勝，則埃昏巖谷黃反見黑，至陰之交民病飲積心痛耳聾，渾渾焞焞，嗌腫喉痺，陰病血見，少腹痛腫，不得小便，病衝頭痛，目似脫，項似拔，腰似折，髀不可以回，膕如結，腨如別。歲少陽在泉，火淫所勝，則焰明郊野，寒熱更至，民病注泄赤白，少腹痛溺赤，甚則血便，少陰同候。歲陽明在泉，燥淫所勝，則霿霧清暝，民病喜嘔，嘔有苦善大息，心脅痛不能反側，甚則嗌乾面塵，身無膏澤，足外反熱。歲太陽在泉，寒淫所勝則凝肅慘慄，民病少腹控睾，引腰脊上衝心痛，血見，嗌痛頷腫。帝曰：善。治之柰何。歧伯曰：諸氣在泉，風淫于內，治以辛涼，佐以苦，以甘緩之，以辛散之。熱淫于內，治以鹹寒，佐以甘苦，以酸收之，以苦發之。濕淫于內，治以苦熱，佐以酸淡，以苦燥之，以淡泄之。火淫于內，治以鹹冷，佐以苦辛，以酸收之，以苦發之。燥淫于內，治以苦溫，佐以甘辛，以苦下之。寒淫于內，治以甘熱，佐以苦辛，以鹹寫之，以辛潤之，以苦堅之。
Emperor: Good. How would the vital energy in Heaven and Earth be affected if the interior was overheated? 
Zhouyi replied: If Yin prevails during a year of excess, the land's Qi will not be clear, the plains will be dull, the grasses and herbs will sprout early, the people will suffer from chills, their tendons will be weak, hearts will hurt, sides will feel heavy, they will have difficulty swallowing food, throats will be constricted, if they eat, they will vomit, bellies will bloat and burp loudly, upon defecation, their lower back will ache like an old man, and their bodies will become heavy. 
If Yang prevails during a year of excess, the flames will rise in rivers and lakes, the Yin areas will be clearly defined, people will suffer from abdominal pains that resonate constantly, Qi will invade the chest, causing shortness of breath and difficulty standing for long periods, chills and rashes will cause pain in teeth, eyes, and testicles, fever will arise like measles, lower abdomen will ache and distend, insects will not hide, menstruation will be blocked. 
If Taiyin prevails during a year of excess, grasses and herbs will sprout early, dampness will prevail, causing the areas to become foggy, blackened, and visible, at the junctions of Yin, people will suffer from retained food and deafness, with flames flickering, red and sore, lower abdomen will ache and distend, they will not be able to urinate, heads will ache as if pulled, necks will ache like a limb that has been wrenched, waists will ache as if broken, thighs will not bend properly, butts will be knotted and hips will feel separated. 
If Shaoyang prevails during a year of excess, flames will shine on the outskirts, chills and fevers will be more intense, people will suffer from bloody discharge and diarrhea, lower abdomen will ache and bleed, if it is extreme, there will be blood in their urine, Shaoyin and Shaoyang will both suffer. 
Emperor: Good. How should they be treated? 
Zhouyi replied: Regulate the Qi at its source, assist with bitter flavors, use sweet ones to calm, disperse with pungent, treat with acrid herbs. For excess internal heat, regulate with salty and cold, assist with sweet and bitter, clear with sour, release with bitter. For excess internal dampness, regulate with bitter and warm, assist with sour and astringent, dry with bitter, eliminate with astringent. For excess internal fire, regulate with salty and cool, assist with sweet and bitter, clear with sour, release with bitter. For excess internal heat, regulate with sweet and warm, assist with bitter and cold, clear with salty, moisten with mucilage, make firm with bitter.</p>

Emperor: Good. What is the nature of the changes in weather? Qi Bo: The Yin and Yang forces are out of balance, leading to various ailments. In the case of too much Yin, it leads to heat and drought, causing discomfort and illnesses such as heatstroke, joint pain, and skin rashes. In the case of too much Yang, it leads to excessive heat and fire, causing diseases such as fever, chills, and diarrhea. The treatment for these imbalances involves using herbs and acupuncture to restore balance between Yin and Yang, cooling or warming the body, and addressing specific symptoms.</p>

The emperor asked, What about the six qi conditions? Q Boya replied, Indeed, this is a difficult question. The deficiency of Yin leads to symptoms such as lower abdominal pain and cramping, acute pain and stabbing sensations in the chest, sweating and vomiting, loss of appetite, and food not entering the stomach, which then comes back out. This can lead to severe cases of affecting the spleen and causing distention and fullness in the abdomen. The Yang excess leads to internal heat, restlessness, lower abdominal pain, tongue symptoms, and mouth ulcers. There is excessive sweating, the skin feels itchy and painful, fever and thirst, body aches, and painful swelling of the limbs. Severe cases can lead to affecting the lungs and causing shortness of breath. The deficiency of Shao Yin leads to symptoms such as internal heat, restlessness, irritability, lower abdominal pain, red tongue with dry yellow coating, excessive sweating, and thirst. Severe cases can lead to affecting the kidneys and causing tinnitus. The excess of Tai Yang leads to symptoms such as internal heat and swelling, body aches, restlessness, irritability, inability to lie down, coughing with wheezing, nasal congestion, a red tongue with yellow coating, and thick sticky saliva. Severe cases can lead to affecting the lungs and causing cough with copious amounts of bloody sputum. The deficiency of Tai Yin leads to symptoms such as dampness and fullness in the body, difficulty digesting food and drinks, rising Yin to the head, hiccups accompanied by clear saliva, symptoms worsening during rainy days, skin lesions, severe headaches with dizziness, and vomiting of clear fluids. Severe cases can lead to affecting the bladder and causing incontinence of urine. The excess of Shao Yang leads to symptoms such as approaching internal heat, dryness and damage to the lips and tongue, restlessness and a feeling of suffocation, chest pain, heart palpitations, irritability, aversion to wind, rising Yin to the head, vomiting and clear saliva. Severe cases can lead to affecting the lungs and causing cough with blood-streaked sputum. The excess of Yang Ming leads to symptoms such as internal heat, fever, thirst, a red tongue with yellow coating, stomach pain and distention, headache, dizziness, difficulty eating, lower back and abdominal pain, leg cramps and restlessness, and thick sticky saliva. Severe cases can lead to affecting the liver and causing sudden jolts of pain. The emperor said, Good. How should one treat these conditions? Q Boya replied, For the deficiency of Yin, treatment involves using cool and cold herbs, supplemented by sweet and bitter herbs. To disperse, use cool and cold herbs; to tonify, use sweet and bitter herbs. For the deficiency of Shao Yin, treatment involves using cold and bitter herbs, supplemented by pungent and warm herbs. To disperse, use cold and bitter herbs; to tonify, use sour herbs; to promote sweating, use pungent and bitter herbs; to dry up dampness, use salty herbs. For the deficiency of Tai Yin, treatment involves using bitter and warm herbs, supplemented by sour and cool herbs. To disperse, use bitter and warm herbs; to dry up, use sour and cool herbs; to promote sweating, use pungent and bitter herbs; to tonify, use salty herbs. For the excess of Shao Yang, treatment involves using salty and cold herbs, supplemented by sweet and bitter herbs. To disperse, use salty and cold herbs; to dry up, use sweet and bitter herbs.

<p>帝曰；善。氣之上下，何謂也。歧伯曰：身半以上，其氣三矣，天之分也，天氣主之。身半以下，其氣三矣，地之分也，地氣主之。以名命氣，以氣命處，而言其病，半所謂天樞也。故上勝而下俱病者，以地名之，下勝而上俱病者，以天名之。所謂勝至報氣，屈伏而未發也，復至則不以天地異名，皆如復氣為法也。
The Emperor said, What is the meaning of 'above and below'? Qi Bo replied, From the waist up, there are three spirits, which are Heaven's portion; Heaven governs these spirits. From the waist down, there are also three spirits, which are Earth's portion; Earth governs these spirits. Naming and commanding the spirits, determining their locations, and speaking of their illnesses, refer to the celestial pivot. Therefore, if one above is victorious while both are sick below, they are called by the name of Earth; if one below is victorious while both are sick above, they are called by the name of Heaven. The so-called victory and retribution of Qi, being bent and not yet manifested, will eventually be without distinction between Heaven and Earth, just like returning to the spirits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：勝復之動，時有常乎，氣有必乎。歧伯曰：時有常位，而氣無必也。帝曰：願聞其道也。歧伯曰：初氣終三氣，天氣主之，勝之常也。四氣盡終氣，地氣主之，復之常也。有勝則復，無勝則否。帝曰：善。復已而勝何如。歧伯曰：勝至則復，無常數也，衰乃止耳。復已而勝，不復則害，此傷生也。帝曰：復而反病何也。歧伯曰：居非其位，不相得也，大復其勝則主勝之，故反病也，所謂火燥熱也。帝曰：治之何如。歧伯曰：夫氣之勝也，微者隨之，甚者制之，氣之復也，和者平之，暴者奪之，皆隨勝氣，安其屈伏，無問其數，以平為期，此其道也。
The Emperor said: The motion of victory and defeat has its time, and there is a necessity to it. Duke Mu said: There is a time for victory and defeat, but there is no necessity in the energy. The Emperor said: I wish to hear of its method. Duke Mu said: With the initial energy, it ends at three energies; Heaven rules the energy of victory, and it is constant. When the four energies are completely exhausted, Earth rules the energy of recovery, which is also constant. If there is a victory, then there will be a recovery; without a victory, there will be an end. The Emperor said: Good. After recovering, what is the state of victory? Duke Mu said: A complete victory brings about recovery, which is without constant numbers, and decay comes to a halt. After recovering and not returning to victory, it becomes a harm, which is a damage to life. The Emperor said: If it reverses and causes illness, why is that? Duke Mu said: Staying away from its position, it does not harmonize, so when the energy of victory is greatly in control, it causes illness, such as excessive heat and fever. The Emperor said: How should it be treated? Duke Mu said: Regarding the energy of victory, follow it gently, and restrain it when it is too much; regarding the energy of recovery, make it even and flat when it is rough, and seize it when it is violent. All follow the energy of victory, secure its bending and submission, without asking about numbers, and make stability the goal - this is its method.</p>

<p>帝曰：善。客主之勝復柰何。歧伯曰：客主之氣，勝而無復也。帝曰：其逆從何如。歧伯曰：主勝逆，客勝從，天之道也。帝曰：其生病何如。歧伯曰：厥陰司天，客勝則耳鳴掉眩，甚則欬，主勝則胸脇痛，舌難以言。少陰司天，客勝則鼽嚏頸項強，肩背瞀熱，頭痛少氣發熱耳聾目瞑，甚則胕腫血溢，瘡瘍欬喘，主勝則心熱煩躁，甚則脇痛支滿。太陰司天，客勝則首面胕腫，呼吸氣喘，主勝則胸腹滿，食已而瞀。少陽司天，客勝則丹胗外發，及為丹熛瘡瘍，嘔逆喉痺，頭痛嗌腫，耳聾血溢，內為瘛瘲，主勝則胸滿欬仰息，甚而有血，手熱。陽明司天，清復內餘，則欬衂嗌塞，心鬲中熱，欬不止而白血出者死。太陽司天，客勝則胸中不利，出清涕感寒則欬，主勝則喉嗌中鳴。厥陰在泉，客勝則大關節不利，內為痙強拘瘛，外為不便，主勝則筋骨繇併，腰腹時痛。少陰在泉，客勝則腰痛尻股膝髀腨䯒足病，瞀熱以酸，胕腫不能久立，溲便變，主勝則厥氣上行，心痛發熱，鬲中眾痺皆作，發於胠脇魄汗不藏，四逆而起。太陰在泉，客勝則足痿下重，便溲不時，濕客下焦，發而濡寫，及為腫隱曲之疾，主勝則寒氣逆滿，食飲不下，甚則為疝。少陽在泉，客勝則腰腹痛而反惡寒，甚則下白溺白，主勝則熱反上行而客於心，心痛發熱，格中而嘔，少陰同候。陽明在泉，客勝則清氣動下，少腹堅滿而數便寫，主勝則腰重腹痛，少腹生寒下為鶩溏，則寒厥於腸，上衝胸中，甚則喘不能久立。太陽在泉，寒復內餘，則腰尻痛屈伸不利，股脛足膝中痛。帝曰：善。治之柰何。歧伯曰：高者抑之，下者舉之，有餘折之，不足補之，佐以所利，和以所宜，必安其主客，適其寒溫，同者逆之，異者從之。帝曰：治寒以熱，治熱以寒，氣相得者逆之，不相得者從之，余以知之矣。其於正味何如。歧伯曰：木位之主，其寫以酸，其補以辛。火位之主，其寫以甘，其補以鹹。土位之主，其寫以苦，其補以甘。金位之主，其寫以辛，其補以酸。水位之主，其寫以鹹，其補以苦。厥陰之客，以辛補之，以酸寫之，以甘緩之。少陰之客，以鹹補之，以甘寫之，以鹹收之。太陰之客，以甘補之，以苦寫之，以甘緩之。少陽之客，以鹹補之，以甘寫之，以鹹耎之。陽明之客，以酸補之，以辛寫之，以苦泄之。太陽之客，以苦補之，以鹹寫之，以苦堅之，以辛潤之，開發腠理，致津液通氣也。
Empire: The emperor is asking about the relationship between victory and defeat in terms of yin and yang, as well as the manifestation of different kinds of disease depending on which is victorious. He also asks for treatment advice from Master Qi Bo.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation: Emperor said: Good. Asking about the relationship between victory and defeat for guest officials. Qi Bo replied: The power of the guest official, when victorious, has no balance. Emperor said: What is the order of defeating? Qi Bo replied: The master wins inferior, raise it; more than enough, cut it; not enough, supplement it; help according to what is advantageous and harmonize according to what is suitable. Adjust the guest official and adapt to the cold and heat; straighten those that are opposite and follow those that are alike. Emperor said: Good. Asking about treating cold and heat, he replied: Wood position master, their vomiting with sourness, their supplementation with pungent. Fire position master, their vomiting with sweetness, their supplementation with salty. Earth position master, their vomiting with bitterness, their supplementation with sweet. Metal position master, their vomiting with pungent, their supplementation with sour. Water position master, their vomiting with salty, their supplementation with bitter. Qi Bo said: As for the guest of yin, use pungent to supplement and use sour to vomit, moderate it. The guest of yang, use salty to supplement and use sour to vomit, use salty to purge.</p>

<p>帝曰：善。願聞陰陽之三也何謂。歧伯曰：氣有多少，異用也。帝曰：陽明何謂也。歧伯曰：兩陽合明也。帝曰：厥陰何也。歧伯曰：兩陰交盡也。帝曰：氣有多少，病有盛衰，治有緩急，方有大小，願聞其約柰何。歧伯曰：氣有高下，病有遠近，證有中外，治有輕重，適其至所為故也。《大要》曰：君一臣二，奇之制也，君二臣四，偶之制也，君二臣三，奇之制也，君二臣六，偶之制也。故曰：近者奇之，遠者偶之，汗者不以奇，下者不以偶，補上治上，制以緩，補下治下，制以急，急則氣味厚，緩則氣味薄，適其至所，此之謂也。病所遠，而中道氣味之者食而過之，無越其制度也。是故平氣之道，近而奇偶，制小其服也。遠而奇偶，制大其服也。大則數少，小則數多。多則九之，少則二之。奇之不去則偶之，是謂重方。偶之不去，則反佐以取之，所謂寒熱溫涼反從其病也。帝曰：善。病生於本，余知之矣。生於標者，治之柰何。歧伯曰：病反其本，得標之病，治反其本，得標之方。
Emperor: Good. I wish to hear about the three aspects of Yin and Yang. Lord Huan replied: There is much Qi, and different uses. Emperor: What do you mean by Yang being bright? Lord Huan replied: When two Yangs combine, they shine brightly. Emperor: What do you mean by Shao Yin (the Kidney)? Lord Huan replied: When two Yins intermingle completely. Emperor: There is much Qi, diseases are severe or mild, treatments are gentle or urgent, and prescriptions are large or small. I wish to hear about the essentials of these. Lord Huan replied: There is high and low Qi, diseases are near or far away, diagnoses are inner or outer, treatments are light or heavy, following this approach leads to success. The Great Treatise says: With ruler and minister as one, there is an odd system; with ruler and minister as four, there is an even system; with ruler and minister as two, there is an odd system; with ruler and minister as six, there is an even system. Therefore, it is said that nearer ones are more odd, further ones are more even, perspiration is not considered odd, lower ones are not considered even, supplementing the upper treatment and urgency, regulating by being gentle, supplementing the lower treatment and haste, hastening thickens the Qi flavor, and being gentle thins it; this is what is meant by following these essentials. When a disease is distant, yet one follows the middle path of Qi flavor, eating while passing it, there is no violation of the method. Thus, regulating Qi's middle path involves approaching odd and even in the treatment, making the prescription smaller for the odd approach and larger for the even approach. Larger means fewer prescriptions, and smaller means more prescriptions. More prescribes nine, while less prescribes two. If the odd does not disappear, then the even will take its place, which is called a heavy method. If the even does not disappear, then it supports by counteracting, treating according to the patient's cold, heat, hot and cool reversals following the disease. Emperor: Good. Diseases arise from their root, and I understand this. How should one treat when there is a label (diagnosis)? Lord Huan replied: If the disease reverses its root, it becomes a labeled disease; treating by reversing the root, use the labeled method.</p>

<p>帝曰：善。六氣之勝，何以候之。歧伯曰：乘其至也，清氣大來，燥之勝也，風木受邪，肝病生焉。熱氣大來，火之勝也，金燥受邪，肺病生焉。寒氣大來，水之勝也，火熱受邪，心病生焉。濕氣大來，土之勝也，寒水受邪，腎病生焉。風氣大來，木之勝也，土濕受邪，脾病生焉。所謂感邪而生病也。乘年之虛，則邪甚也。失時之和，亦邪甚也。遇月之空，亦邪甚也。重感於邪，則病危矣。有勝之氣，其必來復也。帝曰：其脈至何如。歧伯曰：厥陰之至其脈弦，少陰之至其脈鉤，太陰之至其脈沈，少陽之至大而浮，陽明之至短而濇，太陽之至大而長。至而和則平，至而甚則病，至而反者病，至而不至者病，未至而至者病，陰陽易者危。
Emperor: Good. What is the way to predict the victorious ascendance of the six qi? Duke of Shuo replied: One should take advantage of its peak, when the clear qi arrives in abundance, the fire prevails, the wood and metal suffer from pathogenic factors, causing liver disease. When the heat qi arrives in abundance, the fire prevails, the metal and earth suffer from pathogenic factors, causing lung disease. When the cold qi arrives in abundance, the water prevails, the fire and heat suffer from pathogenic factors, causing heart disease. When the dampness qi arrives in abundance, the soil prevails, the cold and water suffer from pathogenic factors, causing kidney disease. When the wind qi arrives in abundance, the wood prevails, the soil and dampness suffer from pathogenic factors, causing stomach disease. In general, contracting a pathogenic factor causes illness. Riding the fluctuations of age, the pathogenic factor becomes severe. Missing the harmony of time, this also indicates a severe pathogenic factor. Encountering the void of the month, this also indicates a severe pathogenic factor. Suffering from a stronger pathogenic factor, then the illness will be critical. If there is a victorious qi, it must return. Emperor: How does the pulse reach its peak? Duke of Shuo replied: When the kidney qi reaches its peak, the pulse will be tight; when the yin qi of the lower body reaches its peak, the pulse will be hook-like; when the yin qi of the upper body reaches its peak, the pulse will be sunken; when the yang qi of the lower body reaches a large and floating state, the pulse will be short and weak; when the radiant qi reaches a large and long state, this indicates a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>帝曰：六氣標本，所從不同，柰何。歧伯曰：氣有從本者，有從標本者，有不從標本者也。帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯曰：少陽太陰從本，少陰太陽從本從標，陽明厥陰不從標本從乎中也。故從本者，化生於本，從標本者，有標本之化，從中者，以中氣為化也。帝曰：脈從而病反者，其診何如。歧伯曰：脈至而從，按之不鼓，諸陽皆然。帝曰：諸陰之反，其脈何如。歧伯曰：脈至而從，按之鼓甚而盛也。是故百病之起，有生於本者，有生於摽者，有生於中氣者，有取本而得者，有取摽而得者，有取中氣而得者，有取摽本而得者，有逆取而得者，有從取而得者。逆，正順也。若順，逆也。故曰：知摽與本，用之不殆，明知逆順，正行無問。此之謂也。不知是者，不足以言診，足以亂經。故《大要》曰：粗工嘻嘻，以為可知，言熱未已，寒病復始，同氣異形，迷診亂經，此之謂也。夫標本之道，要而博，小而大，可以言一而知百病之害，言摽與本，易而勿損，察本與摽，氣可令調，明知勝復，為萬民式，天之道畢矣。
The Emperor said: What about the six Qi patterns? If they originate from different sources, how can this be? Kuang-pen said: Qi has origins that come from within and those that come from without. The Emperor said: Please elaborate on this point. Kuang-pen said: Yang Ming and Shao Yin have their origins within. Shao Yang and Tai Yin have both an origin and a mark. It is from the middle Qi where they originate. The Emperor asked: If the pulse indicates disease in reverse, how should one diagnose? Kuang-pen said: When the pulse arrives and is felt, but not pulsating, all Yang are like this. The Emperor asked: How about the reversal of Yin? Kuang-pen said: When the pulse arrives and is pulsating greatly and abundant, it is like this. Therefore, in the onset of one hundred diseases, some originate from within, some from an exterior source, some from the middle Qi, some by taking what is within, some by taking what is exterior, and some by taking the middle Qi. Some are reversed, some are correct, and some are mixed. If things are correct, then they will be reversed; if they are reversed, then they will be corrected. This is why it says: Knowing the exterior and using it does not lead to peril, knowing right from wrong ensures proper conduct without doubt. This is what is meant by this. Not knowing cause and effect is insufficient for speaking of diagnosis, but sufficient for confusing medical texts. Therefore, the Great Collection says: A crude worker speaks arrogantly, saying he can distinguish between heat and cold, with fever and cold diseases starting anew, same Qi different forms, confusing diagnosis and confusing medical texts, this is what is meant. The path of mark and origin is profound and far-reaching, small yet great, able to speak of one and know a hundred diseases' harm, speaking of the exterior and the origin is easy but must not be careless, discerning the origin and exterior, Qi can be regulated, knowing victory and defeat is exemplary for all people, and this completes the way of Heaven.</p>

<p>帝曰：勝復之變，早晏何如。歧伯曰：夫所勝者，勝至已病，病已慍慍，而復已萌也。夫所復者，勝盡而起，得位而甚，勝有微甚，復有少多，勝和而和，勝虛而虛，天之常也。帝曰：勝復之作，動不當位，或後時而至，其故何也。歧伯曰：夫氣之生，與其化衰盛異也。寒暑溫涼盛衰之用，其在四維。故陽之動，始於溫，盛於暑，陰之動，始於清，盛於寒。春夏秋冬，各差其分。故《大要》曰：彼春之暖，為夏之暑，彼秋之忿，為冬之怒，謹按四維，斥候皆歸，其終可見，其始可知。此之謂也。帝曰：差有數乎。歧伯曰：又凡三十度也。帝曰：其脈應皆何如。歧伯曰：差同正法，待時而去也。脈要曰：春不沈，夏不弦，冬不濇，秋不數，是謂四塞。沈甚曰病，弦甚曰病，濇甚曰病，數甚曰病，參見曰病，復見曰病，未去而去曰病，去而不去曰病，反者死。故曰：氣之相守司也，如權衡之不得相失也。夫陰陽之氣，清靜則生化治，動則苛疾起，此之謂也。帝曰：幽明何如。歧伯曰：兩陰交盡故曰幽，兩陽合明故曰明，幽明之配，寒暑之異也。帝曰：分至何如。歧伯曰：氣至之謂至，氣分之謂分，至則氣同，分則氣異，所謂天地之正紀也。帝曰：夫子言春秋氣始于前，冬夏氣始于後，余已知之矣。然六氣往復，主歲不常也，其補寫柰何。歧伯曰：上下所主，隨其攸利，正其味，則其要也，左右同法。《大要》曰：少陽之主，先甘後鹹，陽明之主，先辛後酸，太陽之主，先鹹後苦，厥陰之主，先酸後辛，少陰之主，先甘後鹹，太陰之主，先苦後甘，佐以所利，資以所生，是謂得氣。
Emperor said: What of the victory and defeat in change? What is it like to be young and old? The Duke of Zhou replied: The one who wins, when the victory has been achieved, has already fallen ill, and the illness already has some recovery. The one who recovers, having won completely and arising, has a great position, winning has a little, recovering has more or less, winning is harmonious and in harmony, losing is also in harmony. What is the cause of victory and defeat changing? The Duke of Zhou replied: The energy's generation and decline differ greatly. The influences of hot and cold, moist and dry, abundant and declining have their uses in the four seasons. Therefore, the Yang movement begins with warmth, is most abundant in heat, while the Yin movement begins with clarity and is most abundant in cold. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each have their own differences. Therefore, the Great Learning says: The warmth of spring becomes the heat of summer, the clarity of autumn becomes the cold of winter, carefully observe the four seasons, all signs are gathered here, and this is what is meant. The Emperor asked: Are there differences? The Duke of Zhou replied: Again, it is thirty degrees. The Emperor asked: How should the pulse be? The Duke of Zhou replied: Differences follow the regular law and change with time. The pulse standard says: In spring, do not sink; in summer, do not tighten; in winter, do not scatter; in autumn, do not number. This is called the four stoppages. Sinking too much indicates illness, tightening too much indicates illness, scattering too much indicates illness, numbering too much indicates illness, seeing and disappearing indicate illness, appearing and not disappearing indicate illness, reversed indicates death. Therefore it is said: The energy of Yin and Yang mutually guards the regulation, like the balance and scale that do not miss each other. The Duke of Zhou said: Hiding and brightness are the result of Yin and Yang mingling completely. How should they be divided? The Emperor asked: At what point? The Duke of Zhou replied: Regarding the energy, when it is complete, it is called 'at', and regarding the division, it is called 'division'. Complete, then the energy is the same; divide, then the energy is different. This is the heavenly law. The Emperor said: Master, how should spring and autumn energy begin in front, and summer and winter energy begin behind? I already know this. However, the six energies going back and forth control the year without being constant, how should they be supplemented and written? The Duke of Zhou replied: Regarding what is above and below, follow their utility, regulate their flavor, then that is its principle. The 'Great Learning' says: Regarding the energy of Shao Yang, it is salty before and bitter afterward; regarding the energy of Yang Ming, it is sour before and acidic afterward; regarding the energy of Tai Yang, it is bitter before and harsh afterward; regarding the energy of Shao Yin, it is salty before and bitter afterward; regarding the energy of Tai Yin, it is harsh before and sweet afterward. Support it with what is useful to it, provide it with what is generated by it, and this is called obtaining energy.</p>

<p>帝曰：善。夫百病之生也，皆生於風寒暑濕燥火，以之化之變也。經言盛者寫之，虛者補之，余錫以方士，而方士用之尚未能十全，余欲令要道必行，桴鼓相應，猶拔刺雪汙，工巧神聖，可得聞乎。歧伯曰：審察病機無失氣宜，此之謂也。帝曰：願聞病機何如。歧伯曰：諸風掉胘1，皆屬於肝。諸寒收引，皆屬於腎。諸氣膹鬱，皆屬於肺。諸濕腫滿，皆屬於脾。諸熱瞀瘛，皆屬於火。諸病痒瘡，皆屬於心。諸厥固泄，皆屬於下。諸痿喘嘔，皆屬於上。諸禁鼓慄，如喪神守，皆屬於火。諸痙項強，皆屬於濕。諸逆衝上，皆屬於火。諸脹腹大，皆屬於熱。諸躁狂越，皆屬於火。諸暴強直，皆屬於風。諸病有聲鼓之如鼓，皆屬於熱。諸病胕腫疼酸驚駭，皆屬於火。諸轉反戾水液渾濁，皆屬於熱。諸病水液澄澈清冷，皆屬於寒。諸嘔吐酸暴注下迫，皆屬於熱。故《大要》曰：謹守病機，各司其屬，有者求之，無者求之，盛者責之，虛者責之，必先五勝，踈其血氣，令其調達，而致和平，此之謂也。1. 胘 : 或作「眩」。《乾隆御覽四庫全書薈要》本作「眩」。
Emperor said: Good. All illnesses are generated from the six external factors of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, which cause transformation and change. The Classics say that those who excel in this should write about it, while those who lack understanding should supplement it. I will make the essential principles of medicine definite, clear and precise, so that there is no way they cannot be put into practice. The Marquis of Wu said: Examining the pathology of illness, this is what is meant. Emperor asked: I wish to hear what the pathology of illness is like. The Marquis of Wu replied: All wind causing coughs and convulsions belong to the liver. All cold causing contraction and retracting belong to the kidneys. All qi stagnation causing oppression belongs to the lungs. All dampness causing swelling and fullness belongs to the spleen. All heat causing itching and eruptions belongs to fire. All feebleness of limbs, shortness of breath, and vomiting belong to the heart. All incontinence of urine and defecation belongs to the bladder. All weakness and wheezing, as well as hiccoughs, belong to the upper part. All trembling, rigidity, and convulsions belong to fire. All swelling and pain in the neck belong to dampness. All reversed and surging upwards belong to fire. All distension and bloating of the abdomen belong to heat. All restlessness and madness beyond control belong to fire. All sudden strength and rigidity belong to wind. All illnesses with drumming sounds, like drums, belong to heat. All sickness with lumps, swelling, pain, shock, and alarm belong to fire. All diseases that reverse, thicken, and pollute fluids belong to heat. All sicknesses with clear and cold fluids belong to cold. All nausea, vomiting, and harsh registration downward belong to heat. Therefore, the Classic of Essential Prescriptions says: Be meticulous in guarding the pathology of illness, and let each organ handle its own respective function. Seek what is present and seek what is absent, make those who excel accountable, and rebuke those who are deficient. First achieve the five victories, regulate the blood and qi, and establish harmony and peace, this is what is meant.</p>

<p>帝曰：善。五味陰陽之用何如。歧伯曰：辛甘發散為陽，酸苦涌泄為陰，鹹味涌泄為陰，淡味滲泄為陽。六者，或收，或散，或緩，或急，或燥，或潤，或耎，或堅，以所利而行之，調其氣，使其平也。帝曰：非調氣而得者，治之柰何。有毒無毒，何先何後，願聞其道。歧伯曰：有毒無毒，所治為主，適大小為制也。帝曰：請言其制。歧伯曰：君一臣二，制之小也，君一臣三佐五，制之中也，君一臣三佐九，制之大也。寒者熱之，熱者寒之，微者逆之，甚者從之，堅者削之，客者除之，勞者溫之，結者散之，留者攻之，燥者濡之，急者緩之，散者收之，損者溫之，逸者行之，驚者平之，上之下之，摩之浴之，薄之劫之，開之發之，適事為故。
Emperor said: Good. How is the use of five flavors of yin and yang? Kuai Bo said: Sweet and spicy are yang, sour and bitter are yin, salty flavor is yin, bland is yang. Six of them can be taken in or released outwards, can be slow or quick, dry or moist, soft or hard, light or dense, depending on their benefits to act accordingly, adjust the qi and make it balanced. Emperor said: If not adjusting the qi, how can one treat? Poisonous and non-poisonous, which comes first, which comes later, I wish to hear the method. Kuai Bo said: The treated object is the primary focus, and adjusting the small or large depending on the condition is the method. Emperor said: Please explain the method. Kuai Bo said: A ruler and minister as a small method, a ruler, minister, and three assistants as a medium method, and a ruler, minister, three assistants, and nine attendants as a great method. Cold treatment with heat, hot treatment with cold, mild treatment with inversion, severe treatment with following, hard treatment with deletion, outsiders with elimination, labor with warmth, knot with dispersion, stay with attack, dryness with moisture, quickness with slowness, scattering with collection, damage with warmth, leisure with action, surprise with stability, up and down with massage and bath, thin with robbery, opening with release, appropriate events as a basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：何謂逆從。歧伯曰：逆者正治，從者反治，從少從多，觀其事也。帝曰：反治何謂。歧伯曰：熱因寒用，寒因熱用，塞因塞用，通因通用，必伏其所主，而先其所因，其始則同，其終則異，可使破積，可使潰堅，可使氣和，可使必已。
The emperor asked, What is meant by disobedience? Zhou Bo replied, Disobedience refers to acting contrary to proper conduct and obedience refers to acting in accordance with proper conduct. Obedience may be greater or lesser; one should observe the specific actions. The emperor then asked, What do you mean by 'acting contrary'? Zhou Bo responded, When it is hot, use cold; when it is cold, use heat; when there is a blockage, use a blockage; and when there is openness, use openness. One must seize the subject and precede its cause. If one's actions are consistent at the beginning, they will become divergent in the end. This allows for the breakdown of accumulated strength, the weakening of firm resolve, the harmonizing of energies, and ultimately brings about completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。氣調而得者何如。歧伯曰：逆之，從之，逆而從之，從而逆之，踈氣令調則其道也。帝曰：善。病之中外何如。歧伯曰：從內之外者調其內，從外之內者治其外，從內之外而盛於外者，先調其內而後治其外，從外之內而盛於內者，先治其外而後調其內，中外不相及，則治主病。
The sovereign said: Good. How about regulating the qi and achieving success? Zhou Bo said: When it is out of balance, lead it; when it follows, follow and lead it; when it follows and leads, regulate its qi to bring it into balance. The sovereign said: Good. How about treating diseases inside and outside? Zhou Bo said: For the external disease that originates internally, first regulate the internal aspect before addressing the external; for the internal disease that originates externally, first treat the external before addressing the internal. When there is no distinction between inner and outer, focus on the treatment to address the disease.</p>

<li>
<p>帝曰：善。火熱復惡寒，發熱有如瘧狀，或一日發，或閒數日發，其故何也。歧伯曰：勝復之氣，會遇之時，有多少也。陰氣多而陽氣少，則其發日遠，陽氣多而陰氣少，則其發日近。此勝復相薄盛衰之節，瘧亦同法。帝曰：論言治寒以熱，治熱以寒，而方士不能廢繩墨而更其道也。有病熱者，寒之而熱，有病寒者，熱之而寒，二者皆在新病復起，柰何治。歧伯曰：諸寒之而熱者取之陰，熱之而寒者取之陽，所謂求其屬也。帝曰：善。服寒而反熱，服熱而反寒，其故何也。歧伯曰：治其王氣，是以反也。帝曰：不治王而然者，何也。歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也。不治五味屬也。夫五味入胃，各歸所喜，攻酸先入肝，苦先入心，甘先入脾，辛先入肺，鹹先入腎，久而增氣，物化之常也。氣增而久，夭之由也。
Emperor: Good. Fire is hot and evil cold, developing a fever is like an attack of malaria, occurring either in one day or after several days of idleness, why is this? Minister Kan: The victorious qi meets the time, with how much strength there is. If yin qi is abundant and yang qi is deficient, then the onset will be delayed. If yang qi is abundant and yin qi is deficient, then the onset will be soon. This principle of victorious qi's ebb and flow also applies to malaria. Emperor: In discussing treating cold with heat and heat with cold, physicians cannot abandon their theories and update their methods. There are patients who develop a fever due to cold when they have heat illnesses, and there are those who develop chilliness due to heat when they have cold illnesses; both occur in the early stages of new disease onset. Minister Kan: In treating patients with heat illness who develop a fever, target the yin aspect, and in treating those with cold illness who develop chills, target the yang aspect, seeking what belongs to them. Emperor: Good. Patients who develop chills while taking medicine for cold or those who develop fever while taking medicine for heat, why is this? Minister Kan: This is due to failing to treat the royal qi. Emperor: If one fails to treat the royal qi, what is the result? Minister Kan: It is a complete mystery. Failing to treat the five flavors as they belong leads to this outcome. When the five flavors enter the stomach, each goes to its preferred place, attacking sourness first enters the liver, bitter first enters the heart, sweet first enters the spleen, pungent first enters the lungs, salty first enters the kidneys, accumulating qi over time is the norm for transforming substances. When qi accumulates over time, it leads to premature death.</p>

<li>
<p>帝曰：善。方制君臣何謂也。歧伯曰：主病之謂君，佐君之謂臣，應臣之謂使，非上下三品之謂也。帝曰：三品何謂。歧伯曰：所以明善惡之殊貫也。帝曰：善。病之中外何如。歧伯曰：調氣之方，必別陰陽，定其中外，各守其鄉。內者內治，外者外治，微者調之，其次平之，盛者奪之，汗者下之，寒熱溫涼，衰之以屬，隨其攸利，謹道如法，萬舉萬全，氣血正平，長有天命。帝曰：善。
Emperor: Good. What does establishing ruler and minister mean? Duke of Zhou replied: The one who is in charge of the disease is called the ruler, the one who assists the ruler is called the minister, the one who responds to the minister is called the attendant, and these are not the three ranks above and below. Emperor: What are the three ranks? Duke of Zhou replied: This is used to distinguish between good and evil. Emperor: Good. How about treating the disease inside and outside? Duke of Zhou replied: The method of regulating qi must differentiate between yin and yang, establish its internal and external aspects, and each guard their respective domains. Inside, one should treat internally; outside, one should treat externally; refine what is subtle and harmonize it; if there is excess, remove it; if there is sweating, let it out; if it is cold or hot, mild or cool, use it to nourish and support life according to the appropriate method. Be cautious in following the way, fully accomplishing all actions, regulating qi and blood, maintaining harmony, and one will have a long life according to Heaven's decree. Emperor: Good.</p>
