<h1 id="_1">癰疽</h1>
<ol>
<li>黃帝曰：余聞腸胃受穀，上焦出氣，以溫分肉，而養骨節，通腠理。中焦出氣如露，上注谿谷，而滲孫脈，津液和調，變化而赤為血。血和則孫脈先滿溢，乃注于絡脈，皆盈，乃注于經脈，陰陽已張，因息乃行。行有經紀，周有道理，與天合同，不得休止。切而調之，從虛去實，寫則不足，疾則氣減，留則先後。從實去虛，補則有餘，血氣已調，形氣乃持。余已知血氣之平與不平，未知癰疽之所從生，成敗之時，死生之期，有遠近，何以度之，可得聞乎？
Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that the intestines and stomach receive grain, the upper cavity expels gas, warming to nourish flesh, strengthening bones and joints, and regulating sinews. The middle cavity expels gas like dew, rising to the valleys, nourishing the mother veins, harmonizing body fluids, transforming into blood, and becoming red. When the blood is in harmony, the mother veins are filled first and then distributed to the nutritive veins, yin and yang are balanced, and breathing can proceed. There are records of this process, with principles that align with heaven, and cannot be neglected.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Adjusting this process requires starting with emptiness and moving towards fullness. Writing too little will not suffice; acting too hastily may deplete qi. If one lingers, there will be a sequence of deficiencies. Conversely, starting from fullness and eliminating emptiness leads to having more than enough. When blood and qi are balanced, the body's energy can be maintained.</p>
<p>I know how to balance blood and qi, but I do not know where the origin of boils and carbuncles lies, nor when success or failure, life or death will occur. Are there any teachings that can shed light on this?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>歧伯曰：經脈留行不止，與天同度，與地合紀。故天宿失度，日月薄蝕；地經失紀，水道流溢，草萓不成，五穀不殖；徑路不通，民不往來，巷聚邑居，則別離異處。血氣猶然，請言其故。夫血脈營衛，周流不休，上應星宿，下應經數。寒邪客於經絡之中，則血泣，血泣則不通，不通則衛氣歸之，不得復反，故癰腫。寒氣化為熱，熱勝則腐肉，肉腐則為膿。膿不寫則爛筋，筋爛則傷骨，骨傷則髓消，不當骨空，不得泄寫，血枯空虛，則筋骨肌肉不相榮，經脈敗漏，熏於五藏，藏傷故死矣。
Obi said: The meridians and vessels [of the body] remain unceasing, harmonizing with heaven and earth. When the heavens are out of order, the sun and moon become faint; when the earth loses its records, rivers overflow, grass does not thrive, and crops do not sprout; roads become inaccessible, and people cannot come and go, lanes becoming densely populated areas and cities. Thus, different places become alienated. Regarding blood and qi, please explain the cause. For the blood vessels nurture and defend [the body], circulating without rest, going up to correspond with stars and constellations, and going down to correspond with meridians and numbers. Cold pathogens invade the channels of the meridians, causing the blood to weep, which in turn does not flow, and so the qi energy returns to itself, unable to reverse [the situation], thus leading to swelling and tumors. Cold turns into heat, and heat, if it prevails, rots the flesh. Rotting flesh leads to ulcers. If ulcers are not treated, tendons become weakened and damage bones, damaging bone marrow, which does not flow into the empty spaces, causing blood to dry up, leading to emptiness in muscles, sinews, and flesh, and the meridians and vessels cannot complement each other, causing the five organs to be scorched, leading to injury and resulting in death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：願盡聞癰疽之形，與忌曰名。歧伯曰：癰發於嗌中，名曰猛疽。猛疽不治，化為膿，膿不寫，塞咽，半日死。其化為膿者，寫則合豕膏，冷食，三日而已。
Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the appearance of carbuncles and their names. Duke of Shao said: Carbuncles appear in the groin area and are called malignant boils. Malignant boils that cannot be treated turn into abscesses, untreated abscesses can obstruct the throat, leading to death within half a day. For those who have turned into abscesses, if treated, apply pig fat ointment, eat cold food, and they will recover in three days</p>

<p>黃帝曰：夫子言癰疽，何以別之？歧伯曰：營衛稽留於經脈之中，則血泣而不行，不行則衛氣從之而不通，壅遏而不得行，故熱。大熱不止，熱勝，則肉腐，肉腐則為膿。然不能陷，骨髓不為燋枯，五藏不為傷，故命曰癰。
Yellow Emperor said: What is the distinction between boils and carbuncles? Zhi Bó replied: The wei qi accumulates in the channels of the meridians, causing the blood to stagnate and not circulate. This leads to a blockage, preventing it from flowing freely, resulting in heat. If the heat persists and becomes dominant, the flesh begins to decay, leading to abscesses. However, one cannot become critically ill; the bone marrow does not dry up nor do the internal organs get damaged, so it is called a boil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：何謂疽？歧伯曰：熱氣淳盛，下陷肌膚，筋髓枯，內連五藏，血氣竭，當其癰下，筋骨良肉皆無餘，故命曰疽。疽者，上之皮夭以堅，上如牛領之皮。癰者，其皮上薄以澤。此其候也。
Yellow Emperor said: What is a boil? Bóu said: The vital energy is abundant and overflowing, sinking into the muscles and skin, the tendons and marrow are dry, internally connected to the five organs, blood and vital energy are exhausted, at the point where the boil emerges, all the tendons, bones, and flesh have no remaining strength, so it is called a boil. In a boil, the skin is tightened and firm like a cow's neck, while in a furuncle (癰), the skin is thin and moisturized. This is its stage.</p>
