<h1 id="_1">陰陽應象大論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝曰：陰陽者，天地之道也，萬物之綱紀，變化之父母，生殺之本始，神明之府也，治病必求於本。故積陽為天，積陰為地。陰靜陽躁，陽生陰長，陽殺陰藏。陽化氣，陰成形。寒極生熱，熱極生寒。寒氣生濁，熱氣生清。清氣在下，則生飱泄，濁氣在上，則生䐜脹。此陰陽反作，病之逆從也。
Yellow Emperor said: Yin and Yang are the way of Heaven and Earth, the pillar and foundation of all things, the parents of change. The source of birth and death lies in them, and they are the abode of gods and spirits. When treating illness, one should seek the root cause. Therefore, accumulate Yang to represent Heaven, and accumulate Yin to represent Earth. When Yin is quiet and Yang is agitated, Yang generates Yin, and Yin nourishes Yang. Yang transforms Qi, and Yin takes form. Hot extremes generate cold, and cold extremes generate heat. Cold Qi generates turbidity, and hot Qi generates clarity. Clarity Qi resides below, and it generates diarrhea; turbid Qi resides above, and it generates vomiting. This is the reverse of Yin and Yang, and the progression of disease follows from this reversal</p>
<p>2: 故清陽為天，濁陰為地；地氣上為雲，天氣下為雨；雨出地氣，雲出天氣。
The Qingyang School states that yin is Heaven and yang is Earth; the energy of the Earth ascends as clouds, and the energy of Heaven descends as rain. Rain comes from the energy of the Earth, and clouds come from the energy of Heaven.</p>
<p>3: 故清陽出上竅，濁陰出下竅；清陽發腠理，濁陰走五藏；清陽實四支，濁陰歸六府。
The clear yang rises through the upper orifice, while the turbid yin exits through the lower orifice; when the clear yang ascends to the head, the turbid yin disperses throughout the five organs; when the clear yang is complete in the four limbs, the turbid yin returns to the six departments.</p>
<p>4: 水為陰，火為陽，陽為氣，陰為味。味歸形，形歸氣，氣歸精，精歸化，精食氣，形食味，化生精，氣生形。味傷形，氣傷精，精化為氣，氣傷於味。陰味出下竅，陽氣出上竅。味厚者為陰，薄為陰之陽。氣厚者為陽，薄為陽之陰。味厚則泄，薄則通。氣薄則發泄，厚則發熱。壯火之氣衰，少火之氣壯。壯火食氣，氣食少火。壯火散氣，少火生氣。氣味，辛甘發散為陽，酸苦涌泄為陰。
Water is Yin, fire is Yang, Yang is Qi, and Yin is flavor. Flavor nourishes form, form nourishes Qi, Qi nourishes essence, essence transforms into food, and the Qi generates form. When flavor is harmed, Qi is also harmed; when essence is transformed into Qi, Qi will be harmed by flavor. Yin flavor exits through the lower orifice, while Yang Qi exits through the upper orifice. Flavor that is thick pertains to Yin, and what is thin pertains to Yin's Yang. Qi that is thick pertains to Yang, and what is thin pertains to Yang's Yin. Thick flavor leaks, while thin flavor circulates freely. When Qi is thin, it leaks; when it is thick, it generates heat. The robust fire's Qi wanes, while the scant fire's Qi becomes robust. Robust fire consumes Qi, and Qi consumes scant fire. Robust fire disperses Qi, and scant fire generates Qi. Flavor and Qi, bitter and sweet dissipate and scatter as Yang; sour and salty induce excretion as Yin</p>
<p>5: 陰勝則陽病，陽勝則陰病。陽勝則熱，陰勝則寒。重寒則熱，重熱則寒。寒傷形，熱傷氣。氣傷痛，形傷腫。故先痛而後腫者，氣傷形也；先腫而後痛者，形傷氣也。風勝則動，熱勝則腫，燥勝則乾，寒勝則浮，濕勝則濡寫。
When yin prevails, yang becomes sick; when yang prevails, yin becomes sick. When yang prevails, there is heat; when yin prevails, there is cold. Excessive cold leads to heat, excessive heat leads to cold. Cold damage causes form, and heat damage causes qi. Qi damage hurts form, and form damage swells. Therefore, if one first experiences pain and then swelling, it is qi damage causing form; if one first experiences swelling and then pain, it is form damage causing qi. If wind prevails, there will be movement; if heat prevails, there will be swelling; if dryness prevails, there will be dryness; if cold prevails, there will be floating; if dampness prevails, there will be clamminess.</p>
<p>6: 天有四時五行，以生長收藏，以生寒暑燥濕風。人有五藏，化五氣，以生喜怒悲憂恐。故喜怒傷氣，寒暑傷形。暴怒傷陰，暴喜傷陽。厥氣上行，滿脈去形。喜怒不節，寒暑過度，生乃不固。故重陰必陽，重陽必陰。故曰：冬傷於寒，春必溫病；春傷於風，夏生飱泄；夏傷於暑，秋必痎瘧；秋傷於濕，徘生欬嗽。
The four seasons and the five phases follow the cycles of growth, maturity, and decline. The five organs transform the five types of energy to give rise to feelings of happiness, anger, sadness, and fear. Hence, extreme joy or anger can damage the yin or yang energy, while excessive stimulation of the lungs or liver can disrupt bodily functions. When the vital force ascends too high or when the pulse is disrupted, the body will not be able to heal itself. Therefore, it is essential to maintain balance between yin and yang. In winter, one must protect against cold; in spring, one must prevent heat illnesses; in summer, one must guard against sunstroke; and in autumn, one must avoid dampness to avoid colds and coughs.</p>
<p>7: 帝曰：余聞上古聖人，論理人形，列別藏府，端絡經脈，會通六合，各從其經，氣穴所發各有處名，谿谷屬骨皆有所起，分部逆從，各有條理，四時陰陽，盡有經紀，外內之應，皆有表裏，其信然乎。歧伯對曰：東方生風，風生木，木生酸，酸生肝，肝生筋，筋生心，肝主目。其在天為玄，在人為道，在地為化。化生五味，道生智，玄生神，神在天為風，在地為木，在體為筋，在藏為肝，在色為蒼，在音為角，在聲為呼，在變動為握，在竅為目，在味為酸，在志為怒。怒傷肝，悲勝怒；風傷筋，燥勝風；酸傷筋，辛勝酸。南方生熱，熱生火，火生苦，苦生心，心生血，血生脾，心主舌。其在天為熱，在地為火，在體為脈，在藏為心，在色為赤，在音為徵，在聲為笑，在變動為憂，在竅為舌，在味為苦，在志為喜。喜傷心，恐勝喜；熱傷氣，寒勝熱，苦傷氣，鹹勝苦。中央生濕，濕生土，土生甘，甘生脾，脾生肉，肉生肺，脾主口。其在天為濕，在地為土，在體為肉，在藏為脾，在色為黃，在音為宮，在聲為歌，在變動為噦，在竅為口，在味為甘，在志為思。思傷脾，怒勝思；濕傷肉，風勝濕；甘傷肉，酸勝甘。西方生燥，燥生金，金生辛，辛生肺，肺生皮毛，皮毛生腎，肺主鼻。其在天為燥，在地為金，在體為皮毛，在藏為肺，在色為白，在音為商，在聲為哭，在變動為欬，在竅為鼻，在味為辛，在志為憂。憂傷肺，喜勝憂；熱傷皮毛，寒勝熱；辛傷皮毛，苦勝辛。北方生寒，寒生水，水生鹹，鹹生腎，腎生骨髓，髓生肝，腎主耳。其在天為寒，在地為水，在體為骨，在藏為腎，在色為黑，在音為羽，在聲為呻，在變動為慄，在竅為耳，在味為鹹，在志為恐。恐傷腎，思勝恐；寒傷血，燥勝寒；鹹傷血，甘勝鹹。故曰：天地者，萬物之上下也；陰陽者，血氣之男女也；左右者，陰陽之道路也；水火者，陰陽之徵兆也；陰陽者，萬物之能始也。故曰：陰在內，陽之守也；陽在外；陰之使也。
The emperor asked, I have heard that in ancient times, wise sages discussed the shape of human beings, classified them, listed their different types, and named the places where the Qi channels were located. The relationships between the four seasons, yin and yang, and exterior and interior were all explained. Is this true?</p>
<p>Duke Ai replied, In the east, there is wind; wind generates wood; wood generates sourness; sourness generates the liver; the liver generates tendons; tendons generate the heart; the liver governs the eyes. The liver's celestial manifestation is the Xuan; its human manifestation is the Dao; its terrestrial manifestation is transformation; its residence is the liver; its color is blue; its sound is a horn; its emotional aspect is anger; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, sorrow surpasses anger.</p>
<p>Wind-injured tendons are defeated by dryness; sour-injured tendons are defeated by bitter; bitter-injured hearts are defeated by salty.</p>
<p>In the south, there is heat; heat generates fire; fire generates bitterness; bitterness generates the heart; the heart generates blood; blood generates the spleen; the heart governs the tongue. Its celestial manifestation is fire; its terrestrial manifestation is earth; its residence is the vessels; its residence is the spleen; its color is red; its sound is a summons; its emotional aspect is laughter; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, fear surpasses happiness; heat-injured Qi is defeated by cold; bitter-injured Qi is defeated by salty.</p>
<p>In the center, there is dampness; dampness generates soil; soil generates sweetness; sweetness generates the spleen; the spleen generates flesh; flesh generates the lungs; the spleen governs the mouth. Its celestial manifestation is dampness; its terrestrial manifestation is earth; its residence is the flesh; its residence is the spleen; its color is yellow; its sound is a palace; its emotional aspect is thought; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, anger surpasses thought; damp-injured flesh is defeated by wind.</p>
<p>In the west, there is aridity; aridity generates metal; metal generates pungency; pungency generates the lungs; the lungs generate skin and hair; skin and hair generate the kidneys; the lungs govern the nose. Its celestial manifestation is aridity; its terrestrial manifestation is metal; its residence is the skin and hair; its residence is the kidneys; its color is white; its sound is a market; its emotional aspect is sorrow; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, joy surpasses sorrow; heat-injured skin and hair are defeated by cold; pungency-injured skin and hair are defeated by bitter.</p>
<p>In the north, there is cold; cold generates water; water generates salty; salty generates the kidneys; the kidneys generate bone marrow; bone marrow generates the liver; the kidneys govern the ears. Its celestial manifestation is cold; its terrestrial manifestation is water; its residence is the bones; its residence is the kidneys; its color is black; its sound is a cry; its emotional aspect is fear; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, thought surpasses fear; cold-injured blood is defeated by dryness; salty-injured blood is defeated by sweet.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said that heaven and earth are the foundation of all things; yin and yang are the basis of blood and Qi; left and right are the path of yin and yang; water and fire are the signs of yin and yang; yin and yang are the source of all things. It is said that yin is inside, guarding the Yang; yang is outside, manifesting the function of yin.</p>
<p>8: 帝曰：法陰陽柰何。歧伯曰：陽勝則身熱，腠理閉，喘麤為之俛仰，汗不出而熱，齒乾以煩冤腹滿，死，能冬不能夏。陰勝則身寒汗出，身常清，數慄而寒，寒則厥，厥則腹滿，死，能夏不能冬。此陰陽更勝之變，病之形能也。
The Emperor asked, What is the difference between Yin and Yang? Duke Zhou replied, If Yang prevails, one will have a fever, the pulse will be tight, there will be shallow breathing and bending over, sweating without perspiration, teeth will be dry causing discomfort in the abdomen, and death. One is unable to withstand cold but can endure heat. If Yin prevails, one will have chills and sweating, the body will always feel cool, there will be frequent urination and feeling cold, leading to danger and fullness in the abdomen, resulting in death. One cannot withstand heat but can endure cold. This is the variation of the supremacy between Yin and Yang, and the form of disease.</p>
<p>9: 帝曰：調此二者，柰何。歧伯曰：能知七損八益，則二者可調，不知用此，則早衰之節也。年四十，而陰氣自半也，起居衰矣。年五十，體重，耳目不聰明矣。年六十，陰痿，氣大衰，九竅不利，下虛上實，涕泣俱出矣。故曰：知之則強，不知則老，故同出而名異耳。智者察同，愚者察異，愚者不足，智者有餘，有餘則耳目聰明，身體輕強，老者復壯，壯者益治。是以聖人為無為之事，樂恬憺之能，從欲快志於虛无之守，故壽命无窮，與天地終，此聖人之治身也。
The emperor asked: What about these two things, how are they? Duke Mu replied: If one can discern the seven gains and eight losses, then these two things can be managed; if one does not know how to use them, then it will be the time of decline. At forty years old, one's vital energy is already half, and one declines in both physical strength and appearance. At fifty years old, one's body becomes heavy, and hearing and sight are no longer clear. At sixty years old, one's genital fluid is exhausted, the lung qi is severely weakened, the nine orifices do not function properly, the lower part is empty while the upper part is full, causing tears to flow. Therefore it is said: knowing this brings strength, not knowing leads to aging. Thus, the wise person perceives the similarity, while the fool perceives the difference. The fool does not suffice, but the wise person has surplus; and with surplus, one's hearing and sight become clear, one's body becomes strong, and the old grow more robust, the robust more treatable. Therefore, a sage deals in what is without action and delights in the ability of tranquility, following desires and hastening to emptiness; thus life is endless, and matches with heaven and earth. This is how a sage treats the body.</p>
<p>10: 天不足西北，故西北方陰也，而人右耳目不如左明也。地不滿東南，故東南方陽也，而人左手足不如右強也。帝曰：何以然。歧伯曰：東方陽也，陽者其精并於上，并於上，則上明而下虛，故使耳目聰明，而手足不便也。西方陰也，陰者其精并於下，并於下，則下盛而上虛，故其耳目不聰明，而手足便也。故俱感於邪，其在上則右甚，在下則左甚，此天地陰陽所不能全也，故邪居之。故天有精，地有形，天有八紀，地有五里，故能為萬物之父母。清陽上天，濁陰歸地，是故天地之動靜，神明為之綱紀，故能以生長收藏，終而復始，惟賢人上配天以養頭，下象地以養足，中傍人事以養五藏。天氣通於肺，地氣通於嗌，風氣通於肝，雷氣通於心，谷氣通於脾，雨氣通於腎。六經為川，腸胃為海，九竅為水注之氣。以天地為之陰陽，陽之汗，以天地之雨名之；陽之氣，以天地之疾風名之。暴氣象雷，逆氣象陽。故治不法天之紀，不用地之理，則災害至矣。
The Heaven above is not fully to the West, hence the West region is shadowy. The Earth below is not fully to the South-East, hence the South-East region is bright. The Emperor asked, Why is this so? The Duke of Chou replied, The East is bright, and brightness concentrates on top; when brightness is above, it is clear while it is empty below, causing the eyes and ears to be keen and sharp but making hands and feet weak. The West is shadowy, and shadows concentrate at the bottom; when shadows are at the bottom, there is abundance downwards and emptiness upwards, causing the eyes and ears not to be keen and sharp but making hands and feet agile. Both of these cause confusion, with confusion residing above making the right pronounced and below making the left pronounced, manifesting the inability of Heaven and Earth. Hence, Heaven has essence and Earth has form, Heaven has eight seasons and Earth has five li, allowing them to be parents for all things. The clear Yang ascends to Heaven; the turbid Yin returns to Earth. Therefore, the movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth have the spirits and light as their standards, enabling generation, growth, storage, and renewal. Only sages regulate Heaven above to nourish their heads, control Earth below to nourish their feet, and manage people's affairs to nourish their five viscera. The lung meridian receives the Qi of Heaven and Earth; the mouth meridian receives the Qi of Heaven and Earth; the liver meridian receives the wind Qi; the heart meridian receives the thunder Qi; the spleen meridian receives the grain Qi; the kidney meridian receives the water Qi. The six channels are like rivers, the stomach and intestines are like seas, and the nine orifices are the points of registration for the Qi of water. By using Heaven and Earth as the basis of Yin and Yang, the Yang sweat is named by Heaven and Earth's rain; the Yang Qi is named by Heaven and Earth's brisk wind. The thunder manifests as Yang energy; the lightning manifests as Yin energy. Therefore, treating unlawfulness in Heaven's records will bring disasters upon us</p>
<p>11: 故邪風之至，疾如風雨，故善治者治皮毛，其次治肌膚，其次治筋脈，其次治六府，其次治五藏。治五藏者，半死半生也。故天之邪氣，感則害人五藏；水穀之寒熱，感則害於六府；地之濕氣，感則害皮肉筋脈。故善用鍼者，從陰引陽，從陽引陰，以右治左，以左治右，以我知彼，以表知裏，以觀過與不及之理，見微得過，用之不殆。善診者，察色按脈，先別陰陽；審清濁，而知部分；視喘息，聽音聲，而知所苦；觀權衡規矩，而知病所主。按尺寸，觀浮沈滑濇，而知病所生；以治無過，以診則不失矣。故曰：病之始起也，可刺而已；其盛，可待衰而已。故因其輕而揚之，因其重而減之，因其衰而彰之。形不足者，溫之以氣，精不足者，補之以味。其高者，因而越之；其下者，引而竭之；中滿者，寫之於內；其有邪者，漬形以為汗；其在皮者，汗而發之；其慓悍者，按而收之；其實者，散而寫之。審其陰陽，以別柔剛，陽病治陰，陰病治陽，定其血氣，各守其鄉，血實宜決之，氣虛宜𤙲引之。
When evil winds reach their peak, they move swiftly like wind and rain. Therefore, a good doctor treats the skin, then treats the muscles, then treats the channels, then treats the six palaces, then treats the five organs. Treating the five organs is as if one were halfway dead and halfway alive. Thus, heaven's evil qi affects people's five organs; earth's damp qi harms skin, flesh, tendons, and channels; cold and heat from grains affect six palaces. Therefore, skilled acupuncturists guide yin to treat yang and guide yang to treat yin, treating right with left and left with right, knowing the other through knowing oneself, understanding what is hidden by looking at what is apparent, and using what is slight without exhausting it. Skilled diagnosticians examine color and pulse, differentiate yin and yang first; discern clear and turbid, knowing the areas affected; observe wheezing and breathing, listen to sounds, knowing where the ailment lies. They note the balance of heaviness and lightness, know where the illness originates; they warm with qi when there is not enough form, supplement with flavor when there is not enough essence. For high ones, they guide upward; for low ones, they draw out; for those who are full, they disperse within; for those with evil, they sweat to release; for those in the skin, they sweat and expel; for those who are stubborn, they press and absorb; for those who have solidified, they scatter and disperse. Discern their yin and yang, differentiating softness and hardness; treat yang diseases with yin and treat yin diseases with yang, stabilize their blood and qi, each guarding its territory. Blood should be resolved when it is full, and qi should be guided when it is empty.</p>
