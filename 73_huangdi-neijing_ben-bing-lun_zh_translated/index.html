<h1 id="_1">本病論</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：天元九窒，余已知之，願聞氣交，何名失守？歧伯曰：謂其上下升降，遷正退位，各有經論，上下各有不前，故名失守也。是故氣交失易位，氣交迺變，變易非常，即四時失序，萬化不安，變民病也。
Yellow Emperor asked, The Heavenly Pivot consists of nine orifices, which I already know. May I hear about the balance of yin and yang? Misaligned guard? The Grand Duke replied, Regarding the rise and fall of yin and yang, as well as their shifts in position, each has its own theory, with both experiencing times when they do not advance. Hence, it is called 'misaligned guard.' Since the balance of yin and yang becomes difficult to maintain, the change in yin and yang leads to abnormalities, resulting in disruptions during the four seasons, instability among all things, and changes in human health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：升降不前，願聞其故，氣交有變，何以明知？
The Emperor said: If it cannot ascend or descend, I wish to hear its reason; if there is a change in the Qi, how can one clearly know?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯曰：昭乎問哉！明乎道矣。氣交有變，是謂天地機，但欲降而不得降者，地窒刑之。又有五運太過，而先天而至者，即交不前，但欲升而不得其升，中運抑之，但欲降而不得其降，中運抑之。於是有升之不前，降之不下者，升而至天者，有升降俱不前，作如此之分別，即氣交之變，變之有異，常各各不同，災有微甚者也。
Hu Bo said: How brilliant! How clear is the Way! The exchange of Qi has its changes, which are called the machinery of heaven and earth. If one wishes to descend but cannot descend, it is punished by the earth; if the five phases are too excessive, those who go first will be unable to advance, while wishing to ascend, they are restrained by the middle phase, and wishing to descend, they are unable to descend, also restrained by the middle phase. Thus, there is the absence of ascent and descent, ascending to heaven, with both ascending and descending not advancing, they make such a distinction, and the changes of Qi have their differences, always varying and constantly different, disasters, whether great or small, follow this pattern</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：願聞氣交遇會勝抑之由，變成民病，輕重何如？歧伯曰：勝相會，抑伏使然。是故辰戌之歲，木氣升之，主逢天柱，勝而不前。又遇庚戌，金運先天，中運勝之，忽然不前。木運升天，金迺抑之，升而不前，即清生風少，肅殺於春，露霜復降，草木乃萎。民病溫疫早發，咽嗌迺乾，四肢滿，肢節皆痛。久而化鬱，即大風摧拉，折隕鳴紊。民病卒中徧痹，手足不仁。
Emperor said: I wish to hear about the reasons for the occurrence of diseases that are caused by the meeting of qi and encounter, and how light or heavy they are. Duke of Zhou replied: The meeting of qi is victorious and suppresses the yin. Therefore, in the year of the Chenxu, the wood qi rises, controlling the pillars of heaven, triumphing but not advancing. It encounters the Jinzu, the metal phase precedes heaven, and the victorious phase is sudden but does not advance. The metal phase suppresses the wood phase, rising but not advancing, leading to a scarcity of clear life-giving energy, killing many in spring, and causing dew and frost to fall again. The plants wither away. People's diseases become warm fevers that occur early, throat and lips are dry, limbs are full, and joints all hurt. Over time, it turns into depression, leading to a great wind destroying crops, breaking branches and ringing sounds. People's diseases in the final stage are paralyzed, with no sensitivity in hands and feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故己亥之歲，君火升天，主窒天蓬，勝之不前。又厥陰木遷正，則少陰未得升天，水運以至其中者。君火欲升，而中水運抑之，升之不前，即清寒復作，冷生旦暮。民病伏陽，而內生煩熱，心神驚悸，寒熱閒作。日久成鬱，即暴熱迺至，赤風腫翳，化疫，溫癘暖作，赤氣瘴而化火疫，皆煩而躁渴，渴甚治之以泄之可止。
Therefore, in the year of Jia-hai, the fire of the emperor ascends to heaven, and the lord of the gate of heavenly peace reigns supreme, not being able to advance. Again, if the excessive yin changes its position to wood, then the lesser yin has not yet reached the point of ascending to heaven, and water energy penetrates it. The emperor's fire tries to rise, but is restrained by the water energy within, so that it cannot advance; this leads to a repetition of the clear cold, with daytime and nighttime chilliness. The people catch feverish colds, while internal heat produces discomfort, troubled minds and spirits. As time goes by, sudden high fevers arise, marked by redness of face, swelling, and plague, followed by a warm illness with hot feelings and sweating. The vital energy turns into fire sickness, manifesting as feverish disorders, restlessness, thirst, and inability to be cured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故子午之歲，太陰升天，主窒天沖，勝之不前。又或遇壬子，木運先天而至者，中木遇抑之也。升天不前，即風埃四起，時舉埃昏，雨溼不化。民病風厥涎潮，徧痹不隨，脹滿。久而伏鬱，即黃埃化疫也，民病夭亡，臉肢府黃疸滿閉，溼令弗布，雨化迺微。
Therefore, in the Year of the Siwu, the Yang Fire ascends and governs the Opening of Heaven, triumphing without stopping. Also, one may encounter Xu Hai (Rabbit), when Wood Grain is ahead, indicating that Wood encounters constraint. Ascending without stopping means that Wind and Dust will suddenly arise, sometimes raising Dust and darkness, and rain not drying up. The people fall ill with Wind Stroke and Sweating Sickness, which do not progress in parallel, causing distention and fullness. If it continues, it results in the Yellow Dust plague, and the people's illness leads to death, with their faces and limbs yellow and swollen, closed like a bowl, while the rain does not evaporate, and dries up little by little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故丑未之年，少陽升天，主窒天蓬，勝之不前。又或遇太陰未遷正者，即少陰未升天也，水運以至者。升天不前，即寒雰反布，凜冽如冬，水復涸，冰再結，暄暖乍作，冷復布之，寒暄不時。民病伏陽在內，煩熱生中，心神驚駭，寒熱閒爭。以久成鬱，即暴熱迺生，赤風氣瞳翳，化成鬱癘，迺作伏熱內煩，痹而生厥，甚則血溢。
Hence, in the year of the hour of Ch'ou before the birth of the Lesser Yin, the Sun ascends to Heaven, but will not advance. This is followed by a drought in the region governed by the Greater Yin, who has not moved into her proper position. When this occurs, it means that the water phase is approaching. If the sun does not advance, then cold mists pervade, like winter frost; the water again recedes, ice reforms, and for a time warmth appears, only to be followed by more cold. People become sick with internal heat of Yang, suffering fever and disturbance of spirit, which alternates between chill and warmth. If this continues for some time, it leads to a violent fever, redness and heat of the eyes, and changes into internal fever, causing pain and producing convulsions; in severe cases, there is bleeding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故寅申之年，陽明升天，主窒天英，勝之不前。又或遇戊戊寅，火運先天而至。金欲升天，火運抑之，升之不前，即時雨不降，西風數舉，鹹鹵燥生。民病上熱喘嗽血溢。久而化鬱，即白埃翳霧，清生殺氣，民病脅滿悲傷，寒鼽嚏嗌乾，手拆皮膚燥。
Therefore, during the year of the Tiger and Rabbit, Yin Ming ascended to heaven, presiding over the triumph of the Yellow Emperor, who was victorious without having to advance. There were also instances where one encountered two Wood Tigers. The Fire star arrived in the heavens early. Gold desired to ascend to heaven but was restrained by the Fire star, and therefore did not ascend, resulting in no rain falling at the appropriate time, west winds repeatedly rising, and the salted fish industry thriving. People fell ill with high fevers, panting, and bleeding. This then turned into a gloomy state, where white dust, haze, and purifying qi prevailed, causing people's illnesses to become increasingly alarming and filled with sorrow, while colds became severe and throats parched, leading to skin peeling and drying out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故卯酉之年，太陽升天，土窒天內，勝之不前。又遇陽明未遷正者，即太陽未升天也，土運以至。水欲升天，土運抑之，升之不前，即溼而熱蒸，寒生雨閒。民病注不，食不及化。久而成鬱，冷來客熱，冰雹卒至。民病厥逆而噦，熱生於內，氣痹於外，足脛痠疼，反生心悸懊熱，暴煩而復厥。
Therefore, in the year of Jīnyín (Punishment and Completion), when the sun ascends to heaven, the earth is sealed within, and it is victorious but cannot advance further. It encounters Yángmíng (Brilliance without Falsehood) before moving to its proper place, which is when the sun has not yet risen to heaven and earth, with the earth running its course. Water tries to rise to heaven, but the earth suppresses it so it cannot advance further; it then becomes damp and hot, cold and rainy. People suffer from fevers that don't subside, and their food is not properly transformed. Over time, this leads to melancholy, with cold bringing out heat and hailstorms becoming severe. People suffer from severe fevers, and the heat generates internal discomfort while blocking external movement; they have pain in their ankles, and their hearts are restless and troubled by guilt, causing a sudden fever that is difficult to cure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：升之不前，余已盡知其旨。願聞降不下，可得明乎？歧伯曰：悉乎哉問！是之謂天地微旨，可以盡陳斯道，所謂升已降也。至天三年，次歲必降，降而入地，始為左閒也。如此升降往來，命之六紀者矣。是故丑未之歲，厥陰降地，主窒地皛，勝而不前。又或遇少陰未退位，即厥陰未降下，金運以至中。金運承之，降之不下，抑之變鬱，木欲降下，金承之，降而不下，蒼埃遠見，白氣承之，風舉埃昏，清躁行殺，霜露復下，肅殺布令。久而不降，抑之化鬱，即作風躁相伏，暄而反清，草木萌動，殺霜乃，蟄未見，懼清傷藏。
Yellow Emperor said: The ascent is not immediate, and I have already fully understood its intention. Is it possible to hear about the descent that does not come down? Duke of Zhou said: Indeed, you are asking about it! This refers to the subtle intention of heaven and earth, which can be fully explained in this way, and it is called ascending and descending. After three years in heaven, it must descend each year. When it enters the land, it becomes the first yin, and when it does not advance, it is called the left idle period. The cycle of rising and falling goes back and forth, making six records. Therefore, in the years of chen and si, the great yin descends to the earth, controlling the apertures of the earth and winning without advancing. It may also encounter a small yang that has not yet retreated, and if the great yin does not descend, the golden rune will be right in the middle. The golden rune bears it, and the descent is not immediate, suppressing it and causing huidun to turn into chaos. Wood may try to descend, gold bears it and prevents it from descending, and the blue dust is far away, white qi bearing it, the wind raises the dust and makes it hazy, clear and lively, frost and dew fall again, and hide the slaying mandate. If it does not descend for a long time, it suppresses it into chaos, and then becomes wind and chaos, piercing and hiding, suddenly becoming clear, grass and trees stir, killing the frost, and seeing no insects, fearing the clear danger and hiding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故寅申之歲，少陰降地，主窒地玄，勝之不入。又或遇丙申丙寅，水運太過，先天而至。君火欲降，水運承之，降而不下，即彤雲纔見，黑氣反生，暄暖如舒，寒常布雪，凜冽復作，天雲慘悽。久而不降，伏之化鬱，寒勝復熱，赤風化疫，民病面赤心煩，頭痛目眩也，赤氣彰而溫病欲作也。
Therefore, in the year of Tian Shen, there is an insufficient Yin energy, ruling the constrained Yin Xuan, and it triumphs without reaching its goal. It may also encounter Jing Shen and Bing Shen, with water transport being too abundant, leading to premature arrival. When fire wants to descend, water supports it, but it does not fall until just after the dark clouds appear, black energy rebounds, the warmth suddenly expands like a breeze, cold always spreads snow, and the chill creates more of it. If it doesn't descend for a long time, it will secrete Ao, with cold victory leading to heat, red wind turning into disease, the people becoming ill, with their faces flushed and hearts disturbed; headaches and dizziness also occur, as the red energy is prominent and feverish diseases are about to break out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>是故卯酉之歲，太陰降地，主窒地蒼，勝之不入。又或少陽未退位者，即太陰未得降也，或木運以至。木運承之，降而不下，即黃雲見而青霞彰，鬱蒸作而大風，霧翳埃勝，折損迺作。久而不降也，伏之化鬱，天埃黃氣，地布溼蒸，民病四肢不舉，昏眩肢節痛，腹滿填臆。
Therefore, in the year of the Yin Earth Rooster (60 years later than the sexagenary cycle), the Yin prevailed and controlled the Lung, resulting in a dry and weakened state. However, this was not effective. Alternatively, if the Yang was still insufficient or not yet fully developed, it could not defeat the Yin either; this is the phase of Wood's dominance. When the Wood phase takes over, it descends without manifesting clearly, and one may see hazy blue clouds and distinct white mists. Drizzling rain and fog prevail, with branches and leaves being bent or broken. If this phase persists but does not descend, it will suppress the Yin, allowing yellow dust to spread in the sky and damp steam to cover the earth. The people will be afflicted with diseases affecting their limbs, causing dizziness, pain in joints, weakness in the waist, and abdominal distention.</p>

<p>是故辰戊之歲，少陽降地，主窒地玄，勝之不入。又或遇水運太過，先天而至也。水運承之，水降不下，即彤雲纔見，黑氣反生，暄暖欲生，冷氣卒至，甚即冰雹也。久而不降，伏之化鬱，冷氣復熱，赤風化疫，民病面赤心煩，頭痛目眩也，赤氣彰而熱病欲作也。
Therefore, in the year of Jia-shen (Chen-Wu), the Shao-yang (Minister) descended to the Earth and controlled the Yin of Xuan. This was victorious but did not enter. Alternatively, it may encounter water energy that is too excessive, leading to death before arrival. The water energy carries it, and water does not descend; as soon as the dark clouds appear, black gas rebounds, heating tends to arise, cold air becomes extreme, and it will immediately become hailstones. If it does not descend for a long time, it will hide as Tian (ice), cold air will be heated again, red wind will transform into epidemic diseases; people's hearts will be hot and restless, with headaches and dizziness, and the ardent Yang Qi is about to give rise to febrile diseases.</p>

<li>
<p>是故己亥之歲，陽明降地，主窒地彤，勝而不入。又或遇太陰未退位，即少陽未得降，即火運以至之。火運承之不下，即天清而肅，赤氣迺彰，暄熱反作。民皆旨倦，夜臥不安，咽乾引飲，懊熱內煩，大清朝暮，暄還復作，久而不降，伏之化鬱，天清薄寒，遠生白氣。民病掉眩，手足直而不仁，兩脅作痛，滿目忙忙。
Therefore, in the year of Jí Hài, the Yang Míng descended (to earth), ruling and subduing the orifices, but did not enter. Alternatively, when encountering the retreating Qī Yǐn, and the Shǎo Yáng had yet to descend, it was because of the Fire Stem reaching its height. The Fire Stem being in control, the sky became clear and calm, with fiery qi bursting forth, producing intense heat. The people were exhausted, unable to sleep at night, their throats dry and parched, tormented by internal heat, becoming delirious during the day and night, with the heat still producing discomfort after a while, it was hidden and turned into melancholy, the sky became cold and distant, and white qi began to emerge. The people fell ill, suffering from dizziness, their limbs stiff and unresponsive, pain in both arms, blurry vision, and a state of constant restlessness.</p>

<p>是故子午之年，太陽降地，主窒地阜勝之，降而不入。又或遇土運太過，先天而至。土運承之，降而不入，即天彰黑氣，暝暗悽慘，纔施黃埃而布溼，寒化令氣，蒸溼復令。久而不降，伏之化鬱，民病大厥，四肢重怠，陰痿少力，天布沈陰，蒸溼閒作。
During the year of Ziwei, the sun fell upon the earth, and the Duke of Ding conquered the state of Zhou, but did not enter it. Alternatively, if the Grand Exalt met with an excess of Earth, he arrived early. The Earth received this, and he did not enter, at which time the sky was dark and gloomy; the sun shone on the yellow dust and spread it, causing the cold to become humid again, with the moisture condensing. If it did not rain for a long time, it became hidden in the fog, and the people suffered great diseases, their limbs being heavy and sluggish, and their virility reduced and strength weakened; the sky covered in dark yin, and the sun's heat produced idle work.</p>

<p>帝曰：升降不前，晰如其宗，願聞遷正，可得明乎？歧伯曰：正司中位，是謂遷正位，司天不得其遷正者，即前司天以過交司之。即遇司天太過有餘日也，即仍舊治天數，新司天未得遷正也。厥陰不遷正，即風暄不時，花卉萎瘁，民病淋溲，目系轉，轉筋喜怒，小便赤。風欲令而寒由不去，溫暄不正，春正失時。少陰不遷正，即冷氣不退，春冷後寒，暄暖不時。民病寒熱，四肢煩痛，腰脊強直。木氣雖有餘，位不過於君火也。太陰不遷正，即雲雨失令，萬物枯焦，當生不發。民病手足肢節腫滿，大腹水腫，填臆不食，飧泄脅滿，四肢不舉。雨化欲令，熱猶治之，溫煦於氣，亢而不澤。少陽不遷正，即炎灼弗令，苗莠不榮，酷暑於秋，肅殺晚至，霜露不時。民病㾬瘧骨熱，心悸驚駭，甚時血溢。陽明不遷正，則暑化於前，肅於後，草木反榮。民病寒熱鼽嚏，皮毛折，爪甲枯燋，甚則喘嗽息高，悲傷不樂。熱化乃布，燥化未令，即清勁未行，肺金復病。太陽不遷正，即冬清反寒，易令於春，殺霜在前，寒冰於後，陽光復治，凜冽不作，雰雲待時。民病溫癘至，喉閉溢乾，煩燥而渴，喘息而有音也。寒化待燥，猶治天，氣過失序，與民作災。
The emperor asked: Why doesn't the qi of ascending and descending change, and why does it seem like this? I wish to hear about the correcting [of the qi], can it be understood clearly? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Duke of Zhou replied: The position of correcting [the qi] is referred to as adjusting the correct. In regulating heaven, if one cannot adjust the correct, then it is because one has passed over regulating heaven and exceeded the proper balance. This results in a lack of regulation in governing heaven, and not being able to adjust the correct for heaven. </p>
<p>If yin does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely winds, flowers and plants wither, people get sick from dampness, and the stars move irregularly, causing stiff joints that feel joy or anger. </p>
<p>Winds may cause cold but it doesn't go away, and the sun is not regulated so the season is out of time. </p>
<p>If yang shaoye does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely winds, clouds and rain are not timely, and all things wither. People get sick with swollen joints, edema, bloated bellies, unable to eat, and diarrhea that threatens their lives, while feverish winds do not go away. </p>
<p>If shaoyin does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely rain and clouds so everything dries up and doesn't grow. People get sick with swollen joints, edema, bloated bellies, unable to eat, and diarrhea that threatens their lives, while feverish winds do not go away. </p>
<p>If jueyin does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely rain and clouds so everything dries up and doesn't grow. People get sick with chills and fever, their hearts are disturbed and afraid, and it is a critical time for bleeding. </p>
<p>If yangming does not adjust the correct, heat will come too early, while cold comes later. Grasses and trees become damaged, people get sick with chills and fevers, hair and skin dry up, nails become brittle, and in severe cases, there is wheezing and high-pitched breathing while unable to find joy. </p>
<p>Heat becomes a disaster, while dryness does not go away, so the lungs' qi does not circulate, and jīn (metal) becomes sick again. </p>
<p>If taiyang does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely cold in winter, easy to cause frostbite, and cold ice lingers longer after winter, causing yáng (sunlight) to fail to regulate. People get sick with warmth rashes, chills, throats that close up and become dry, they feel irritated and thirsty while wheezing and having high-pitched breathing. </p>
<p>Cold becomes a disaster, as if regulating heaven, but the qi goes over the proper balance, causing harm to people.</p>

<p>帝曰：遷正早晚，以命其旨，願聞退位，可得明哉？歧伯曰：所謂不退者，即天數未終，即天數有餘，名曰復布政，故名曰再治天也，即天令如故而不退位也。厥陰不退位，即大風早舉，時雨不降，溼令不化，民病溫疫，疵廢風生，民病皆肢節痛，頭目痛，伏熱內煩，咽喉乾引飲。少陰不退位，即溫生春冬，蟄蟲早至，草木發生，民病膈熱咽乾，血溢驚駭，小便赤澀，丹瘤疹瘡瘍留毒。太陰不退位，而取寒暑不時，埃昏布作，溫令不去，民病四支少力，食飲不下，泄注淋滿，足脛寒，陰痿閉塞，失溺小便數。少陽不退位，即熱生於春，暑迺後化，冬溫不凍，流水不冰，蟄蟲出見，民病少氣，寒熱更作，便血上熱，小腹堅滿，小便赤沃，甚則血溢。陽明不退位，即春生清冷，草木晚榮，寒熱閒作，民病嘔吐暴注，食飲不下，大便乾燥，四肢不舉，目瞑掉眩。
The emperor said: When should I ascend the throne? It is a matter of life and death. May I know if it is appropriate to abdicate now, and can it be clearly understood? The Duke of Shou replied: The one who does not abdicate means that the days are not yet complete, and there is still time remaining. This is called 'restoring the canopy' and 'reordering Heaven.' It means to continue the decree as before without abdicating. If the left yang does not abdicate, it means early north winds will arise, rain will not fall, the flooding will not subside, and the people will suffer from summer and autumn fevers. The diseases will all be joint pain, headaches, feverish internal discomfort, sore throats, and dry throats that impede drinking. If the right yin does not abdicate, it means that warm weather will arise in spring and autumn, insects will arrive early, plants will sprout, and people will suffer from abdominal heat and sore throat, bloody secretions will be agitated, urine will be red and turbid, and toxic sores and lesions will remain. If the yin does not abdicate, it means that cold and heat will change unpredictably, dizziness and confusion will arise, the cold will not disperse, and people will suffer from weak limbs, their food and drink will not go down, they will have incontinence and be drenched, their soles and heels will be cold, and their essence will be wasted, causing difficulty in urinating. If the lesser yang does not abdicate, it means that heat will arise in spring, summer will follow quickly, winter warmth will not freeze, and water will not freeze, insects will appear, people will suffer from weakness of the spirit, alternating cold and heat, feverish blood will rise, the lower abdomen will be hard and distended, and urine will be red and wet. If the primordial yang does not abdicate, it means that in spring there will be clear and cold weather, plants will wither late, cold and heat will alternate, and people will suffer from vomiting and severe diarrhea, their food and drink will not go down, their limbs will not move, and their eyes will blink and wander.</p>

<p>帝曰：天歲早晚，余以知之，願聞地數，可得閒乎？歧伯曰：地下遷正升及退位不前之法，即地土產化，萬物失時之化也。
The emperor said: Heaven's rise and set, I know of them. Will you please tell me the number of changes in the earth? Is there leisure in it? Tui Bo said: The law of the earth is its shifting position upwards and downwards, and the changing of positions that do not advance. This corresponds to the transformation of the earth's products into the myriad things, and the failure of their proper times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：余聞天地二甲子，十干十二支。上下經緯天地，數有迭移，失守其位，可得昭乎？歧伯曰：失之迭位者，謂雖得歲正，未得正位之司，即四時不節，即生大疫。注《玄珠密語》云：陽年三十年，除六年天刑，計有太過二十四年，除此六年，皆作太過之用，令不然之旨。今言迭支迭位，皆可作其不及也。
The emperor said: I have heard that there are two 'Algazali' in the heaven and earth, namely the ten stems and twelve branches. They govern the cycle of the universe. When the celestial bodies move up and down along their ecliptic, sometimes they lose their positions, can this be seen clearly? Duke Zhou replied: Those who fail to maintain their positions are those who may have mastered the solar terms, but have not grasped the timing of the celestial bodies. This results in the four seasons being out of order and brings about a great plague. The note from the Xuanzangmiyu states: The years governed by yang last thirty years, with six exception years, making it a total of twenty-four overly long years. Subtracting these six exception years, they all serve to demonstrate the intention of avoiding the undesirable result. Now if we talk about iterations of the ten stems and twelve branches, this can also be applied in the same way.</p>

<p>假令甲子陽年，土運太窒，如癸亥天數有餘者，年雖交得甲子，厥陰猶尚治天，地已遷正，陽明在泉，去歲少陽以作右閒，即厥陰之地陽明，故不相和奉者也。癸巳相會，土運太過，虛反受木勝，故非太過也，何以言土運太過，況黃鐘不應太窒，木既勝而金還復，金既復而少陰如至，既木勝如火而金復微，如此則甲己失守，後三年化成土疫，晚至於卯，早至丙寅，土疫至也，大小善惡，推其天地，詳乎太一。又只如甲子年，如甲至子而合，應交司而治天，即下己未遷正，而戊寅少陽未退位者，亦甲己下有合也，即土運非太過，而木乃乘虛而勝土也，金次又行復勝之，即反邪化也。陰陽天地殊異爾，故其大小善惡，一如天地之法旨也。
Assuming that the year is a Yang year, and there is excess in the Earth branch, even if it is Geng-yin, the year still changes to Jia-zi. The Yin [Earth] will continue to govern Heaven, but the Earth has already been corrected, and the Sun is at the Spring Point, with the deficient Yang of last year used to make a right vacancy. Thus, it is not surprising that the Yin [Earth] and the Sun [Yang] do not harmonize. When Jia-yin meets Geng-xu, there is too much Earth, and Wood overcomes Vacuity. This is not because there is too much Earth; how can one say that there is too much Earth when the Yellow Bell does not respond to excess? Wood then triumphs over Earth, followed by Metal rebounding and prevailing in its turn. Next, Metal prevails slightly, as if Wood were Fire, and Metal diminishes further. Thus, Jia-yi loses its protection, and the following three years turn into an Earth sickness. It arrives at Ren-wu and first appears in Si-si, becoming a general illness of Earth. Both large and small events, good and evil, can be explained by Heaven and Earth's principles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If one takes the year as Jia-zi, when Jia and Zi meet and unite, they should exchange and govern Heaven. Now, Geng-yin has not yet been corrected, and Wu-yin is still deficient without retreating from its position; thus, there is a meeting between Jia and Yi. The year is not too much Earth, but Wood triumphs over Vacuity by virtue of this excess. Metal then prevails again, leading to reverse transformation.</p>
<p>The principles of Yin-Yang in Heaven and Earth are extremely different from what you say; thus, the large and small events, good and evil, follow the intention of Heaven and Earth's laws.</p>

<p>假令丙寅陽年太過，如乙丑天數有餘者，雖交得丙寅，太陰尚治天也，地已遷正，厥陰司地，去歲太陽以作右閒，即天太陰而地厥，故地不奉天化也。乙辛相會，水運太虛，反受土勝，故非太過，即太簇之管，太羽不應，土勝而雨化，水復即風，此者丙辛失守其會，後三年化成水疫，晚至己巳，早至戊辰，甚即速，微即徐，水疫至也，大小善惡推其天地數，乃太乙游宮。又只丙寅年，丙至寅且合，應交司而治天，即辛巳未得遷正，而庚辰太陽未退位者，亦丙辛不合德也，即水運亦小虛而小勝，或有復，後三年化癘，名曰水癘，其狀如水疫，治法如前。
Assuming that the year of the Yang is too long, and if the number of Yin years has not yet passed, even though there is a mutual hour of Yang, the Yin still governs the Heaven, and the Earth has already been rectified. The Department of Yin governs the Earth, removing the Solar Year to make the Right Excess, and immediately it becomes the Heavenly Yin and the Earthly Yin, so the Earth does not obey the Heavenly decree. When the Yin of Xin meets, the Water Resource is too weak, and suffers from the victory of the Earth, so it is not excessive, but rather belongs to the management of the Crown Prince, the Feathered Crow does not respond, and the Earth triumphs while the water changes into dew, the water again becomes wind, and this occurs in the year of Bing Xin when Bing Xin fails to attend their meeting. In the following three years, it becomes the water sickness, arriving at Jǐ Sì early and Tǐ Chên late, very fast and somewhat slow, and the water sickness comes into existence. Both small good and evil fortune can be attributed to the Heaven and Earth numbers, which are the Palace of Yin and Yin. Similarly, assuming a year of Bing Xu, Bing at Xin and merging together apply to govern Heaven and treat it as a trade, but Shēng Rì is not yet in its proper position, and in the following three years it becomes the water sickness. Its treatment law is the same as before.</p>

<p>假令庚辰陽年太過，如己卯天數有餘者，雖交庚辰年也，陽明猶尚治天，地以遷正，太陰司地，去歲少陰以作右閒，即天陽明而地太陰也，故地下奉天也。乙巳相會，金運太虛，反受火勝，故非太過也，即姑洗之管，太商不應，火勝熱化，水復寒刑，此乙庚失守，其後三年化成金疫也，速至壬午，徐至癸未，金疫至也，大小善惡，推本年天數及太一也。又只如庚辰，如庚至辰，且應交司而治天，即下乙未未得遷正者，即地甲午少陰未退位者，且乙庚不合德也，即下乙未，干失剛，亦金運小虛也，有小勝或無復，後三年化癘，名曰金癘，其狀如金疫也，治法如前。
Assuming the year of the Yang Fire (庚辰) is too strong, and if there are extra days in the Jupiter-Rabbit (己卯) year, even though it is a Yang-Fire year, the Yin and Yang are still balanced, causing the Earth to move to its proper position. The Yang is dominant above and the Yin governs below. If there is a deficiency of Yin in the previous year, this will result in an excess of Yin on the right side, with Heaven being dominated by Yin and Earth governed by Yin. This is why we say that the Earth serves Heaven. When Metal Ox (乙巳) meets, there is a deficiency of Metal, resulting in Fire being dominant. Therefore, this is not due to an excess. Like using a metal stick to manage a dog, and when Mercury fails to apply correctly, causing Fire to dominate and create heat, while Water produces cold punishment. This results in the failure of Jupiter-Roooster (庚卯) to maintain balance, leading to the development of a Metal sickness over the next three years. It gradually reaches its peak at the time of the Dragon (壬午), then slowly at the time of the Water Rat (癸未), and the Metal sickness has fully manifested. Good and evil are influenced by the heavens, based on the number of days in the year and the Taiyi principle. Similarly, if it is like Yang-Fire (庚辰) year, and Jupiter-Rooster (乙未) year also applies and governs above, but the right position of Earth is not adjusted, and there is a lack of harmony between Jupiter-Rooster and Yang-Fire. This results in the failure of Jupiter-Ox (乙巳), with a Metal deficiency that is also small and insignificant. There is a possibility of a small victory or no effect at all, leading to the development of a Metal sore over the next three years. It is called Metal Sore, its state is similar to Metal sickness, and treatment is similar to the previous method.</p>

<p>假令壬午陽年太過，如辛巳天數有餘者，雖交後壬午年也，厥陰猶尚治天，地巳遷正，陽明在泉，去歲丙申少陽以作右閒，即天厥陰而地陽明，故地不奉天者也。丁辛相合會，木運太虛，反受金勝，故非太過也，即蕤賓之管，太角不應，金行燥勝，火化熱復甚即速，微即徐，疫至大小善惡，推疫至之年天數及太一。又只如壬至午，且應交司而治之，即下丁酉未得遷正者，即地下丙申少陽未得退位者，見丁壬不合德也，即丁柔干失剛，亦木運小虛也，有小勝小復。後三年化癘，名曰木癘，其狀如風疫，法治如前。
If the reign of the Yin in the Jupiter year is too long, and if the number of days in the Solar term of Xin She has not yet ended, even though it later becomes the Ren Mao year, the Yin is still regulating heaven, while the Sun in Li Ch'ien is correctly positioned, and the Yang Ming is at the springs. The deficiency year is then followed by an excess year, resulting in a situation where heaven is dominated by Yin and earth by Yang Ming, so that earth does not obey heaven. When Metal and Fire meet, Wood is too vacuous, and suffers defeat to Earth, which therefore wins. This is not because of excess; it is simply the situation as represented by the trigram K'an (Man) and the hexagram Ta Ch'u, where the line in the top position does not change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The next year, Wood and Fire meet, but because Wood is vacuous, Fire wins. This results in a situation where heat is very intense and rapid, becoming moderated only gradually. The epidemic becomes severe or mild according to whether it occurs early or late in the year, and its onset can be predicted by counting the days of the Solar term in which the epidemic occurs. If we assume that it occurs during the Solar term Jupiter-Mao, we find that the appropriate procedure is to begin treatment at the first day of the month of Earth-Wu. This means that the Lesser Yin has not yet withdrawn its influence, and this is a situation where Metal and Wood are both lacking in strength. The result is that they lose out to Fire, which wins because of its position at the bottom of the hexagram, as represented by the trigram Ch'ien (The Creative).</p>
<p>In the next three years, the epidemic recurs, and it is called the Epidemic of Wood. Its course resembles that of the Wind Epidemic, and its treatment is the same as before.</p>

Assuming that the yang years of Wù Xīn were too long, and that the yin years of Dīng Wèi were too short, although they could enter the year of Shēn Xīn, the Yīn still governs the heavens, while the earth has been corrected, the excess yin is in the springs, and the sun of last year leaves its position to become the right yang, making it the year of Dīng Wèi, and the earth as Gēng Hài. Therefore, the earth did not follow the heavenly transformations. When Dīng and Gēng meet, the fire stalk is too weak and receives the power of fire, which is why it's not excessive. If you restrain it, it will be called the illness, its law can be found in the year when the illness occurs.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If we assume that the yang years of Wù Xīn are too long, and if Wù reaches Xīn and applies for treatment, then the heavens are governed by yin, while the earth has not been corrected, the excess yin is in the springs, and the sun of last year leaves its position to become the right yang, making it the year of Dīng Wèi, and the earth as Gēng Hài. Therefore, there is no land following the heavenly transformations. If we only assume the yang years of Wù Xīn, when Wù reaches Xīn and treats it while governing the heavens, but if below we do not correct the Gēng-Ròu year, which has not yet retreated from its position, we see the meeting of Dīng and Gēng. Below, Gēng is weak and lacks rigidity, and there is a small victory or no victory at all. In the following three years, it will be called the fire illness and treated according to the previous method. The treatment law can release cold sweat</p>

Yellow Emperor said: If a person's vital energy is insufficient and the heavenly energy is like emptiness, their spirit and soul will lose their guardianship. The celestial light will not converge, evil spirits will attack people, leading to premature death. Have you heard of this? Qi Bo replied: A person has five essences, one essence insufficiency leads to heavenly emptiness, which is the extreme susceptibility to evil spirits. When a person worries, mourns, and reflects, they hurt their heart, and may also encounter a shortage of yin governing heaven, which does not last long, causing heaven's emptiness. This is the same as the insufficiency of human vital energy and heavenly energy. Moreover, upon being startled, they lose their spirit, sweat flows from the heart, resulting in three forms of emptiness, and their soul and divine light lose their guardianship. The soul serves as the emperor's official, coming forth from the divine on high, the divine light loses its guardianship, and does not converge when it encounters a year without fire. Black corpses may appear and cause people to die violently. People's vital energy is damaged by overeating and tiredness, or they may encounter a shortage of yin governing heaven, which does not last long, causing the sun to become more prominent. Yellow corpse spirits may appear and cause violent deaths. Sitting for a long time in damp places can harm the kidneys, as the kidneys are the official in charge of strength and agility, coming forth from within. This results in three forms of emptiness, as the kidney spirit loses its guardianship, with the divine light not converging when it encounters a year without water. Green corpses may appear and cause violent deaths. People sometimes feel anger or sorrow, causing qi to flow counter to its proper direction, harming the liver. If there is an insufficiency of yin governing heaven, which does not last long, this is considered heavenly emptiness. This refers to both heavenly and human emptiness. Upon encountering panic and fear, sweat flows from the liver, as the liver is the general's official, coming forth with strategy. The divine light loses its guardianship, and the light does not converge when it encounters a year without wood. White corpses may appear and cause violent deaths. In conclusion, if a person loses the guardianship of the five spirits, this is heavenly emptiness and human emptiness. The divine light wanders without guardianship, leading to the attack by five corpse spirits, causing violent deaths. This is also known as the corpse evil. A person who loses the balance of the five spirits will not have a converging divine light, nor are only corpse evils the only danger. It means that those who lose the guardianship of position and die are doomed to destruction by the divine light, while those who maintain the divine light will live.</li>
