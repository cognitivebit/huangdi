<h1 id="_1">邪氣藏府病形</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問於歧伯曰：邪氣之中人也奈何？歧伯答曰：邪氣之中人高也。
Emperor Yellow asked the Marquis Wen: What about a person in the midst of evil qi? The Marquis Wen replied: A person in the midst of evil qi is noble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：高下有度乎？歧伯曰：身半以上者，邪中之也。身半已下者，濕中之也。故曰：邪之中人也。無有常，中于陰則溜于府，中于陽則溜于經。
Yellow Emperor said: Is there a degree in high and low? Boyang replied: Those above the midpoint are perverse. Those below the midpoint are damp. Therefore, it is called perverse within people. There is no constant, if it resides in the yin, it will leak into the palace, and if it resides in the yang, it will leak into the channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：陰之與陽也，異名同類，上下相會，經絡之相貫，如環無端。邪之中人，或中于陰，或中于陽，上下左右，無有恆常，其故何也？
The Yellow Emperor said: The Yin and the Yang have different names but share the same nature. They meet above and below, and their meridians interpenetrate each other like a circle without center or end. What causes these deviant people to be either in the Yin or the Yang, with no fixed direction, left or right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯曰：諸陽之會，皆在于面。中人也，方乘虛時及新用力，若飲食汗出，腠理開而中于邪。中于面，則下陽明。中于項，則下太陽。中于頰，則下少陽。其中于膺背兩脅，亦中其經。
Ou Bo said: The gathering of Zhouyang all lies in the face. Ordinary people, when riding on emptiness and using new strength, if they drink and eat, sweat comes out, the orifices open, and they fall into evil. Gathering at the face means it goes down to the Yijing (Yangming). Gathering at the neck means it goes down to the Taiyang (Great Yang). Gathering at the mouth means it goes down to the Shaoyang (Lesser Yang). In addition, when gathering at the breast and back, they also gather their channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：其中于陰，奈何？歧伯答曰：中于陰者，常從臂胻始。夫臂與胻，其陰皮薄，其肉淖澤，故俱受于風，獨傷其陰。
Yellow Emperor said: What about the middle in Yin? Duke of Zhou replied: The one in the middle of Yin, it always starts from the arm and thigh. As for the arms and thighs, their Yin skin is thin, and their flesh is tender and moist. Therefore, both are easily affected by wind and only hurt the Yin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：此故傷其藏乎？歧伯答曰：身之中於風也，不必動藏。故邪入于陰經，則其藏氣實，邪氣入而不能客，故還之於府。故中陽則溜于經，中陰則溜于府。
Yellow Emperor asked: Is this because it injures the Sea of Qi? Duke of Shou answered: Inside the body, it is like being affected by wind; there is no need to move the storehouse. Therefore, if evil enters the Yin channel, then the storehouse of energy is full, and the evil Qi intrudes but cannot lodge, so one returns it to the palace. Thus, in the case of Yang excess, it leaks into the channel; in the case of Yin excess, it leaks into the palace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：邪之中人藏奈何？歧伯曰：愁憂恐懼則傷心。形寒寒飲則傷肺，以其兩寒相感，中外皆傷，故氣逆而上行。有所墮墜，惡血留內；若有所大怒，氣上而不下，積於脅下，則傷肝。有所擊仆，若醉入房，汗出當風，則傷脾。有所用力舉重，若入房過度，汗出浴水，則傷腎。
Yellow Emperor asked: Where can one hide from evil? Boyang replied: Fear and anxiety will harm the heart. Drinking cold drinks when the body is cold harms the lungs, as their two colds mutually generate, causing internal and external harm, leading to reversed qi movement. There is a fall or damage, resulting in stagnant blood inside; if there is excessive anger, qi accumulates in the diaphragm below, damaging the liver. Hitting servants when drunk and sweating in the wind harms the spleen. Lifting heavy objects or overdoing it in the room, sweating like bathwater, harms the kidneys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：五藏之中風，奈何？歧伯曰：陰陽俱感，邪乃得往。黃帝曰：善哉。
Yellow Emperor said: What of the five organs and wind? Master Of The North Said: Yin and Yang both respond, evil then takes its course. Yellow Emperor said: Excellent!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝問於歧伯曰：首面與身形也，屬骨連筋，同血合於氣耳。天寒則裂地凌冰，其卒寒，或手足懈惰，然而其面不衣，何也？歧伯答曰：十二經脈，三百六十五絡，其血氣皆上于面而走空竅。其精陽氣上走於目而為睛。其別氣走於耳而為聽。其宗氣上出於鼻而為臭。其濁氣出於胃，走唇舌而為味。其氣之津液，皆上燻于面，而皮又厚，其肉堅，故天氣甚寒，不能勝之也。
Emperor Yellow asked Zhong Chu, The face and body shape belong to the bones and muscles, and are nourished by blood and qi. When it is cold in heaven, the earth freezes, and its coldness may cause hands and feet to become numb; however, one's face remains uncovered. Why is this? Zhong Chu replied, There are twelve meridians and 365 channels of blood and qi flowing to the surface through pores. The Yang Qi flows up to the eyes, making them see. The separate Qi flows to the ears, making them hear. The Zong Qi comes out of the nose, making it smell. The turbid Qi comes from the stomach, moving to the lips and tongue, making them taste. All the fluids and qi of the body are nourished on the surface of the face, while the skin is thick and the flesh hard, so when heavenly cold is extremely intense, they cannot counteract it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：邪之中人，其病形何如？歧伯曰：虛邪之中身也，洒淅動形。正邪之中人也，微，先見于色，不知于身，若有若無，若亡若存，有形無形，莫知其情。黃帝曰：善哉。
Yellow Emperor asked: What are the symptoms of an evil person being possessed? Hou Ji replied: It is a vacant and evil spirit possessing the body, causing erratic movements. A righteous person possessed by an evil spirit appears weak, is first seen through their complexion, does not know it themselves, feeling as if they exist but also don't, as if dead but also alive, having a form without a form, difficult to discern their state of mind. Yellow Emperor said: Excellent!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝問於歧伯曰：余聞之，見其色，知其病，命曰明。按其脈，知其病，命曰神。問其病，知其處，命曰工。余願聞見而知之，按而得之，問而極之，為之奈何？
The Yellow Emperor asked Huang Di, saying: I have heard of it, seen its appearance, and recognized its disease, which is called clear. By palpating the pulse, I recognize its disease, which is called spirit. By inquiring about its disease, I know where it is located, which is called skilled. I wish to hear and see in order to know it, touch and obtain it, ask and be extremely proficient. How can this be accomplished?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯答曰：夫色脈與尺之相應也，如桴鼓影響之相應也，不得相失也，此亦本末根葉之出候也，故根死則葉枯矣。色脈形肉，不得相失也。故知一則為工，知二則為神，知三則神且明矣。
Hu Bo replied: The relationship between color, pulse, and the meridians is similar to that between oars and drums, with echoes and influences. They must not be allowed to lose each other. This is an indication of the roots, stems, branches, and leaves coming into play. Therefore, when the root dies, the leaves will wither. Color, pulse, and form correspond to the flesh; they must not be allowed to lose each other. Knowing one is a skill, knowing two is spirit, and knowing three is both skillful and clear. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯答曰：色青者，其脈弦也，赤者，其脈鉤也，黃者，其脈代也，白者，其脈毛，黑者，其脈石。見其色而不得其脈，反得其相勝之脈，則死矣；得其相生之脈，則病已矣。
Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about it. Huzhou Bo replied: The green one is the sinew vessel, the red one is the hook vessel, the yellow one is the conduit vessel, the white one is the fur vessel, and the black one is the stone vessel. If one sees its color but cannot obtain its vessel, and succeeds in finding its corresponding strong vessel, then it will be fatal; if one obtains its corresponding vital vessel, then the illness will have passed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝問於歧伯曰：五藏之所生，變化之病形何如？
The Yellow Emperor asked Guan Pu: How do the manifestations of diseases resulting from the five organs change?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯答曰：先定其五色五脈之應，其病乃可別也。
Opposition Master replied: First determine the correspondence of the five colors and five pulses, then the disease can be distinguished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：色脈已定，別之奈何？
Yellow Emperor said: Once the pulse is determined, how can one differentiate it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯說：調其脈之緩、急、小、大、滑、澀，而病變定矣。
Bo Yu said: By adjusting the pulse in terms of slackness, urgency, smallness, largeness, slipperiness, and turbidity, one can determine the nature of the disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：調之奈何？歧伯答曰：脈急者，尺之皮膚亦急；脈緩者，尺之皮膚亦緩；脈小者，尺之皮膚亦減而少氣；脈大者，尺之皮膚亦賁而起；脈滑者，尺之皮膚亦滑；脈澀者，尺之皮膚亦澀。凡此變者，有微有甚。故善調尺者，不待於寸，善調脈者，不待於色。能參合而行之者，可以為上工，上工十全九。行二者，為中工，中工十全七。行一者，為下工，下工十全六。
Yellow Emperor asked, How does one adjust it (the pulse)? Duke of Shao replied, If the pulse is rapid, the skin at the wrist is also tense; if the pulse is slow, the skin at the wrist is also relaxed; if the pulse is weak, the skin at the wrist is lessened and there is deficient Qi; if the pulse is full, the skin at the wrist is also distended; if the pulse is slippery, the skin at the wrist is also slippery; if the pulse is choppy, the skin at the wrist is also choppy. Any change in these should be subtle or obvious. Thus, a skilled practitioner of measuring the pulse does not rely on the inch, and a skilled practitioner of palpating the pulse does not rely on the color. He who can apply and blend and work skillfully can become a master craftsman, a master craftsman is ten parts complete out of nine. Those who can work in two (methods) are masters of middle rank, a master of middle rank is seven parts complete out of ten. Those who can work in one (method) are masters at the lower level, a master at the lower level is six parts complete out of ten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：請問脈之緩、急，小、大，滑、澀之病形何如？
The Yellow Emperor asked, How do diseases manifest when the pulse is slow or rapid, weak or strong, slippery or sticky?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯曰：臣請言五藏之病變也。心脈急甚者為瘈瘲；徵急，為心痛引背，食不下。緩甚，為狂笑；微緩，為伏梁，在心下，上下行，時唾血。大甚，為喉吤；微大，為心痺引背，善淚出。小甚為善噦；微小為消病。滑甚為善渴；微滑為心疝，引臍，小腹鳴。澀為為瘖；微澀為血溢，維厥耳鳴，顛疾。
Hu Bo said: I request to speak about the changes in the symptoms of the Five Zang diseases. If the Qi and blood are stagnant, it results in Bi and Yan; if it is urgent, it causes chest pain and referral to the back, making it difficult to eat. If it is severe, it leads to mad laughter; when it is slightly alleviated, it manifests as leaning against a pillar, with ascending and descending movement of Qi, sometimes spitting blood. When it is severe, it causes hoarseness; when it is mildly severe, it results in qi stagnation referring to the back, with an increased tendency to cry. Mild severity leads to difficulty swallowing; when it is slightly mild, it indicates qi obstruction, referring to the throat and abdomen, causing lower abdominal pain. Infiltration leads to discomfort in the muscles and joints; when it is slightly infiltrated, it results in bleeding, tinnitus in the kidney and liver area, and dizziness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>肺脈急甚，為癲疾；微急，為肺寒熱，怠惰，咳唾血，引腰背胸，若鼻息肉不通。緩甚，為多汗；微緩，為痿，痿，偏風，頭以下汗出不可止。大甚，為脛腫；微大，為肺痺，引胸背，起惡見日光。小甚，為泄；微小，為消痺。滑甚，為息賁上氣；微滑，為上下出血。澀甚，為嘔血；微澀，為鼠，在頸支腋之間，下不勝其上，其應善痠矣。
The pulse is rapid and strong, indicating madness; slightly rapid and warm, indicative of lung heat and drowsiness, with coughing up blood, causing pain in the waist, back, and chest, suggesting a blocked nose. If the pulse is slow, it may indicate excessive sweating; if it's just slightly slow, it suggests weakness, paralysis, numbness, or windstroke, with profuse sweating that cannot be stopped from below the head.
If the pulse is strong and rapid, it could indicate swelling of the shins; if it's merely strong, it may point to stagnant lung qi, causing chest and back pain and showing signs of evil under the sunlight. If the pulse is weak and small, it suggests incontinence; if it's just slightly weak, it indicates deficiency and numbness.

<p>When the kidney pulse is urgent and rapid, it indicates bone marrow disease; when it is slightly urgent, it is a sign of impending collapse and running pig; the feet do not recover, and one cannot move forward or backward. When it is moderately urgent, it implies spinal fracture; when it is slightly moderate, there will be a hole, and the food will not transform. The hole refers to the inability to digest food, leading to the gradual expulsion of qi from the lower orifice. In severe cases, this can extend all the way down to the small intestine, causing death that cannot be cured. When it is mildly urgent, it indicates the onset of prolapse; when it is slightly mild, there will be atrophy of the muscles. When it is slippery and urgent, it suggests impotence; when it is slightly slippery, one will have weak bones and will not be able to stand up, and if they do manage to stand, they will see nothing.

<p>黃帝曰：病之六變者，刺之奈何？歧伯答曰：諸急者多寒；緩者多熱；大者多氣少血；小者血氣皆少；滑者陽氣盛，微有熱；澀者多血、少氣，微有寒。是故刺急者，深內而久留之；刺緩者，淺內而疾發鍼，以去其熱；刺大者，微寫其氣，無出其血；刺滑者，疾發鍼而淺內之，以寫其陽氣而去其熱；刺澀者，必中其脈，隨其逆順而久留之，必先按而循之，已發鍼，已按其疝，無令其血出，以和其脈；諸小者，陰陽形氣俱不足，勿取以鍼而調以甘藥也。
Yellow Emperor asked: What about the six variations of disease? How should they be treated by acupuncture? The Duke of Shou replied: In cases of urgency, there are more instances of cold; in cases of slowness, there are more instances of heat; in large ones, there is more qi and less blood; in small ones, both qi and blood are deficient; in slippery ones, there is an abundance of yang qi with a slight amount of heat; in turbid ones, there is more blood and less qi with a slight amount of cold. Therefore, when acupuncturing urgency, one should penetrate deeply and leave it in for a long time; when treating slowness, one should shallowly penetrate and quickly eliminate the needle, to remove the heat; when treating large ones, lightly prick the qi without allowing blood to flow; when treating slippery ones, quickly eliminate the needle while shallowly penetrating, to regulate the yang qi and remove the heat; when treating turbid ones, one must locate the pulse, following its rise and fall, and leave it in for a long time. If the patient is small, both yin and yang qi are deficient; do not resort to acupuncture but use sweet herbs for regulation</p>

Yellow Emperor asked: How should it be taken? Huang Di answered: If it is three li away, one should walk to take it; if it is huge, one should lift the foot to take it; if it is inclined towards Yang, one should bend and stretch to reach for it; if it is central, one should bend to take it; if it is Yang Mound Spring, one should sit with legs extended and straighten posture until reaching the point of inclining towards Yang, then take from there. If the distant source is elsewhere, one should bow and follow it</p>

Huang Di answered: The one with a flushed face and hot feet suffers from a Yang Ming disease, the one with fishnet-like blood vessels in their hands has a hand Yang Ming disease, and the one with an upright pulse at the ankles has a foot Yang Ming disease, which is also known as the Stomach channel.</p>

<p>大腸病者，腸中切痛，而鳴濯濯。冬日重感於寒即泄，當臍而痛，不能久立，與胃同候，取巨虛上廉。
A person with large intestine disease has pain and cramping in the gut, accompanied by a gurgling sound. On cold winter days, it becomes heavier and more urgent to release, causing pain when pressing on it, unable to stand for long periods of time. This condition is associated with the spleen, so treatment should focus on addressing the deficiency and excess in the large intestine and spleen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>胃病者，腹䐜脹，胃脘當心而痛，上肢兩脅，膈咽不通，食飲不下，取之三里也。

In the case of someone with a small intestine disease, there is abdominal pain and back pain that hurts when pressing on the inguinal ligament. Sometimes there is heat behind the ear, if it's very cold, or there's heat on one shoulder, and heat between the little finger and the ring finger. If the pulse is sunken, this is the condition. This is a disease of the hand Jupiter (Large Intestine) Meridian, and it is treated by needing at the lower end of the arm pit.</p>

<li>
<p>三焦病者，腹氣滿，小腹尤堅，不得小便，窘急，溢則水留，即為脹。候在足太陽之外大絡，大絡在太陽少陽之間，亦見于脈，取委陽。
In the case of a patient with a disease of San Jiao, the abdominal Qi is full, the lower abdomen is very tense, and they are unable to urinate. This leads to a sense of urgency, and if there is overflow, this can result in an edema. The pulse should be taken at the outside of the foot Jue Yin, with the Jue Yin located between the Shao Yang points, and also seen in the pulses, by palpating the Wen Yang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>膀胱病者，小腹偏腫而痛，以手按之，即欲小便而不得，肩上熱，若脈陷，及足小指外廉及脛踝後皆熱，若脈陷，取委中央。
Patients with bladder disease have a painful, distended lower abdomen. When they press on it, they feel like they need to urinate but can't. They also have feverish symptoms in their shoulders and a weak pulse. Additionally, the areas around the small toe, ankle, and heel are hot, and if the pulse is weak, administer a centralized tonic.</p>

<li>
<p>膽病者，善太息，口苦，嘔宿汁，心下淡淡，恐人將捕之，嗌中吤吤然數唾。在足少陽之本末，亦視其脈之陷下者灸之；其寒熱者取陽陵泉。

<li>
<p>黃帝曰：刺之有道乎？歧伯答曰：刺此者，必中氣穴，無中肉節。中氣穴，則鍼游於巷；中肉節，即皮膚痛；補寫反，則病益篤。中筋則筋緩，邪氣不出，與其真相搏亂而不去，反還內著。用鍼不審，以順為逆也。
Yellow Emperor asked: Is there a method for acupuncture? The Duke of Shou replied: To acupuncture this point, one must hit the energy channel and not the flesh joints. Hitting the energy channel, the needle will dance in the alley; hitting the flesh joints, the skin and flesh will hurt; if you correct your position, the disease will become more stable. If you hit the tendon, the tendon will become slack, and the pathogenic Qi will not come out; it will be difficult to dispel the true manifestation, and instead return to the interior. The use of acupuncture is not straightforward. It uses reverse as forward, and forward as reverse.</p>
