<h1 id="_1">五運行大論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝坐明堂，始正天綱，臨觀八極，考建五常，請天師而問之曰：論言天地之動靜，神明為之紀，陰陽之升降，寒暑彰其兆。余聞五運之數於夫子，夫子之所言，正五氣之各主歲爾，首甲定運，余因論之。鬼臾區曰：土主甲己，金主乙庚，水主丙辛，木主丁壬，火主戊癸。子午之上，少陰主之。丑未之上，太陰主之。寅申之上，少陽主之。卯酉之上，陽明主之。辰戌之上，太陽主之。巳亥之上，厥陰主之。不合陰陽，其故何也。歧伯曰：是明道也，此天地之陰陽也。夫數之可數者，人中之陰陽也，然所合數之可得者也。夫陰陽者，數之可十，推之可百，數之可千，推之可萬。天地陰陽者，不以數推以象之謂也。
The Yellow Emperor sat in the Hall of Illumination and first established the principles, observed the Eight Poles, investigated the Five Constants, and asked the celestial master about it. The subject was discussing the movement and rest of heaven and earth, recording the activities of spirits, and examining the rise and fall of yin and yang, clearly revealing the signs of cold and heat. I have heard that the five phases are spoken of by Confucius, and Confucius' words are in accord with the regulation of the five forces each year. Therefore, based on this, Guidi Zone said: The earth is ruled by yin, metal is governed by yin in the years of ji and geng; gold is ruled by yin in the years of ren and geng; water is governed by yin in the years of bing and ding; wood is governed by yin in the years of wu and xin; fire is governed by yin in the years of jia and yi. In the day of yang, the lesser yang prevails. At night, the greater yin prevails. During the day of xu, the yin spirit prevails. During the night of chou, the great yin prevails. During the day of bing, the hidden yin prevails. Why do yin and yang not harmonize? Tongwang said: This is due to the understanding of the clear way, which is the yin and yang of heaven and earth. The numbers can be counted among people, but the harmony of yin and yang cannot be calculated. Yin and yang can reach ten in numbers, be pushed to a hundred, and be pushed to a thousand, but the yin and yang of heaven and earth are not measured by numbers but by signs.</p>
<p>2: 帝曰：願聞其所始也。歧伯曰：昭乎哉問也。臣覽《太始天元冊》文，丹天之氣經于牛女戊分，黅天之氣經于心尾己分，蒼天之氣經于危室柳鬼，素天之氣經于亢氐昴畢，玄天之氣經于張翼婁胃。所謂戊己分者，奎壁角軫，則天地之門戶也。夫候之所始，道之所生，不可不通也。
The emperor said, I wish to hear its beginning. Duke Mu replied, How bright it is! I have read the text of the 'Great Beginning of Heaven and Earth,' and the vital energy of Dan Tian is at the Ox's Mansion in the Wu division, the vital energy of Huan Tian is at the end of the heart in the JI division, the vital energy of Bian Tian is at the precipice in the Liu ghost, the vital energy of Su Tian is at the rising point of Tou Yin and the end of Ba, the vital energy of Xuan Tian is at the Zhang Wing Luo's abdomen. The Wu and JI divisions are at the corners of the arch, which are the doors of heaven and earth. Since the changes have their beginning, and the Dao has its origin, it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>3: 帝曰：善論言天地者，萬物之上下，左右者，陰陽之道路，未知其所謂也。歧伯曰：所謂上下者，歲上下見陰陽之所在也。左右者，諸上見厥陰，左少陰右太陽。見少陰，左太陰右厥陰。見太陰，左少陽右少陰。見少陽，左陽明右大陰。見陽明，左太陽右少陽。見太陽，左厥陰右陽明。所謂面北而命其位，言其見也。帝曰：何謂下。歧伯曰：厥陰在上則少陽在下，左陽明右太陰。少陰在上則陽明在下，左太陽右少陽。太陰在上則太陽在下，左厥陰右陽明。少陽在上則厥陰在下，左少陰右太陽。陽明在上則少陰在下，左太陰右厥陰。太陽在上則太陰在下，左少陽右少陰。所謂面南而命其位，言其見也。上下相遘，寒暑相臨，氣相得則和，不相得則病。帝曰：氣相得而病者，何也。歧伯曰：以下臨上，不當位也。帝曰：動靜何如。歧伯曰：上者右行，下者左行，左右周天餘而復會也。帝曰：余聞鬼臾區曰：應地者靜。今夫子乃言下者左行，不知其所謂也，願聞何以生之乎。歧伯曰：天地動靜，五行遷復，雖鬼臾區其上候而已，猶不能徧明。夫變化之用，天垂象，地成形，七曜緯虛，五行麗地。地者，所以載生成之形類也。虛者，所以列應天之精氣也。形精之動，猶根本之與枝葉也，仰觀其象，雖遠可知也。
Emperor said: I have heard much about discussing the nature of heaven and earth, the arrangement of up and down, left and right, and the path of yin and yang. However, I still do not know what it means. Zhong Feng replied: By up and down, we refer to seeing where yin and yang are found in a year's cycle. As for left and right, when looking at above, we see that the left is Shao Yin and the right is Tai Yang. When looking at Shao Yin, the left is Tai Yin and the right is Jue Yin. When looking at Tai Yin, the left is Shao Hong and the right is Shao Yin. When looking at Shao Hong, the left is Yang Ming and the right is Da Yin. When looking at Yang Ming, the left is Tai Yang and the right is Shao Hong. When looking at Tai Yang, the left is Jue Yin and the right is Yang Ming. By facing north, we determine its position; this refers to seeing it. Emperor asked: What do you mean by down? Zhong Feng replied: If Jue Yin is above, then Shao Hong is below, with Tai Yang on the left and Da Yin on the right. If Shao Yin is above, then Yang Ming is below, with Tai Yang on the left and Jue Yin on the right. If Tai Yin is above, then Tai Yang is below, with Jue Yin on the left and Yang Ming on the right. If Shao Hong is above, then Jue Yin is below, with Shao Yin on the left and Tai Yang on the right. If Yang Ming is above, then Shao Yin is below, with Tai Yin on the left and Jue Yin on the right. If Tai Yang is above, then Tai Yin is below, with Jue Yin on the left and Shao Hong on the right. By facing south, we determine its position; this refers to seeing it. Up and down complement each other, while cold and heat follow in turn, allowing the qi to harmonize and causing disease if they do not. Emperor asked: What is it when the qi are harmonious but still cause disease? Zhong Feng replied: When yin is below and yang is above, it is not properly positioned. Emperor asked: How about the dynamic and static aspects? Zhong Feng replied: Above moves to the right, while below moves to the left, circling heaven and earth and returning to the beginning. Emperor said: I have heard that in the Lingbao Scripture, it says appropriate to the land. Now, Master Zhong Feng has spoken of the concept of below as moving to the left, but I still do not understand what you mean, and I wish to hear how it generates life. Zhong Feng replied: The movement of heaven and earth, the transformation of the five phases, although the Lingbao Scripture provides a pattern for this, it cannot fully illuminate the matter. The utility of change lies in the refining power of heaven, the shaping force of earth, and the interweaving of the seven celestial stems and the empty spaces within the five phases. Earth supports the generation and manifestation of the myriad forms of life. Emptiness is what allows the celestial qi to be distributed. The movement of form and qi is like the root and branches, which can be observed from afar if one studies their patterns.</p>
<p>4: 帝曰：地之為下，否乎。歧伯曰：地為人之下，太虛之中者也。帝曰：馮乎。歧伯曰：大氣舉之也。燥以乾之，暑以蒸之，風以動之，濕以潤之，寒以堅之，火以溫之。故風寒在下，燥熱在上，濕氣在中，火遊行其閒，寒暑六入，故令虛而生化也。故燥勝則地乾，暑勝則地熱，風勝則地動，濕勝則地泥，寒勝則地裂，火勝則地固矣。
The Emperor said: Is it below? Hui Bó said: The ground is below, referring to the extremely subtle. The Emperor said: Ah. Hui Bó said: It is raised by the great Qi. It dries with Qian, heats with Ding, moves with Xun, moistens with Rich, strengthens with Zhen, and warms with Li. Therefore, cold and heat are below, dryness above, moisture in the middle, fire freely moves about, cold and heat enter six times, hence it is born from emptiness. Therefore, if dryness prevails, the ground becomes dry; if heat prevails, the ground becomes hot; if wind prevails, the ground becomes moving; if moisture prevails, the ground becomes muddy; if cold prevails, the ground cracks; if fire prevails, the ground hardens.</p>
<p>5: 帝曰：天地之氣，何以候之。歧伯曰：天地之氣，勝復之作，不形於診也。《脈法》曰：天地之變，無以脈診，此之謂也。帝曰：閒氣何如。歧伯曰：隨氣所在，期於左右。帝曰：期之柰何。歧伯曰：從其氣則和，違其氣則病，不當其位者病，迭移其位者病，失守其位者危，尺寸反者死，陰陽交者死。先立其年，以知其氣，左右應見，然後乃可以言死生之逆順。
Emperor: What is the qi of heaven and earth like? How can it be used to predict? Hui Bao: The qi of heaven and earth is the master of change, and does not take shape in divination. (The Classic of Pulse) says: There is no way to divine the changes of heaven and earth through the pulse; this is what it refers to. Emperor: What is the idle qi like? Hui Bao: It follows where the qi is, and waits to the left or right. Emperor: How long should one wait? Hui Bao: If it is in harmony with the qi, it is healthy; if it deviates from the qi, it is sick. If someone is not in their proper place, they are sick. If they keep changing places, they are in danger. If the pulse is reversed, they will die. If yin and yang are mixed up, they will die. First, establish their age to understand their qi, and then the left and right should be observed. Only then can one speak of the order of life and death.</p>
<p>6: 帝曰：寒暑燥濕風火，在人合之柰何，其於萬物，何以生化。歧伯曰：東方生風，風生木，木生酸，酸生肝，肝生筋，筋生心。其在天為玄，在人為道，在地為化。化生五味，道生智，玄生神，化生氣。神在天為風，在地為木，在體為筋，在氣為柔，在藏為肝。其性為暄，其德為和，其用為動，其色為蒼，其化為榮，其蟲毛，其政為散，其令宣發，其變摧拉，其眚為隕，其味為酸，其志為怒。怒傷肝，悲勝怒，風傷肝，燥勝風，酸傷筋，辛勝酸。
The Emperor asked: Cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind - how do they interact with humans? What role do they play in the myriad things, by which do they give rise to life? The Duke of Ting replied: In the east there is wind; wind gives rise to wood; wood gives rise to sourness; sourness gives rise to the liver; the liver gives rise to tendons; tendons give rise to the heart. It exists in Heaven as mystery, in humans as the Way, and on Earth as transformation. Transformation gives rise to the five flavors, the Way gives rise to wisdom, mystery gives rise to spirit, and transformation gives rise to Qi. Spirit exists in Heaven as wind, on Earth as wood, within the body as tendons, within Qi as softness, and in the storehouse as the liver. Its nature is expansive; its virtue is harmonious; its function is movement; its color is blue; its transformation is glory; its insects and hairs are dispersed; its decree is announced and broadcasted; its changes are broken; its shadow is a meteor; its flavor is sour; its will is anger. Anger injures the liver, sorrow surpasses anger, wind injures the liver, dryness surpasses wind, sourness injures muscles, bitter surpasses sour.</p>
<p>7: 南方生熱，熱生火，火生苦，苦生心，心生血，血生脾。其在天為熱，在地為火，在體為脈，在氣為息，在藏為心。其性為暑，其德為顯，其用為躁，其色為赤，其化為茂，其蟲羽，其政為明，其令鬱蒸，其變炎爍，其眚燔焫，其味為苦，其志為喜。喜傷心，恐勝喜，熱傷氣，寒勝熱，苦傷氣，鹹勝苦。
In the southern regions, warmth is generated, heat generates fire, fire generates bitterness, bitterness generates the heart, the heart generates blood, and blood generates the spleen. It is in heaven as warmth, on earth as fire, within the body as the pulse, in the breath as exhalation, and in the storehouse as the heart. Its nature is heat, its virtue is manifestation, its function is agitation, its color is red, its transformation is luxuriance, its insects and feathers, its governance is clarity, its will makes the world steamy, its changes are fiery and scorching, its focus refines and consumes, its taste is bitter, and its intention is joy. Joy injures the heart, fear surpasses joy, heat injures the breath, cold prevails over heat, bitterness injures the breath, saltiness surpasses bitterness.</p>
<p>8: 中央生濕，濕生土，土生甘，甘生脾，脾生肉，肉生肺。其在天為濕，在地為土，在體為肉，在氣為充，在藏為脾。其性靜兼，其德為濡，其用為化，其色為黃，其化為盈，其蟲倮。其政為謐，其令雲雨，其變動注，其眚淫潰，其味為甘，其志為思。思傷脾，怒勝思，濕傷肉，風勝濕，甘傷脾，酸勝甘。
The central essence is humid, the humid essence is earthy, the earthy essence is sweet, the sweet essence nourishes the spleen, the spleen generates flesh, and flesh generates lungs. It is in heaven as humidity, on earth as soil, within the body as flesh, in the Qi as fullness, and in the storehouse as the spleen. Its nature is tranquil and complete, its virtue is moistening, its function is transformation, its color is yellow, its transformation is abundant, and its insects are plentiful. Its governance is moderate, its decree is cloud rain, its changes are regulated, its exuberance is suppressed, its flavor is sweet, and its will is thinking. Thinking injures the spleen, anger surpasses thought, humidity injures flesh, wind surpasses humidity, sweet injures the spleen, sour surpasses sweet.</p>
<p>9: 西方生燥，燥生金，金生辛，辛生肺，肺生皮毛，皮毛生腎。其在天為燥，在地為金，在體為皮毛，在氣為成，在藏為肺，其性為涼，其德為清，其用為固，其色為白，其化為斂，其蟲介，其政為勁，其令霧露，其變肅殺，其眚蒼落，其味為辛，其志為憂。憂傷肺，喜勝憂，熱傷皮毛，寒勝熱，辛傷皮毛，苦勝辛。

In heaven it is associated with dryness, on earth it is associated with metal, in the body it is associated with skin and hair, in the energy it is associated with completion, in the storehouse it is associated with lung, its nature is cool, its virtue is clear, its function is to solidify, its color is white, its transformation is to heal, its insects are exterminated, its politics is forceful, its decree is misty dew, its change is solemn and deadly, its appearance is blue-gray falling, its flavor is bitter, its will is sorrow. Sorrow injures the lung, joy conquers sorrow, heat injures skin and hair, cold conquers heat, cinnabar injures skin and hair, bitterness conquers cinnabar.</p>
<p>10: 北方生寒，寒生水，水生鹹，鹹生腎，腎生骨髓，髓生肝。其在天為寒，在地為水，在體為骨，在氣為堅，在藏為腎，其性為凜，其德為寒，其用為，其色為黑，其化為肅，其蟲鱗，其政為靜，其令，其變凝冽，其眚冰雹，其味為鹹，其志為恐。恐傷腎，思勝恐，寒傷血，燥勝寒，鹹傷血，甘勝鹹。
In the north, there is cold generation; cold generates water; water generates saltiness; saltiness generates kidney, and kidney generates bone marrow; bone marrow generates liver.

Fear injures the kidney, thinking of victory over fear, cold injures blood, drying prevails over cold, saltiness injures blood, sweetness prevails over saltiness.</p>
<p>11: 氣更立，各有所先，非其位則邪，當其位則正。帝曰：病生之變何如。歧伯曰：氣相得則微，不相得則甚。帝曰：主歲何如。歧伯曰：氣有餘，則制己所勝而侮所不勝，其不及，則己所不勝侮而乘之，己所勝輕而侮之。侮反受邪，侮而受邪，寡於畏也。帝曰：善。
When one's qi is strong, each has their own superiority; if not in position, it is evil, and if in position, it is righteous. The emperor asked: What changes occur when illness arises? Zhouzi said: When the qi harmonizes, it is subtle, and when they do not harmonize, it is severe. The emperor asked: How does one handle a crisis year? Zhouzi said: If there is an abundance of qi, one governs oneself by excelling where one is not strong and ignoring where one is weak; if one cannot do so, one ignores where one is weak and takes advantage of where one is strong, but treats the strong areas lightly and ignores them. Ignoring leads to evil, taking advantage of the weak while ignoring the strong also leads to evil; fearing this is the least among faults. The emperor said: Good.</p>
