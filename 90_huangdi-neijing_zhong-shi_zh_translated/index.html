<h1 id="_1">終始</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>凡刺之道，畢於終始，明知終始，五藏為紀，陰陽定矣。陰者主藏，陽者主府，陽受氣於四末，陰受氣於五藏，故寫者迎之，補者隨之，知迎知隨，氣可令和，和氣之方，必通陰陽。五藏為陰，六府為陽，傳之後世，以血為盟。敬之者昌，慢之者亡。無道行私，必得夭殃。
Regarding the needle art, it comes to an end and a beginning, knowing its end and beginning, the five organs serve as records, and yin and yang are established. The yin governs the organs, while the yang governs the palace. Yin receives qi at the four extremities, and yang receives qi at the five organs; therefore, the writer approaches it and the supplementer follows it. Knowing how to approach and knowing how to follow, one can regulate the qi, and the method of regulating qi depends on the harmony of yin and yang. The five organs represent yin, and the six palaces represent yang. This was transmitted for future generations and sealed with blood. Those who revered it prospered, while those who disparaged it perished. Without a path, practicing in secret will inevitably lead to ruin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>謹奉天道，請言終始。終始者，經脈為紀。持其脈口人迎，以知陰陽有餘不足，平與不平，天道畢矣。所謂平人者不病，不病者，脈口人迎應四時也，上下相應而俱往來也，六經之脈不結動也，本末之寒溫之相守司也。形肉血氣必相稱也，是謂平人。少氣者，脈口人迎俱少，而不稱尺寸也。如是者，則陰陽俱不足，補陽則陰竭，寫陰則陽脫。如是者，可將以甘藥，不可飲以至劑，如此者弗灸。不巳者因而寫之，則五藏氣壞矣。
Respecting the Way of Heaven, attending to speech from beginning to end. The one who attends from beginning to end is recorded in the classics as a memorial. Holding the pulse and asking people to greet it, one can know whether there is excess or deficiency of yin and yang, whether it is balanced or unbalanced, and the Way of Heaven is finished. What is meant by a balanced person is that he does not fall ill; when there is no illness, one's pulse and greeting are in harmony with the four seasons, both going to and fro, and the six channels do not move. The pulse reflects the correspondence between yin and yang's extremes, the balance of cold and heat. The body's form, flesh, blood, and qi must correspond and be harmonious; this is what is meant by a balanced person. If there is insufficient qi, the pulse and greeting will also be insufficient, not measuring their dimensions. When this happens, both yin and yang are deficient, supplementing yang will deplete yin, and writing yin will cause yang to disappear. Such a situation should be treated with sweet wormwood; one cannot drink it as an emetic, lest one blister from the moxa stick. Not moxa-ing on the day of Jupiter will cause damage to the five viscera's qi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>人迎一盛，病在足少陽，一盛而躁，病在手少陽。人迎二盛，病在足太陽，二盛而躁，病在手太陽，人迎三盛，病在足陽明，三盛而躁，病在手陽明。人迎四盛，且大且數，名曰溢陽，溢陽為外格。
When a person has a Dampness-Heat attack, it is called Yang Ming. When Dampness-Heat is in the foot's Shao Yang channel, there will be agitation and pain in the hand's Shao Yang channel. If the condition worsens, it is called Jue Yin, which belongs to the exterior. 
For a person having a Dampness-Heat attack, it is called Yang Ming. When Dampness-Heat is in the foot's Tai Yang channel, there will be agitation and pain in the hand's Tai Yang channel. If the condition worsens further, it is called Tai Yin, which belongs to the exterior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>脈口一盛，病在足厥陰；厥陰一盛而躁，在手心主。脈口二盛，病在足少陰；二盛而躁，在手少陰。脈口三盛，病在足太陰；三盛而躁，在手太陰。脈口四盛，且大且數者，名曰溢陰。溢陰為內關，內關不通，死不治。人迎與太陰脈口俱盛四倍以上，名曰關格。關格者，與之短期。
In the following text, the terms 脈口 and 盛 refer to a point in the pulse where it is full or swollen. The term 病在 means the disease is located at, and 而躁 refers to a restless or agitated pulse. The term 溢陰 refers to an excess of yin energy, while 關格 indicates a blockage in the flow of Qi (pronounced chee) energy, which can lead to serious consequences if not treated promptly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>人迎一盛，寫足少陽而補足厥陰，二寫一補，日一取之，必切而驗之，疏取之，上氣和乃止。人迎二盛，寫足太陽補足少陰，二寫一補，二日一取之，必切而驗之，疏取之，上氣和乃止。人迎三盛，寫足陽明而補足太陰，二寫一補，日二取之，必切而驗之，疏取之，上氣和乃止。
One batch: write yang and supplement yin, two writings and one supplement, take once a day, cut and check it, take out the sediment, rise gas is harmonious and stops. Two batches: write yang of great yang and supplement yin, two writings and one supplement, take once a day, cut and check it, take out the sediment, rise gas is harmonious and stops. Three batches: write yang and brightness and supplement great yin, two writings and one supplement, take twice a day, cut and check it, take out the sediment, rise gas is harmonious and stops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>脈口一盛，寫足厥陰而補足少陽，二補一寫，日一取之，必切而驗之，疏而取，上氣和乃止。脈口二盛，寫足少陰而補足太陽，二補一寫，二日一取之，必切而驗之，疏取之，上氣和乃止。脈口三盛，寫足太陰而補足陽明，二補一寫，日二取之，必切而驗之，疏而取之，上氣和乃止。所以日二取之者，太、陽主胃，大富於穀氣，故可日二取之也。
When the pulse is full and round, write the foot yin and supplement the foot taiyang, with both being one. Take it once a day, cutting and verifying it, taking it lightly, and the ascending qi will be harmonious and cease. When the pulse is full and double round, write the foot shao yin and supplement the foot taiyang, both being one. Take it twice a day, cutting and verifying it, taking it lightly, and the ascending qi will be harmonious and cease. When the pulse is full and triple round, write the foot taiyang and supplement the foot jingming, both being one. Take it once every two days, cutting and verifying it, taking it lightly, and the ascending qi will be harmonious and cease. Therefore, those who take it twice a day are governed by taiyin and shangqi, abundant in grain qi, so they can take it twice a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>人迎與脈口俱盛三倍以上，命曰陰陽俱溢，如是者不開，則血脈閉塞，氣無所行，流淫於中，五藏內傷。如此者，因而灸之，則變易而為他病矣。
When the pulse at both wrists is full and abundant, threefold or more, and the name is Yin and Yang overflowing, if this person does not open (the body), the blood vessels will be blocked, the Qi will have no place to go, causing leakage and dysfunction in the internal organs. If such a case arises, acupuncture can be used, and the condition may change into another illness altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡刺之道，氣調而止，補陰寫陽，音氣益彰，耳目聰明。反此者，血氣不行。
Anyone who practices acupuncture must be skillful in regulating the qi, complementing yin and writing yang, making the sounds and Qi more prominent, and having sharp ears and eyes. If not, the blood and qi will not flow properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>所謂氣至而有效者，寫則益虛，虛者，脈大如其故而不堅也；堅如其故者，適雖言故，病未去也。補則益實，實者，脈大如其故而益堅也；夫如其故而不堅者，適雖言快，病未去也。故補則實、寫則虛，痛雖不隨鍼，病必衰去。必先通十二經脈之所生病，而後可得傳於終始矣。故陰陽不相移，虛實不相傾，取之其經。
Regarding those who are skilled in Qi and effective, if they write prescriptions, these will be more vacuous; the vacuous, their pulse is large but not firm, while the firm as per usual, the speech is appropriate but the disease has not yet departed. If one supplements, then there is more substance; the substantial, their pulse is large and firm, but they are still far from recovery. Therefore, supplementation leads to reality and writing leads to vacuity, even though there is pain that does not follow the needle, the disease must decline. One must first establish the connection between the twelve channels and the illness before it can be transmitted to life and death. Thus, yin and yang should not be interchangeable, and vacuity and substance should not be tilted; one should take this to heart when treating disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡刺之屬，三刺至穀氣，邪僻妄合，陰陽易居，逆順相反，沉浮異處，四時不得，稽留淫泆須鍼而去。故一刺則陽邪出，再刺則陰邪出，三刺則穀氣至，穀氣至而止。所謂穀氣至者，已補而實，已寫而虛，故以知穀氣至也。邪氣獨去者，陰與陽未能調而病知愈也。故曰：補則實，寫則虛，痛雖不隨鍼，病必衰去矣。
Any practitioners of acupuncture, when the three needles are located at the grain spirit, if there is a mix-up between right and wrong, yin and yang being out of balance, opposite directions, then this should be corrected. Therefore, one needle leads to an excess of yang pathogen, two needles lead to an excess of yin pathogen, three needles lead to the arrival of grain spirit, and once the spirit arrives it stops there. The term arrival of the grain spirit refers to something being filled and real, something written down as being empty and void, therefore we can tell when the grain spirit has arrived. When the pathogenic qi leaves on its own, yin and yang have not yet been balanced and the disease is known to be getting better. Therefore it is said: filling leads to reality, writing leads to emptiness, although there may still be pain, the illness will surely decline and disappear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>陰盛而陽虛，先補其陽，後寫其陰而和之。陰虛而陽盛，先補其陰，後寫其陽而和之。
When yin is abundant and yang is deficient, first supplement the yang, then regulate the yin to bring harmony. When yang is abundant and yin is deficient, first supplement the yin, then regulate the yang to bring harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>三脈動於足大趾之間，必審其實虛，虛而寫之，是謂重虛。重虛病益甚。凡刺此者，以指按之，脈動而實且疾者疾寫之，虛而徐者則補之。反此者，病益甚。其動也，陽明在上，厥陰在中，少陰在下。
The three pulses are at the middle of the sole of the foot. It is necessary to discern whether they are strong or weak, and if weak, write them down as heavy weakness. The disease becomes more severe. Whoever inserts a needle here must press with the finger, feeling the pulse to be both strong and rapid; one should then quickly write it down. If it is weak and slow, one should reinforce it. In case of failure, the disease worsens. Its movement is such that the Yang Ming is above, the Yin Shu is in the center, and the Shao Yin is below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>膺俞中膺，背俞中背，肩膊虛者，取之上。
Holding the jade disc in the center, holding the handles at the back, with hollow shoulders, take it up above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>重舌，刺舌柱以鈹鍼也。
Re-tongue, pierce the tongue plate with a needle also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>手屈而不伸者，其病在筋，伸而不屈者，其病在骨，在骨守骨，在筋守筋。
If one's hand cannot bend but is not stiff, the disease lies in the tendons. If one's hand can bend but cannot straighten, the disease lies in the bones. Guard the bones and guard the tendons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>補須一方實，深取之，稀按其痏，以極出其邪氣。一方虛，淺刺之，以養其脈，疾按其痏，無使邪氣得入。邪氣來也緊而疾，穀氣來也徐而和。脈實者深刺之，以泄其氣；脈虛者，淺刺之，使精氣無寫出，以養其脈，獨出其邪氣。
One method is to supplement when necessary, plunge deeply and lightly touch the tongue, using extremes to expel its pathogenic qi. Another method is for those who are deficient, make a shallow puncture and nourish the pulse, pressing lightly on the tongue so that the pathogenic qi does not enter. Pathogenic qi comes quickly and rapidly while true qi comes slowly and harmoniously. For those with a real pulse, plunge deeply to release its qi; for those who are deficient, make a shallow puncture, allowing the essence qi to remain undisturbed so as to nourish the pulse and expel only the pathogenic qi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>刺諸痛者，其脈皆實。
For those experiencing pain, all pulse readings will be genuine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>故曰：從腰以上者，手太陰陽明皆主之；從腰以下者，足太陰陽明皆主之。
It is said: For that which is above the waist, both the Taiyang and Shaoyang channels govern the hands; for that which is below the waist, both the Taiyang and Shaoyang channels govern the feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>病在上者下取之；病在下者高取之；病在頭者取之足；病在腰者取之膕。
If the ailment is located above, take from below; if the ailment is located below, take from above; if the ailment is in the head, take from the foot; if the ailment is in the waist, take from the hip.</p>
</li>

The prohibitions of acupuncture: Do not acupuncture the new, do not acupuncture the old; do not acupuncture when drunk, do not acupuncture when angry; do not acupuncture when tired, do not acupuncture when full; do not acupuncture when hungry, do not acupuncture when thirsty; do not acupuncture when thirsty, do not acupuncture when dry. Fear and dread must regulate the qi; when riding in a vehicle, rest, and then acupuncture after eating; when traveling, sit and rest, then acupuncture after a journey of a thousand miles. All these twelve prohibitions govern the pulse, disperse the qi, and follow the defensive qi and channel qi. By needling at such times, yang diseases enter the yin, and yin diseases manifest as yang, thus reviving the pathogenic qi. Superficial needling should not be used; this is akin to chopping down one's body, corrupting the form, polluting the brain and marrow, causing the fluids to fail to transform, and losing one's qi.</p>
