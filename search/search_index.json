The Yellow Emperor asked Guan Pu, The Qi of the four seasons has different forms, and all diseases arise from some source. What is the method of acupuncture and moxibustion for defining this? Guan Pu replied, The Qi of the four seasons have their respective locations. The method of acupuncture and moxibustion is to find the Qi points. Therefore, in spring, you should take the meridians, blood vessels, and muscles between, with the former being deep and the latter being shallow; in summer, you should take the full meridian and sinews, and separate the skin and subcutaneous tissue; in autumn, you should take the meridian channels. In evil cases, you should take from where they are located; in winter, you should take from the wells and ensure depth.</p> <p>2: \u6eab\u7627\u6c57\u4e0d\u51fa\uff0c\u70ba\u4e94\u5341\u4e5d\u75cf\uff0c\u98a8\u3f77\u819a\u8139\uff0c\u70ba\u4e94\u5341\u4e03\u75cf\u3002\u53d6\u76ae\u819a\u4e4b\u8840\u8005\uff0c\u76e1\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u98e7\u6cc4\u88dc\u4e09\u9670\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u88dc\u9670\u9675\u6cc9\uff0c\u7686\u4e45\u7559\u4e4b\uff0c\u71b1\u884c\u4e43\u6b62\u3002 Sweating is not forthcoming, with 59 degrees of Yin; the complexion is sallow and swollen, at 57 degrees of Yin.

Here's a translation:</p> <p>Constantly feeling pain in the abdomen, gas builds up and presses on the chest, making it difficult to breathe and stand for long. The disease is located in the large intestine, by piercing the intestines at the original site of the 'great emptiness' and three li points. For a small intestinal issue, grip the navel and pull towards the spine, pressing upwards towards the heart. If the disease is in the small intestine, tie the navel and connect it to the spine, running through the liver and lungs, connecting to the heart.

Is this pain related to a new generation? What caused it to be named as such? Huang Di replied: Cold, dry winds and dampness, invading from the outside and acting between layers of flesh, causing a coating that becomes cold, which then accumulates and separates the flesh, leading to pain, and the spirit returns to this area, causing heat, heat resolves the pain, pain dissipates and leads to collapse, collapse triggers paralysis, paralysis occurs as such. Yellow Emperor said: Good. I have now understood it completely. This is not inside the stores, but outside manifesting on the skin, uniquely situated between layers of flesh, where true qi cannot circulate fully, so it is called circumferential paralysis. Therefore, when needling circumferential paralysis, one must first cut along its course below the six channels, observe its emptiness or fullness, and address any blood stagnation blocking the great vessels that do not flow freely and any empty veins causing a sunken pulse, using moxa to open them up. Finally, lead it in a firm, turning manner. Yellow Emperor said: Good. I have now understood completely, and also know how to apply this.

Zhang Bao replied: The heart is the master of the five zang and six fu organs; the eyes are where the conception vessel, the pathway for fluid, gathers. The mouth and nose are the gates of Qi. Therefore, when one feels sorrow or sadness, the heart moves, causing all the zang and fu to shake. When they shake, the conception vessel is affected, opening up the fluid pathway. This leads to tears flowing out. Tears flow because the fluid serves to moisten the channels, so when the fluid pathway opens up, tears are shed; when they do not stop, the fluid is depleted. When the fluid is depleted, Qi cannot be nourished, and without Qi nourishment, one will see nothing with their eyes. Thus it is called losing one's essence. This is from the Lingshui Jing: Treatise on the Celestial Pillar.</p> <p>10: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e4b\u592a\u606f\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6182\u601d\u5247\u5fc3\u7cfb\u6025\uff0c\u5fc3\u7cfb\u6025\u5247\u6c23\u9053\u7d04\uff0c\u7d04\u5247\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u6545\u592a\u606f\u4ee5\u4f38\u51fa\u4e4b\uff0c\u88dc\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u5fc3\u4e3b\uff0c\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u7559\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Why would excessive breathing lead to the loss of Qi? The Duke of Shou replied: When one is anxious and thinking, the heart becomes tense, and when the heart is tense, the meridians become constricted. Constricted meridians are not beneficial, so excessive breathing extends them outward.

If the stomach has heat, the worms move, the stomach becomes relaxed, the stomach relaxes and the spring opens, thus causing the fluidity from below, supplementing the kidney yin.</p> <p>12: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e4b\u8033\u4e2d\u9cf4\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8033\u8005\uff0c\u5b97\u8108\u4e4b\u6240\u805a\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u80c3\u4e2d\u7a7a\u5247\u5b97\u8108\u865b\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u4e0b\u6e9c\uff0c\u8108\u6709\u6240\u7aed\u8005\uff0c\u6545\u8033\u9cf4\uff0c\u88dc\u5ba2\u4e3b\u4eba\uff0c\u624b\u5927\u6307\u722a\u7532\u4e0a\u8207\u8089\u4ea4\u8005\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: What causes the sound in a person's ear? Huang Di replied: The ear is where the primeval Qi gathers, so if the stomach is empty, the primeval Qi will be deficient, causing it to leak. When there is a lack of Qi, one might experience ringing in the ears. To treat this condition, apply pressure with the tip of the thumbnail and the base of the nail on the flesh where the skin meets, as if supplementing the chief organ.</p> <p>13: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e4b\u81ea\u9f67\u820c\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\uff1f\u6b64\u53a5\u9006\u8d70\u4e0a\uff0c\u8108\u6c23\u8f29\u81f3\u4e5f\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u6c23\u81f3\u5247\u9f67\u820c\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u6c23\u81f3\u5247\u9f67\u9830\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u6c23\u81f3\u5247\u9f67\u5507\u77e3\u3002\u8996\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u88dc\u4e4b\u3002 Emperor Yellow said: Why do people grind their tongues? This is due to the rebellious qi rising up, and vital energy reaching a critical point. When deficient yin energy reaches this point, it causes tongue grinding; when deficient yang energy reaches this point, it causes tongue grinding as well; and when yang brightness energy reaches this point, it causes lip grinding.

Thus, if the heart desires bitter, the lungs desire pungent, the liver desires sour, the spleen desires sweet, and the kidneys desire salty, these are the damages caused by the five tastes.

Colors and flavors correspond to the five organs: white corresponds to the lungs, pungent, red corresponds to the heart, bitter, green corresponds to the liver, sour, yellow corresponds to the spleen, sweet, black corresponds to the kidneys, salty, so white corresponds to skin, red corresponds to blood vessels, green corresponds to tendons, yellow corresponds to flesh, and black corresponds to bones.</p> <p>3: \u8af8\u8108\u8005\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u76ee\uff0c\u8af8\u9ad3\u8005\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u8166\uff0c\u8af8\u7b4b\u8005\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u7bc0\uff0c\u8af8\u8840\u8005\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u8af8\u6c23\u8005\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u6b64\u56db\u652f\u516b\u8c3f\u4e4b\u671d\u5915\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u4eba\u81e5\uff0c\u8840\u6b78\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u809d\u53d7\u8840\u800c\u80fd\u8996\uff0c\u8db3\u53d7\u8840\u800c\u80fd\u6b65\uff0c\u638c\u53d7\u8840\u800c\u80fd\u63e1\uff0c\u6307\u53d7\u8840\u800c\u80fd\u651d\u3002\u81e5\u51fa\u800c\u98a8\u5439\u4e4b\uff0c\u8840\u51dd\u65bc\u819a\u8005\u70ba\u75fa\uff0c\u51dd\u65bc\u8108\u8005\u70ba\u6ce3\uff0c\u51dd\u65bc\u8db3\u8005\u70ba\u53a5\u3002\u6b64\u4e09\u8005\uff0c\u8840\u884c\u800c\u4e0d\u5f97\u53cd\u5176\u7a7a\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u75fa\u53a5\u4e5f\u3002\u4eba\u6709\u5927\u8c37\u5341\u4e8c\u5206\uff0c\u5c0f\u8c3f\u4e09\u767e\u4e94\u5341\u56db\u540d\uff0c\u5c11\u5341\u4e8c\u4fde\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u885b\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u7559\u6b62\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u5ba2\u4e5f\uff0c\u937c\u77f3\u7de3\u800c\u53bb\u4e4b\u3002 All the vessels are under the jurisdiction of the eyes; all the marrows are under the jurisdiction of the brain; all the tendons are under the jurisdiction of the bones; all the blood is under the jurisdiction of the heart; all the qi is under the jurisdiction of the lungs. The four limbs and eight vessels change day and night. Therefore, when a person lies down, blood returns to the liver, the liver receives blood and can see, the feet receive blood and can walk, the palms receive blood and can grip, and the fingers receive blood and can grasp. Upon rising from lying down and being exposed to the wind, if the blood congeals at the skin it is a case of rigidity; if it congeals in the vessels it is a case of weeping; if it congeals at the feet it is a case of stroke. These three cases are when the blood fails to return and reverse its pathway, resulting in rigidity and stroke. A person has large intestines divided into twelve parts and small intestines with 354 sections, some of which are missing, all of these being the locations where defensive qi resides and evil qi lodges. Use acupuncture and moxibustion to drive them out.</p> <p>4: \u8a3a\u75c5\u4e4b\u59cb\u4e94\u6c7a\u70ba\u7d00\uff0c\u6b32\u77e5\u5176\u59cb\uff0c\u5148\u5efa\u5176\u6bcd\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u4e94\u6c7a\u8005\u4e94\u8108\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u982d\u75db\u5dd4\u75be\uff0c\u4e0b\u865b\u4e0a\u5be6\u904e\u5728\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u5de8\u967d\u751a\u5247\u5165\u814e\u3002\u5f87\u8499\u62db\u5c24\u76ee\u51a5\u8033\u807e\uff0c\u4e0b\u5be6\u4e0a\u865b\uff0c\u904e\u5728\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u751a\u5247\u5165\u809d\u3002\u8179\u6eff\u441c\u8139\uff0c\u652f\u9b32\u80e0\u8107\uff0c\u4e0b\u53a5\u4e0a\u5192\uff0c\u904e\u5728\u8db3\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u3002\u6b2c\u55fd\u4e0a\u6c23\uff0c\u53a5\u5728\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u904e\u5728\u624b\u967d\u660e\u592a\u9670\u3002\u5fc3\u7169\u982d\u75db\u75c5\u5728\u9b32\u4e2d\uff0c\u904e\u5728\u624b\u5de8\u967d\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u3002 The onset of disease is determined by five signs, and in order to know its origin, one must first investigate its mother. The term five signs refers to the five pulse positions. Therefore, headache with sudden onset, pain that is acute, is due to an excess condition in the foot Shaoyang. If there is a strong excess, it will enter the Spleen. Deafness, blindness, and tinnitus, with internal symptoms and external manifestations, are due to an excess condition in the foot Shao Yang, with a strong Bladder involved, potentially entering the Liver. Abdominal fullness, distension, and constipation, with internal stagnation and external manifestations, is due to a deficiency-excess condition in the foot Taiyin, involving the Yin and Yang of the Stomach. Dysphagia and difficulty speaking, with Qi rising upward, is due to a deficiency-excess condition in the foot Shaoyang, involving the Yin of the Lungs. Heart palpitations and headache, with disease located in the region of the Gallbladder, are due to an excess condition in the Gallbladder, involving the Shao Yang and the foot Shaoyang.</p> <p>5: \u592b\u8108\u4e4b\u5c0f\u5927\u6ed1\u6fc7\u6d6e\u6c88\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6307\u5225\uff1b\u4e94\u85cf\u4e4b\u8c61\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u985e\u63a8\uff1b\u4e94\u85cf\u76f8\u97f3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u610f\u8b58\uff1b\u4e94\u8272\u5fae\u8a3a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76ee\u5bdf\u3002\u80fd\u5408\u8108\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u842c\u5168\u3002\u8d64\u8108\u4e4b\u81f3\u4e5f\u5598\u800c\u5805\uff0c\u8a3a\u66f0\u6709\u7a4d\u6c23\u5728\u4e2d\uff0c\u6642\u5bb3\u65bc\u98df\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5fc3\u75fa\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u5916\u75be\uff0c\u601d\u616e\u800c\u5fc3\u865b\uff0c\u6545\u90aa\u5f9e\u4e4b\u3002\u767d\u8108\u4e4b\u81f3\u4e5f\u5598\u800c\u6d6e\uff0c\u4e0a\u865b\u4e0b\u5be6\u3002\u9a5a\uff0c\u6709\u7a4d\u6c23\u5728\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u5598\u800c\u865b\u540d\u66f0\u80ba\u75fa\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u9189\u800c\u4f7f\u5167\u4e5f\u3002\u9752\u8108\u4e4b\u81f3\u4e5f\u9577\u800c\u5de6\u53f3\u5f48\u6709\u7a4d\u6c23\u5728\u5fc3\u4e0b\u652f\u80e0\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u809d\u75fa\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u5bd2\u6fd5\uff0c\u8207\u759d\u540c\u6cd5\uff0c\u8170\u75db\u8db3\u6e05\u982d\u75db\u3002\u9ec3\u8108\u4e4b\u81f3\u4e5f\u5927\u800c\u865b\uff0c\u6709\u7a4d\u6c23\u5728\u8179\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u53a5\u6c23\u540d\u66f0\u53a5\u759d\uff0c\u5973\u5b50\u540c\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u75be\u4f7f\u56db\u652f\u6c57\u51fa\u7576\u98a8\u3002\u9ed1\u8108\u4e4b\u81f3\u4e5f\u4e0a\u5805\u800c\u5927\u6709\u7a4d\u6c23\u5728\u5c0f\u8179\u8207\u9670\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u814e\u75fa\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u6c90\u6d74\u6e05\u6c34\u800c\u81e5\u3002 Regarding the pulse, its smallness, largeness, smoothness, and turbidity can be distinguished.

How do the intestines and stomach differ in size, length, and capacity? Bo Gao replied: Please proceed with your explanation. The extent of the intestines and stomach in terms of shallow, deep, near or far, long or short is as follows: the lips reach to the teeth and are nine parts long; the mouth is two and a half inches wide; the teeth lead to the heel, which is three and a half inches deep; it is five fists in size; the tongue weighs ten pounds and is seven feet long, two and a half inches wide; the throat weighs ten pounds and is one and a half inches wide; the stomach is one foot six inches long, curved, stretched out, reaching two feet six inches long, three feet five inches in size, five inches in width, and has a capacity of three bushels and five pints. The small intestine adheres to the spine, coils to the left, day after day accumulating, and is connected to the large intestine at the coil. The large intestine is connected to the right side of the abdomen.

Master Qi Bo replied: The clear Qi is in the Yin, and the turbid Qi is in the Yang. Regulating Qi follows the pulse, defending Qi moves against the grain. Clear and turbid are related, causing chaos within. This is called great distress. Therefore, when Qi is chaotic in the heart, the mind becomes restless and anxious, crouching with a hunched back; when it is chaotic in the lungs, one experiences shortness of breath and gasping, grasping for air; when it is chaotic in the stomach and intestines, it is called huo chaos; when it is chaotic in the arms and legs, it results in the four paralyses; when it is chaotic in the head, one experiences dizziness and weakness of the head.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u4e82\u8005\uff0c\u523a\u4e4b\u6709\u9053\u4e4e\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u9053\u4ee5\u4f86\uff0c\u6709\u9053\u4ee5\u53bb\uff0c\u5be9\u77e5\u5176\u9053\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u8eab\u5bf6\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u9858\u805e\u5176\u9053\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u5728\u65bc\u5fc3\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e4b\u4fde\uff1b\u6c23\u5728\u65bc\u80ba\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u624b\u592a\u9670\u6ece\uff0c\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u4fde\uff0c\u6c23\u5728\u65bc\u8178\u80c3\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e09\u91cc\uff0c\u6c23\u5728\u65bc\u982d\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u5929\u67f1\u5927\u677c\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\uff0c\u53d6\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u6ece\u4fde\uff1b\u6c23\u5728\u65bc\u81c2\u8db3\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u5148\u53bb\u8840\u8108\uff0c\u5f8c\u53d6\u5176\u967d\u660e\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u6ece\u8f38\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: What is the way of five chaoses?

The diaphragm is the capital city of the spirit lord; the stomach is the warehouse; the throat and small intestine are the transit centers; the five orifices of the stomach are the market gates; the renal cortex and the adrenal glands are the channels for fluids. Thus, each of the Five Zang Organs and Six Fu Organs has its own boundary, and their diseases have different manifestations. Regulating Qi through the meridians and defending against pathogenic factors through the meridians can cause Qi stagnation or blockage; defending against pathogenic factors through the meridians can also lead to skin blockages.

The method involves rapid writing, nearer to it in one strike, farther away in three strikes. If today it has three strikes but does not fall, where does its error lie? Master Qi Bo replied: This speech is trapped in the flesh and tendons, but it is related to the acupuncture points of the body's vital energy. If you do not hit the acupuncture point, then the vital energy will be blocked inside, the needle will not penetrate the flesh, and the vital energy will not flow, causing disorder between defensive Qi and nutritive Yin, with Yang following Yin. In regard to hacking cough, one should definitely write or not write based on the situation; if the vital energy does not descend because of this, it will not fall even after three strikes, one must change the method, and once the vital energy descends and settles, it will be cured completely, with no risk of recurrence. In regard to hacking cough, one must carefully consider the situation, act accordingly by writing or supplementing [acupuncture points], like a drum responding to a lute; is there any risk of not hitting the mark?</p>"},{"location":"117_huangdi-neijing_wu-long-jin-ye-bie_zh_translated/","title":"\u4e94\u7643\u6d25\u6db2\u5225","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u65bc\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c34\u7a40\u5165\u4e8e\u53e3\uff0c\u8f38\u65bc\u8178\u80c3\uff0c\u5176\u6db2\u5225\u70ba\u4e94\uff0c\u5929\u5bd2\u8863\u8584\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u6eba\u8207\u6c23\uff0c\u5929\u71b1\u8863\u539a\u5247\u70ba\u6c57\uff0c\u60b2\u54c0\u6c23\u4e26\u5247\u70ba\u6ce3\uff0c\u4e2d\u71b1\u80c3\u7de9\u5247\u70ba\u553e\u3002\u90aa\u6c23\u5167\u9006\uff0c\u5247\u6c23\u70ba\u4e4b\u9589\u585e\u800c\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u4e0d\u884c\u5247\u70ba\u6c34\u8139\uff0c\u4f59\u77e5\u5176\u7136\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u4f55\u7531\u751f\uff1f\u9858\u805e\u5176\u9053\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked Yi Yin: Water grains enter the mouth, exit at the stomach and intestines.

Confucius's art, like a river flowing east or west, has no fixed direction. The Yellow Emperor asked about Confucius's study of knowledge, whether it is by scrutinizing objects to generate ideas within oneself? Guan Yu replied: A sage who practices the Way unites with heaven above, earth below, and human affairs in between, surely there is a method to guide the development, which can be established as a standard, and thus can be passed down. Artisans cannot fully reveal their skill in measuring dimensions, yet they create short and long objects skillfully; carpenters cannot establish rules but still achieve roundness and squareness.

Kuang Bo answered: This is not the case, for the Chong vessel is the sea of the Five Zang and Six Fu organs. All five zang and six fu originate from this sea. The upper part comes out from the lips and irrigates Yang; the lower part connects to the Shao Yin's major channel, issuing from Qi Street, follows the inside of the Yin canal, enters the Mingmen, sinks and runs through the Huan Gong, and finally terminates at the rear of the navel. The lower part is also in the Shao Yin channel, irrigating the three Yin; the front part hides and runs out from the tip of the toes, loops around the toes, enters the interspace between the great and second fingers, and irrigates the tendons and muscles. Hence, the branch vessels separate and attach to the upper Jue Ding, which does not move, thus causing Yin, and resulting in coldness. Yellow Emperor said: How can it be explained?

Some say it is stored in a 'palace,' but they all claim that those who do not know its path are daring to express their opinions. I would like to hear your explanation. The Duke answered, The brain, spinal cord, bones, marrow, and gallbladder of women; these six are generated by earth energy and are stored in the yin while manifesting as earthly things. Therefore, they are hidden but not written, and are called the Palace of the Strange [Qi H\u00e9ng]. The large intestine, small intestine, three intestines, bladder; these five are generated by celestial energy and manifest as heavenly things. As a result, their energies are expressed but not hidden. These five organs receive the impure energy of the six organs, which is called the Palace of Transformation [Chu\u00e1n Hz\u00e1]. This palace cannot be preserved and must be written, indicating that these organs have impermanence. The Duke also said that the Gate of Life is one of the five organs, controlling so that water does not linger in the body. The Five Organs are hidden while storing the essence-qi, so they cannot be full. The Six Palaces are where the transformative energies are stored without being hidden, so they can be filled but not made full. This is because when food enters the mouth, the stomach becomes filled and the intestines become empty; when food descends, the intestines become filled and the stomach becomes empty. Therefore, it is said that filled but not full, full but not real.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u53e3\u4f55\u4ee5\u7368\u70ba\u4e94\u85cf\u4e3b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u80c3\u8005\u6c34\u7a40\u4e4b\u6d77\uff0c\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u5927\u6e90\u4e5f\u3002\u4e94\u5473\u5165\u53e3\uff0c\u85cf\u65bc\u80c3\u4ee5\u990a\u4e94\u85cf\u6c23\uff0c\u6c23\u53e3\u4ea6\u592a\u9670\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u6c23\u5473\uff0c\u7686\u51fa\u65bc\u80c3\uff0c\u8b8a\u898b\u65bc\u6c23\u53e3\u3002\u6545\u4e94\u6c23\u5165\u9f3b\uff0c\u85cf\u65bc\u5fc3\u80ba\uff0c\u5fc3\u80ba\u6709\u75c5\u800c\u9f3b\u70ba\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5229\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said: How is the Qi mouth unique as the master of the Five Organs? The Duke of Shou replied: The Stomach is like a sea of water and the source of the six ministries. The five flavors enter through the mouth, where they are stored in the Stomach to nourish the Qi of the Five Organs; the Qi mouth is also part of the Yin aspect. Therefore, the Qi of the Five Organs and Six Ministries all come from the Stomach and manifest through the Qi mouth. As a result, the five Qi enter through the nose and are stored in the Heart and Lungs.

The second month governs the left foot's Tai Yang; the fifth month is governed by the right foot's Tai Yang. The third month governs the left foot's Yang Ming, and the fourth month governs the right foot's Yang Ming. Combining the two Yin in front leads to Yang Ming. In the Xu cycle, the seventh month is the generation of Yin, ruling the right foot's Shao Yin; the twelfth month rules the left foot's Shao Yin. The eighth month governs the right foot's Tai Yin, and the eleventh month governs the left foot's Tai Yin.

One day is divided into four times: morning is spring, noon is summer, afternoon is autumn, and midnight is winter. In the morning, people's vitality begins to emerge, and pathogenic factors wane, thus making it an auspicious time. At noon, people's vitality grows stronger, which helps overcome evil influences. In the evening, people's vitality starts to decline, and pathogenic factors arise, so it is a dangerous period. At midnight, people's vitality is stored and pathogenic factors dominate the body, making it a severe time.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u6642\u6709\u53cd\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u662f\u4e0d\u61c9\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u85cf\u7368\u4e3b\u5176\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u5fc5\u4ee5\u85cf\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u4e0d\u52dd\u6642\u8005\u751a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u6240\u52dd\u6642\u8005\u8d77\u4e5f\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u9806\u5929\u4e4b\u6642\uff0c\u800c\u75c5\u53ef\u8207\u671f\u3002\u9806\u8005\u70ba\u5de5\uff0c\u9006\u8005\u70ba\u9ea4\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: What causes someone to have a counter-seasonal disease?

Those who violate it will suffer the consequences, while those who avoid it will suffer little or none, and this is not something they seek but rather something that happens due to their own actions.</p> <p>2: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e00\u6642\u9047\u98a8\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u5f97\u75c5\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u5404\u7570\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6545\u3002\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u4e4e\u5176\u554f\uff01\u8acb\u8ad6\u4ee5\u6bd4\u5320\u4eba\u3002\u5320\u4eba\u78e8\u65a7\u65a4\uff0c\u792a\u5200\u524a\u65b7\u6750\u6728\u3002\u6728\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5c1a\u6709\u5805\u8106\uff0c\u5805\u8005\u4e0d\u5165\uff0c\u8106\u8005\u76ae\u5f1b\uff0c\u81f3\u5176\u4ea4\u7bc0\uff0c\u800c\u7f3a\u65a4\u65a7\u7109\u3002\u592b\u4e00\u6728\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5805\u8106\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5805\u8005\u5247\u525b\uff0c\u8106\u8005\u6613\u50b7\uff0c\u6cc1\u5176\u6750\u6728\u4e4b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u76ae\u4e4b\u539a\u8584\uff0c\u6c41\u4e4b\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u5404\u7570\u8036\u3002\u592b\u6728\u4e4b\u86a4\u82b1\u5148\u751f\u8449\u8005\uff0c\u9047\u6625\u971c\u70c8\u98a8\uff0c\u5247\u82b1\u843d\u800c\u8449\u840e\uff1b\u4e45\u66dd\u5927\u65f1\uff0c\u5247\u8106\u6728\u8584\u76ae\u8005\uff0c\u679d\u689d\u6c41\u5c11\u800c\u8449\u840e\uff1b\u4e45\u9670\u6deb\u96e8\uff0c\u5247\u8584\u76ae\u591a\u6c41\u8005\uff0c\u76ae\u6f09\u800c\u6dfa\uff1b\u5352\u98a8\u66b4\u8d77\uff0c\u5247\u525b\u8106\u4e4b\u6728\uff0c\u679d\u6298\u674c\u50b7\uff1b\u79cb\u971c\u75be\u98a8\uff0c\u5247\u525b\u8106\u4e4b\u6728\uff0c\u6839\u6416\u800c\u8449\u843d\u3002\u51e1\u6b64\u4e94\u8005\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u50b7\uff0c\u6cc1\u65bc\u4eba\u4e4e\uff01 Yellow Emperor said: At one time, encountering wind and at the same time contracting illness, with various symptoms, I wish to hear of their causes. Shao Yong said: What a good question! Please discuss it by comparing it to a craftsman. The craftsman sharpens an axe, hones a knife, cuts and shapes wood material. The yin and yang of the wood still have hardness and brittleness; the hard one does not enter, while the brittle one is flexible, until reaching the joints where the axe is lacking. Since the hardness and brittleness of one piece of wood are not the same, the hard one is rigid, while the brittle one is easily damaged; how much more for different kinds of wood materials, the thickness of the bark, and the amount of sap, each being different? When the wood's buds sprout before the leaves open, encountering spring frost or strong wind, the flowers fall and the leaves wither. If there is a long drought, then the brittle wood and thin-skinned trees have branches with little sap and their leaves wither; if there is an excessive amount of rain, then the thin-skinned trees with more sap will peel and become shallow-rooted; suddenly encountering strong wind or storms, then the hard and brittle trees have broken branches and damaged trunks; in the autumn, when the frost and wind are rapid, then the hard and brittle trees have shaking roots and their leaves fall. All of these five cases have been harmed; how much more for people!</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4ee5\u4eba\u61c9\u6728\uff0c\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u5c11\u4fde\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u6728\u4e4b\u6240\u50b7\u4e5f\uff0c\u7686\u50b7\u5176\u679d\u3002\u679d\u4e4b\u525b\u8106\u800c\u5805\uff0c\u672a\u6210\u50b7\u4e5f\u3002\u4eba\u4e4b\u6709\u5e38\u75c5\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ea6\u56e0\u5176\u9aa8\u7bc0\u76ae\u819a\u8160\u7406\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5805\u56fa\u8005\uff0c\u90aa\u4e4b\u6240\u820d\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u5e38\u70ba\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: What if a man corresponds to wood, how could that be?

If the skin is thin and the flesh lacks substance, the arms are flabby and limp, the complexion is almost lost, not harmonious with heaven's colors, dirty and unique, this is the sign of their condition.

The Wei qi is used to warm the organs, nourish the skin, and moisturize the muscles and faculties, and control opening and closing. Intention or spirit is what maintains consciousness, collects the soul, adjusts to cold and heat, and harmonizes joy and anger. Therefore, when blood is balanced, the meridians flow smoothly, yin and yang are regulated, tendons and bones have strength, and joints are clear and nourished. When Wei qi is balanced, the muscles distribute and refine, the skin becomes soft and supple, sinews are strengthened, and the organs function properly without being invaded by evil. When intention or spirit is balanced, consciousness is focused and direct, the soul does not scatter, anger does not arise, and the five organs do not suffer from evil influences. Cold and heat are balanced, the six departments transform grains and regulate fluids, wind stroke does not occur, and the meridians flow smoothly, and joints are at peace. This is the natural equilibrium of the human body. The five organs house the spirit, blood, and soul. The six departments regulate the transformation of water and grains. This person's ability to receive from heaven is complete, without folly or lack of wisdom. Although they possess an independent longevity that is free from strange diseases and does not wither over a hundred years, even if they encounter wind, rain, sudden cold, or intense heat, they are still unable to be harmed. How can it be that they do not leave their secluded room and are still prone to illness? I wish to know the reason.</p> <p>2: \u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u7a98\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u4e94\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u53c3\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u526f\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u800c\u904b\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u5316\u4e94\u7bc0\u8005\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e94\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u56fa\u6709\u5c0f\u5927\u3001\u9ad8\u4e0b\u3001\u5805\u8106\u3001\u7aef\u6b63\u3001\u504f\u50be\u8005\uff0c\u516d\u5e9c\u4ea6\u6709\u5c0f\u5927\u3001\u9577\u77ed\u3001\u539a\u8584\u3001\u7d50\u76f4\u3001\u7de9\u6025\u3002\u51e1\u6b64\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u8005\uff0c\u5404\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6216\u5584\u6216\u60e1\uff0c\u6216\u5409\u6216\u51f6\uff0c\u8acb\u8a00\u5176\u65b9\u3002 Duke Zhou replied, It is indeed a difficult question.

If they lean on one side, then their heart is inclined.</p> <p>9: \u767d\u8272\u5c0f\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u5c0f\uff1b\u9ea4\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u5927\u3002\u5de8\u80a9\u53cd\u81ba\u9677\u5589\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u9ad8\uff1b\u5408\u814b\u5f35\u8105\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u4e0b\u3002\u597d\u80a9\u80cc\u539a\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u5805\uff1b\u80a9\u80cc\u8584\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u8106\u3002\u80cc\u81ba\u539a\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u7aef\u6b63\uff1b\u8105\u504f\u758f\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u504f\u50be\u4e5f\u3002 One who is small and white, the lungs are small; one with hair, the lungs are large.

It runs through the nine needles and sixty chapters, morning and evening practicing it, close ones weave it up, distant ones simplify the dirt, but it is still not complete in recitation, and it does not fully resolve its meaning. The phrase external weaving refers to a single bundle, and I do not know what this means. A great principle has no outside, and small things have no inside; large and small have no extremes, high and low have no measure, how will they be bound? The abilities of a gentleman may be shallow or deep, wise or simple-minded, unable to be profound and mysterious, and must strive in their studies like Fu Zi. Fu Zi is afraid that it will scatter in later generations and disappear from descendants, daring to ask about the pact. The Huang Di said: How wonderful this question is.

When Cun Kou is two times larger, the illness lies in the lower leg, in the small yin, two times agitated, in the heart of the little finger. When Cun Kou is three times larger, the illness lies in the lower leg, in the great yin, three times agitated, in the heart of the ring finger.

If it is empty, there will be heat, ulceration, deficiency of essence, change of color, tight, and if it changes, there will be pain and numbness. If it is replaced, there will be sudden pain and then cessation. In the swollen state, write it; in the deficient state, supplement it, in the tight state, first puncture and then moxa; in the replaced state, take blood vessels and then regulate it, if sinking down, then moxa; those who sink down have stagnant blood in the middle, with blood congestion in the middle, cold blood, hence moxa is appropriate. Cun Kou four times larger is called Inner Gate (Nei Guan), and the Inner Gate is both large and complicated, without cure if dying.

Therefore, in the eastern region, where heaven and earth were first created, the land of salted fish, near the sea, its people eat salted fish and enjoy saltiness, they are satisfied with their location and enjoy their food. The fish makes people warm and the salt strengthens blood, so the people's complexion is dark, and they often have skin lesions and tumors. Their treatment should be with a touchstone (a type of stone), thus the touchstone comes from the east.</p> <p>2: \u897f\u65b9\u8005\uff0c\u91d1\u7389\u4e4b\u57df\uff0c\u6c99\u77f3\u4e4b\u8655\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u6240\u6536\u5f15\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u6c11\u9675\u5c45\u800c\u591a\u98a8\uff0c\u6c34\u571f\u525b\u5f37\uff0c\u5176\u6c11\u4e0d\u8863\u800c\u8910\u85a6\uff0c\u5176\u6c11\u83ef\u98df\u800c\u8102\u80a5\uff0c\u6545\u90aa\u4e0d\u80fd\u50b7\u5176\u5f62\u9ad4\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u751f\u65bc\u5167\uff0c\u5176\u6cbb\u5b9c\u6bd2\u85e5\uff0c\u6545\u6bd2\u85e5\u8005\uff0c\u4ea6\u5f9e\u897f\u65b9\u4f86\u3002 In the west, there is a realm of gold and jade, a place of sand and stones, where heaven and earth converge and attract.

The people there eat diverse foods without much labor. Therefore, they have many diseases such as weakness, cold, and fever. Treatment should be by guidance and regulation, and manipulation of the joints, which also originate from the central area. Thus, a sage would use diverse methods to treat illnesses, each according to what is appropriate for the individual, so that treatment may differ but all recover.

If the pulse groove is shallow and sinking but still smooth, the illness will progress daily and be internal; if when you greet the breath the pulse is deep and smooth, the illness will progress daily and be external.

Huang Di replied: The color can be used to clarify, but if it is too deep or sinking, there will be a problem; the color moving upward means that the disease is getting worse; the color moving downward is like dispersing clouds, meaning the disease has improved. Each of the five colors has a hidden and an outer part. The color comes from the outer part to the inner part, indicating that the disease comes from the outside to the inside; the color coming from the inner part to the outer part indicates that the disease comes from the inside to the outside. If the disease arises from the inside, first treat the yin and then treat the yang; if it is reversed, it will become worse. If the disease arises from the yang, first treat the outside and then treat the inside; if it is reversed, it will become worse. If the pulse is slippery and large and prolonged, indicating that the disease comes from the outside, there are visible symptoms and aversion to something, this is the confluence of Yang Qi and can be transformed.</p> <p>7: \u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u5c0f\u5b50\u805e\u98a8\u8005\uff0c\u767e\u75c5\u4e4b\u59cb\u4e5f\uff1b\u53a5\u9006\u8005\uff0c\u5bd2\u6fd5\u4e4b\u8d77\u4e5f\uff0c\u5225\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5e38\u5019\u95d5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8584\u6fa4\u70ba\u98a8\uff0c\u6c96\u6fc1\u70ba\u75fa\u3002\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u53a5\u3002\u6b64\u5176\u5e38\u4e5f\uff1b\u5404\u4ee5\u5176\u8272\u8a00\u5176\u75c5\u3002 Lei Gong said: Little one, hearing the sound of wind is the beginning of a hundred diseases; perverse persons are born from cold and dampness.

If there is a black spot the size of a grain of rice appearing in the courtyard, the person will surely die without being ill.</p> <p>9: \u96f7\u516c\u518d\u62dc\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u54c9\uff01\u5176\u6b7b\u6709\u671f\u4e4e\uff1f\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5bdf\u8272\u4ee5\u8a00\u5176\u6642\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u4e4e\uff01\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5ead\u8005\uff0c\u9996\u9762\u4e5f\uff1b\u95d5\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u54bd\u5589\u4e5f\uff1b\u95d5\u4e2d\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e0b\u6975\u8005\uff0c\u5fc3\u4e5f\uff1b\u76f4\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u809d\u4e5f\uff1b\u809d\u5de6\u8005\uff0c\u81bd\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u813e\u4e5f\uff1b\u65b9\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u80c3\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e2d\u592e\u8005\uff0c\u5927\u8178\u4e5f\uff1b\u633e\u5927\u8178\u8005\uff0c\u814e\u4e5f\uff1b\u7576\u814e\u8005\uff0c\u81cd\u4e5f\uff1b\u9762\u738b\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u5c0f\u8178\u4e5f\uff0c\u9762\u738b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u8180\u80f1\u5b50\u8655\u4e5f\uff1b\u9874\u8005\uff0c\u80a9\u4e5f\uff1b\u9874\u5f8c\u8005\uff0c\u81c2\u4e5f\uff1b\u81c2\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u624b\u4e5f\uff1b\u76ee\u5167\u7725\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u81ba\u4e73\u4e5f\uff1b\u633e\u7e69\u800c\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u80cc\u4e5f\uff1b\u5faa\u7259\u8eca\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u80a1\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e2d\u592e\u8005\uff0c\u819d\u4e5f\uff1b\u819d\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u811b\u4e5f\uff1b\u7576\u811b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u8db3\u4e5f\uff1b\u5de8\u5206\u8005\uff0c\u80a1\u88cf\u4e5f\uff1b\u5de8\u5c48\u8005\uff0c\u819d\u81cf\u4e5f\u3002\u6b64\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u80a2\u7bc0\u4e4b\u90e8\u4e5f\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6709\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7528\u9670\u548c\u967d\uff0c\u7528\u967d\u548c\u9670\uff0c\u7576\u660e\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u842c\u8209\u842c\u7576\u3002\u80fd\u5225\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5927\u9053\uff1b\u7537\u5973\u7570\u4f4d\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u9670\u967d\u3002\u5be9\u5bdf\u6fa4\u592d\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u826f\u5de5\u3002 Lei gong again paid his respects and said, Excellent!

Each has its own part. Having parts, using yin and yang, using yang and yin, understanding the parts, everything is clear. Being able to distinguish left and right is called the Great Way; men and women have different positions, so it is called yin and yang.

Thus not knowing if it's correct or incorrect, belong to intention, do not depart from it, then know new matters.

If the skin is thick and the muscle is firm, in the heat of summer there will be scantiness of wind, but it will not become ill.

For the brave, when they see danger, they move forward; when they see pain, they stop. For the cowardly, even if they can bear pain, upon hearing of danger, they are afraid; upon encountering pain, they do not move. For the brave who can bear pain, they are not afraid upon seeing danger and do not move upon encountering pain. For the cowardly who cannot bear pain, they turn their heads in fright, unable to speak, losing breath, being startled, and their complexions change, alternating between near death and life. I have seen this myself, but I do not know why it happens; I wish to hear its cause. Shaohao said: The ability to bear pain and the inability to bear pain are due to the thinness or thickness of the skin and the firmness or flexibility of the muscles, rather than a matter of courage.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u52c7\u602f\u4e4b\u6240\u7531\u7136\u3002\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u52c7\u58eb\u8005\uff0c\u76ee\u6df1\u4ee5\u56fa\uff0c\u9577\u6c96\u76f4\u63da\uff0c\u4e09\u7126\u7406\u6a6b\uff0c\u5176\u5fc3\u7aef\u76f4\uff0c\u5176\u809d\u5927\u4ee5\u5805\uff0c\u5176\u81bd\u6eff\u4ee5\u508d\uff0c\u6012\u5247\u6c23\u76db\u800c\u80f8\u5f35\uff0c\u809d\u8209\u800c\u81bd\u6a6b\uff0c\u7725\u88c2\u800c\u76ee\u63da\uff0c\u6bdb\u8d77\u800c\u9762\u84bc\uff0c\u6b64\u52c7\u58eb\u4e4b\u7531\u7136\u8005\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about what makes the courageous.

Shao Yong said: Timidity refers to one's gaze being large and not reducing, yin and yang not harmonizing, deficient in the orifices' regulation. Although the liver is connected to the gallbladder, the gallbladder does not fill up, the intestines are tense, the lower abdomen is empty, even though the anger is great, the qi cannot fill their chests. The liver and lungs may lift, but the qi declines again, which is why they cannot sustain their anger.

Shao Yong said: Alcohol is the essence of grains, the liquid of ripe grains. When its energy acts wildly, it enters the stomach. The stomach becomes bloated, the energy rises upward, filling the chest. The liver and gallbladder become distended, and at that time it is comparable to warriors. When the energy declines, there will be regret.

If you press them all at the place where they are tethered to the spine, about three inches away, and you want to test them, then press the location, and it should hurt and resolve in the middle, which indicates an outflow. Acupuncture is possible, but moxibustion is not. If there is fullness, use moxibustion; if there is emptiness, use supplementation.

Its Qi is internally stored in the five organs, while its tendons and joints are externally connected. The floating Qi that does not follow the channels serves as defense Qi; the circulating Qi within the channels serves as nourishing Qi. Yin and Yang follow each other, and the internal and external influence each other, like a circle without end. Pure and unblemished, who could dare to steal it? However, dividing Yin and Yang has its basis for true and false, which can distinguish between health and disease.

Since the qi is in the head, stop it at the brain; when the qi is in the chest, stop it at the diaphragm and back muscles; when the qi is in the abdomen, stop it at the diaphragm and connect with the great vessel at the left and right lower abdominal dynamic vessels; when the qi is at the hip, stop it on the qi street and connect with the gathering mountain on the soles of the feet. To treat this condition, use a needle and first press with the probe, and if it lasts for a long time, it will be effective in the hand. Those to be treated are headaches and dizziness, abdominal pain and fullness, and swelling and hardness. Pain that can move is easily cured; swelling without pain is difficult to cure.</p>"},{"location":"134_huangdi-neijing_lun-tong_zh_translated/","title":"\u8ad6\u75db","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u4e8e\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u7b4b\u9aa8\u4e4b\u5f37\u5f31\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u4e4b\u5805\u8106\uff0c\u76ae\u819a\u4e4b\u539a\u8584\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u4e4b\u758f\u5bc6\uff0c\u5404\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u4e8e\u937c\u77f3\u706b\u712b\u4e4b\u75db\u4f55\u5982\uff1f\u8178\u80c3\u4e4b\u539a\u8584\u5805\u8106\u4ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\uff0c\u5176\u65bc\u6bd2\u85e5\u4f55\u5982\uff1f\u9858\u76e1\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e4b\u9aa8\u5f37\u3001\u7b4b\u5f31\u3001\u8089\u7de9\u3001\u76ae\u819a\u539a\u8005\uff0c\u8010\u75db\uff0c\u5176\u4e8e\u937c\u77f3\u4e4b\u75db\u706b\u712b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked Shao Yong: The strength and weakness of tendons and bones, the firmness and brittleness of muscles, the thickness and thinness of skin, the sparseness and density of sinews - each is different.

In minor cases, puncture only when there are specific signs. Along with the signs of the constitution, do not dare to injure at the moment of abundance; if puncturing after decline, one can achieve great success. Thus, he said, At the time of abundance, do not dare to damage, and puncture after decline, and it will surely be a great achievement. Duke of Zhou added, In major cases, treating before the onset of disease, and not treating after the onset of disease, this is what I mean.</p>"},{"location":"137_huangdi-neijing_wu-wei_zh_translated/","title":"\u4e94\u5473","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u7a40\u6c23\u6709\u4e94\u5473\uff0c\u5176\u5165\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u5206\u5225\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u4f2f\u9ad8\u66f0\uff1a\u80c3\u8005\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u6d77\u4e5f\uff0c\u6c34\u7a40\u7686\u5165\u4e8e\u80c3\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u7686\u7a1f\u6c23\u65bc\u80c3\u3002\u4e94\u5473\u5404\u8d70\u5176\u6240\u559c\uff0c\u7a40\u5473\u9178\uff0c\u5148\u8d70\u809d\uff0c\u7a40\u5473\u82e6\uff0c\u5148\u8d70\u5fc3\uff0c\u7a40\u5473\u7518\uff0c\u5148\u8d70\u813e\uff0c\u7a40\u5473\u8f9b\uff0c\u5148\u8d70\u80ba\uff0c\u7a40\u5473\u54b8\uff0c\u5148\u8d70\u814e\u3002\u7a40\u6c23\u6d25\u6db2\u5df2\u884c\uff0c\u71df\u885b\u5927\u901a\uff0c\u4e43\u5316\u7cdf\u7c95\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b21\u50b3\u4e0b\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the five flavors of grain energy and how they enter the five organs and are distributed.

If one falls or collapses, the evil blood does not go away, and one suddenly becomes angry and frustrated, eats inappropriately, does not adjust to hot or cold temperatures, and the channels close up without circulation. Once they open and encounter cold winds, the blood and qi congeal and clash with the old pathogens, which results in cold paralysis.

Nowadays, we treat diseases by administering toxic medicines internally and using needles and stones externally, with some patients recovering while others do not, why is that? The Duke of Zhou replied: In ancient times, people lived like animals, moving to avoid cold and staying indoors to avoid heat. They had no accumulation of desires within them and no external pressure from officials, which was a time of humility and simplicity. Therefore, diseases could not penetrate deeply, so toxic medicines could not treat internally, and needles and stones could not treat externally. Nowadays, however, illnesses are caused by internal factors and damage the external body, as well as disregarding the proper seasonal treatments of cold and heat. Diseases from malevolent pathogens attack constantly, reaching deep into the five vital organs and bone marrow, as well as damaging the pores, muscles, and skin.

I wish to observe a diseased person, watch life and death, judge suspicion, and want to know the essence, like the light of the sun and moon, can it be heard? Zhi B\u00f3 said: The color and pulse are what the ancient sages greatly valued, and they were transmitted down through generations. In ancient times, they understood the color and pulse, combined them with gold, wood, water, and fire of the four seasons and eight winds, not deviating from their nature, changing and moving with transformation, observing its subtleties to know its essence, wanting to know its essence, then the color and pulse are it. The color changes in response to the day, and the pulse changes in response to the moon, constantly seeking its essence, and thus its essence appears. The change of color is in response to the four seasons' pulse, which is what the ancients greatly valued and combined with the spiritual light. This is why they can avoid death and approach life. The way of treating diseases in the middle period was to treat them at their root, after ten days of Tang fluid to eliminate eight winds and five pains of diseases, not stopping for ten days, and then treating them with twigs of grass and weeds, root and branch as assistants, the basis has been established, and the pathogenic qi will be swallowed. In later times, the treatment of diseases is different, not treating at the root of the four seasons, not knowing the sun and moon, not discerning between following and leading, when the disease shape has already formed, they want to treat superficially with needles, and treat internally with Tang fluid, rough workmanship and crudeness, regarding it as possible attack, so the disease is not yet cured, new diseases arise.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u8981\u9053\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u8981\u6975\uff0c\u7121\u5931\u8272\u8108\uff0c\u7528\u4e4b\u4e0d\u60d1\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u5927\u5247\u3002\u9006\u5f9e\u5230\u884c\uff0c\u6a19\u672c\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u4ea1\u795e\u5931\u570b\u3002\u53bb\u6545\u5c31\u65b0\uff0c\u4e43\u5f97\u771f\u4eba\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u5176\u8981\u65bc\u592b\u5b50\u77e3\uff0c\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u4e0d\u96e2\u8272\u8108\uff0c\u6b64\u4f59\u4e4b\u6240\u77e5\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u6975\u65bc\u4e00\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u4e00\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e00\u8005\uff0c\u56e0\u5f97\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u9589\u6236\u585e\u7256\uff0c\u7e6b\u4e4b\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u6578\u554f\u5176\u60c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f9e\u5176\u610f\uff0c\u5f97\u795e\u8005\u660c\uff0c\u5931\u795e\u8005\u4ea1\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 The emperor said, I wish to hear about the Dao. Boyi replied, Governing it is supreme, without failure of the vital energy, its use does not lead astray, and in governing great matters, one must be reverent. Follow and apply it thoroughly, establish models that cannot be lost, or else the spirit will wander and the country will perish. By abandoning the old and adopting the new, one can attain true humanity. The emperor said, I have heard of its essence from Master Zhou, and Master Zhou does not depart from the vital energy; this is what I know. Boyi replied, Governing it supremely lies in one.

If yin and yang do not communicate, the two heat struggle against each other, leading to a thickening. Can a small knife remove it? Duke of Zhou said: A sage cannot cause this transformation, and it is wrong. Therefore, the two armies face each other, flags face each other, sharp blades are arrayed in the middle ground; this is not a one-day plan. To make the people follow this, to prohibit soldiers from having no sharp blades; this is not a one-day teaching but a moment's achievement. When the body is afflicted with boils and carbuncles, how far from the right way? The generation of boils and carbuncles is the accumulation of turbid blood, not from under heaven or from the earth, and it arises from the subtle.

When paralysis is not moving and the muscles are breaking down, the person is hot, and the pulse is deviated, this represents the third reversal. When one indulges and loses their shape, the person is hot, the color turns pale and white, and then there is bleeding from below, and the bleeding is heavy, representing the four reversals.

This is how Stomach Qi moves independently of Yang Ming. Thus, Yin and Yang's up-down movement is harmonious. Therefore, when there are Yang symptoms and the Yang channel is small, it is called counterflow. When there are Yin symptoms and the Yin channel is enlarged, it is also called counterflow.

However, today there has been an unexpected encounter with evil winds and encounters great cold, and the hands and feet become sluggish. The flow of the yin and yang in the pulse has become confused, and the Qi cannot return to its course. Master Gao said: The convergence of the four extremities of yin and yang is the main pathway for Qi. The four channels are the paths of Qi. Therefore, if there is blockage, the paths will be open; if the four extremities are resolved, then the Qi will flow in harmony and be like a circular orbit. Yellow Emperor said: Good.

Shao Yong replied, Sour enters the stomach, its qi becomes turbid and collects, rising upward to the two fu organs, unable to enter or exit. If it does not exit, it remains in the stomach, which has a balanced environment, causing water to flow downward to the bladder. The bladder's essence is weak, so if there is sour, it contracts and tightens, binds and does not communicate, disrupting the waterway, thus causing pain. Yin refers to the endpoint of filling the sinews, so sour enters and walks the sinews.</p> <p>2: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9e79\u8d70\u8840\uff0c\u591a\u98df\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u6e34\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\uff1f\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u9e79\u5165\u4e8e\u80c3\uff1b\u5176\u6c23\u4e0a\u8d70\u4e2d\u7126\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8108\uff0c\u5247\u8840\u6c23\u8d70\u4e4b\uff0c\u8840\u8207\u9e79\u76f8\u5f97\uff0c\u5247\u51dd\uff0c\u51dd\u5247\u80c3\u4e2d\u6c41\u6ce8\u4e4b\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e4b\u5247\u80c3\u4e2d\u7aed\uff0c\u7aed\u5247\u54bd\u8def\u7126\uff0c\u6545\u820c\u672c\u5e72\u800c\u5584\u6e34\u3002\u8840\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u4e2d\u7126\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u9e79\u5165\u800c\u8d70\u8840\u77e3\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Why does salty taste cause thirst? Shao Yong said: Salt enters the stomach. Its Qi rises and acts on the spleen, causing the blood and Qi to circulate. When blood and salt meet, they coagulate, and when they coagulate, the fluids in the stomach are exhausted. When they are exhausted, the throat pathway becomes parched, thus the tongue is inherently dry and good at being thirsty. The blood vessels are the channel of the spleen, so salt enters and acts on the blood.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8f9b\u8d70\u6c23\uff0c\u591a\u98df\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u6d1e\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\uff1f\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u8f9b\u5165\u4e8e\u80c3\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u8d70\u65bc\u4e0a\u7126\uff0c\u4e0a\u7126\u8005\uff0c\u53d7\u6c23\u800c\u71df\u8af8\u967d\u8005\u4e5f\uff0c\u8591\u97ed\u4e4b\u6c23\u718f\u4e4b\uff0c\u71df\u885b\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u4e0d\u6642\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e45\u7559\u5fc3\u4e0b\uff0c\u6545\u6d1e\u5fc3\u3002\u8f9b\u8207\u6c23\u4ff1\u884c\uff0c\u6545\u8f9b\u5165\u800c\u8207\u6c57\u4ff1\u51fa\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: What is the reason that cinnamon promotes the flow of Qi, and when people eat more of it, their hearts become clear? Shao Yong replied: Cinnamon enters the spleen, its Qi moves upwards to the middle energy center. The middle energy center is where the Qi is received and nourishes the yang, and ginger and scallion's Qi fumigate it. By timely replenishing the defensive Qi, it stays in the heart area for a long time, thus making hearts clear. When cinnamon and Qi both move, cinnamon enters and goes out with sweating.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u82e6\u8d70\u9aa8\uff0c\u591a\u98df\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u8b8a\u5614\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\uff1f\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u82e6\u5165\u4e8e\u80c3\uff0c\u4e94\u7a40\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u7686\u4e0d\u80fd\u52dd\u82e6\uff0c\u82e6\u5165\u4e0b\u8118\uff0c\u4e09\u7126\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u7686\u9589\u800c\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u6545\u8b8a\u5614\u3002\u9f52\u8005\uff0c\u9aa8\u4e4b\u6240\u7d42\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u82e6\u5165\u800c\u8d70\u9aa8\uff0c\u6545\u5165\u800c\u5fa9\u51fa\uff0c\u77e5\u5176\u8d70\u9aa8\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: What is the reason for the bitter walking of the bones and causing people to vomit after eating too much? Shao Yong said: Bitter enters the stomach, the Qi of five grains cannot overcome the bitterness. Bitterness enters the lower chest, the passageways of the three Yang organs are all closed and do not communicate, therefore causing vomiting. In response to this, I say that the teeth are the end of the bones, so when bitterness walks and spreads, it enters and then exits, knowing it is walking the bones.</p> <p>5: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7518\u8d70\u8089\uff0c\u591a\u98df\u4e4b\u3002\u4ee4\u4eba\u6097\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\uff1f\u5c11\u4fde\u66f0\uff1a\u7518\u5165\u4e8e\u80c3\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u5f31\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0a\u81f3\u65bc\u4e0a\u7126\uff0c\u800c\u8207\u8c37\u7559\u65bc\u80c3\u4e2d\u8005\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u67d4\u6f64\u8005\u4e5f\uff0c\u80c3\u67d4\u5247\u7de9\uff0c\u7de9\u5247\u87f2\u52d5\uff0c\u87f2\u52d5\u5247\u4ee4\u4eba\u6097\u5fc3\u3002\u5176\u6c23\u5916\u901a\u65bc\u8089\uff0c\u6545\u7518\u8d70\u8089\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Eat more ginseng. Why would it make people's heart palpitate? Shao Yong said: Ginseng enters the stomach and its energy is weak and slight, unable to rise up to the upper abdomen. It stays in the stomach with grains, making people feel softened and relaxed. If the stomach is softened, it calms things down, and when things are calm, insects will move, causing people's heart palpitations. Its energy circulates outside in meat, so ginseng can make one's flesh ache</p>"},{"location":"145_huangdi-neijing_yin-yang-er-shi-wu-ren_zh_translated/","title":"\u9670\u967d\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u4eba","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u4eba\u4f55\u5982\uff1f\u4f2f\u9ad8\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u516d\u5408\u4e4b\u5167\uff0c\u4e0d\u96e2\u65bc\u4e94\uff0c\u4eba\u4ea6\u61c9\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u4e94\u4e94\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u4eba\u4e4b\u653f\uff0c\u800c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u4eba\u4e0d\u8207\u7109\u3002\u5176\u614b\u53c8\u4e0d\u5408\u65bc\u773e\u8005\u4e94\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\u9858\u805e\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u4eba\u4e4b\u5f62\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u5225\u800c\u4ee5\u5019\uff0c\u5f9e\u5916\u77e5\u5167\uff0c\u4f55\u5982\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b64\u5148\u5e2b\u4e4b\u79d8\u4e5f\uff0c\u96d6\u4f2f\u9ad8\u7336\u4e0d\u80fd\u660e\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u907f\u5e2d\u9075\u5faa\u800c\u537b\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e4b\u5f97\u5176\u4eba\u5f17\u6559\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u91cd\u5931\uff0c\u5f97\u800c\u6cc4\u4e4b\uff0c\u5929\u5c07\u53ad\u4e4b\uff0c\u4f59\u9858\u5f97\u800c\u660e\u4e4b\uff0c\u91d1\u6ac3\u85cf\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u6562\u63da\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5148\u7acb\u4e94\u5f62\u91d1\u6728\u6c34\u706b\u571f\uff0c\u5225\u5176\u4e94\u8272\uff0c\u7570\u5176\u4e94\u5f62\u4e4b\u4eba\uff0c\u800c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u4eba\u5177\u77e3\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u614e\u4e4b\u614e\u4e4b\uff0c\u81e3\u8acb\u8a00\u4e4b\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: What of those skilled in Yin and Yang?

Thus, among the Twenty-Five Hegemons, there are those skilled in Yin and Yang who are not part of it; their conduct does not conform to that of the Five. I already know this.

How about that? Boyi replied: The form is superior to the complexion, and the complexion is superior to the form at its peak time. When years add on, one feels ill and suffers from diseases. If they are both obtained, great happiness and honor result. Yellow Emperor asked: At the time when the form and complexion are both superior, can one know when the years add on? Boyi replied: Anyone who is above seventy years old, the major taboo is to add seven years every ten years, sixteen years, twenty-five years, thirty-four years, forty-three years, fifty-two years, and sixty-one years. These are major taboos that one must not neglect oneself, feel ill and suffer from diseases.

How does this pertain to the formation and appearance of hair? Boyang replied: Abundant blood and qi in the foot Jueyin channel lead to long and luxuriant eyebrows, while deficient blood and abundant qi cause short eyebrows. Hence, if qi is deficient and blood is abundant, the eyebrows will be sparse; if both are deficient, there will be no eyebrows. The upper lips are filled with lines, and in the foot Jueyin channel below, abundant blood and qi lead to long and luxuriant pubic hair that reaches the chest, while an excess of blood and deficient qi results in short pubic hair that is close to the genitals, leading to good gait and high-stepping feet. The soles of the feet have less flesh, which makes them suitable for cold climates. A deficiency of blood and abundance of qi will result in fleshy growths and suitability for sweating. If both are deficient, there may be hair but it will be sparse and dry, leading to weakness, numbness of the feet, and a tendency towards paralysis.</p> <p>9: \u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u6c23\u8840\u76db\u5247\u901a\u9aef\u7f8e\u9577\uff0c\u8840\u591a\u6c23\u5c11\u5247\u901a\u9aef\u7f8e\u77ed\uff0c\u8840\u5c11\u6c23\u591a\u5247\u5c11\u9aef\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u7686\u5c11\u5247\u7121\u9b1a\uff0c\u611f\u65bc\u5bd2\u6fd5\u5247\u5584\u75fa\u3002\u9aa8\u75db\u722a\u67af\u4e5f\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u76db\u5247\u811b\u6bdb\u7f8e\u9577\uff0c\u5916\u8e1d\u80a5\uff1b\u8840\u591a\u6c23\u5c11\u5247\u811b\u6bdb\u7f8e\u77ed\uff0c\u5916\u8e1d\u76ae\u5805\u800c\u539a\uff0c\u8840\u5c11\u6c23\u591a\u5247\u80fb\u6bdb\u5c11\uff0c\u5916\u8e1d\u76ae\u8584\u800c\u8edf\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u7686\u5c11\u5247\u7121\u6bdb\uff0c\u5916\u8e1d\u7626\u7121\u8089\u3002 Above the foot yang channel, when qi and blood are abundant, the beard is long and beautiful, and the mustache is long.

By examining their forms and determining if there is an excess or deficiency, one can discern if they are favorable or unfavorable.</p> <p>15: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u5176\u8af8\u9670\u967d\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6309\u5176\u5bf8\u53e3\u4eba\u8fce\uff0c\u4ee5\u8abf\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5207\u5faa\u5176\u7d93\u7d61\u4e4b\u51dd\u6f80\uff0c\u7d50\u800c\u4e0d\u901a\u8005\uff0c\u6b64\u65bc\u8eab\u7686\u70ba\u75db\u75fa\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u6545\u51dd\u6f80\uff0c\u51dd\u6f80\u8005\uff0c\u81f4\u6c23\u4ee5\u6eab\u4e4b\u8840\u548c\u4e43\u6b62\u3002\u5176\u7d50\u7d61\u8005\uff0c\u8108\u7d50\u8840\u4e0d\u548c\uff0c\u6c7a\u4e4b\u4e43\u884c\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u65bc\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u5c0e\u800c\u4e0b\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\u65bc\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u63a8\u800c\u4f11\u4e4b\uff0c\u5176\u7a3d\u7559\u4e0d\u81f3\u8005\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u8fce\u4e4b\uff0c\u5fc5\u660e\u65bc\u7d93\u96a7\uff0c\u4e43\u80fd\u6301\u4e4b\uff0c\u5bd2\u8207\u71b1\u722d\u8005\uff0c\u5c0e\u800c\u884c\u4e4b\uff0c\u5176\u5b9b\u9673\u8840\u4e0d\u7d50\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u800c\u4e88\u4e4b\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u660e\u77e5\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u4eba\u5247\u8840\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u523a\u7d04\u7562\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: How to pierce the Jueyin?

For those who are tied, there is excess Qi above, guide it downwards; if the Qi is insufficient above, push it gently; when they hesitate and do not reach the appropriate point, approach it; you must master the path of the channels, so as to be able to hold them. When cold and heat contend, guide them along the path; for those who have no knotted blood, give them medicine; you must first understand the location of the blood and Qi in the twenty-five men, left right upper and lower, pierce and complete.</p>"},{"location":"146_huangdi-neijing_wu-yin-wu-wei_zh_translated/","title":"\u4e94\u97f3\u4e94\u5473","text":"<p>1: \u53f3\u5fb5\u8207\u5c11\u5fb5\uff0c\u8abf\u53f3\u624b\u592a\u967d\u4e0a\u3002\u5de6\u5546\u8207\u5de6\u5fb5\uff0c\u8abf\u5de6\u624b\u967d\u660e\u4e0a\u3002\u5c11\u5fb5\u8207\u5927\u5bae\uff0c\u8abf\u5de6\u624b\u967d\u660e\u4e0a\u3002\u53f3\u89d2\u8207\u5927\u89d2\uff0c\u8abf\u53f3\u624b\u5c11\u967d\u4e0b\u3002\u5927\u5fb5\u8207\u5c11\u5fb5\uff0c\u8abf\u5de6\u624b\u592a\u967d\u4e0a\u3002\u773e\u7fbd\u8207\u5c11\u7fbd\uff0c\u8abf\u53f3\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u4e0b\u3002\u5c11\u5546\u8207\u53f3\u5546\u8abf\u53f3\u624b\u592a\u967d\u4e0b\u3002\u684e\u7fbd\u8207\u773e\u7fbd\uff0c\u8abf\u53f3\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u4e0b\u3002\u5c11\u5bae\u8207\u5927\u5bae\uff0c\u8abf\u53f3\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u4e0b\u3002\u5224\u89d2\u8207\u5c11\u89d2\uff0c\u8abf\u53f3\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u4e0b\u3002\u91f1\u5546\u8207\u4e0a\u5546\uff0c\u8abf\u53f3\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u4e0b\u3002\u91f1\u5546\u8207\u4e0a\u89d2\uff0c\u8abf\u5de6\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u4e0b\u3002 Right Wrist and Little Wrist, regulate the Right Hand Yuan-source.

If joy and anger are not regulated, they will harm the interior; if there is an attack of wind and rain, it harms the exterior; if there is an attack of cold and dampness, it harms the lower part. I want to know how the three departments of Qi are affected differently, and how they may arise from Yin or Yang. Master Qi Bo replied: The three departments of Qi have different manifestations depending on whether they originate from Yin or Yang. If joy and anger are not regulated, it harms the interior, thus giving rise to diseases in the Yin; if there is an attack by cold and dampness, it targets the lower part, thus giving rise to diseases below; if there is an attack by wind and rain, it targets the upper part, thus giving rise to diseases above.

Qi Bo said: Wind and rain, cold and heat cannot harm [the body] when it is empty (without defensive Qi). Those who encounter sudden fever, windstorm, and heavy rain but do not fall ill are because they are empty, so the pathogenic factor cannot harm them. This must be due to the relationship between the defensive and pathogenic Qi and their bodily form. When one's body is robustly healthy, the pathogenic factor will have no place to attach. The disease arises from the interaction of defensive and pathogenic Qi at a particular time in accordance with one's bodily form.

When the skin is loose, the hair-pores open up, and when they open up, the evil enters through the hairs. Once it has entered deeply, the hairs stand on end, which causes a state of bewilderment. Hence, there is pain in the skin. If one does not remove it, it passes into the sinews, at the time of the sinews there is pain in the muscles, thus at the time of the muscles one sighs, and the Great Classic speaks metaphorically. If one does not remove it, it passes into the channels, at the time of the channels there is dizziness, joy, and shock. If one does not remove it, it passes into the network vessels, at the time of the network vessels, the six channels do not connect to the limbs, causing joint pain, the loins and back become strong. If one does not remove it, it passes into the buried tendons' vessels, at the time of the buried tendons' vessels, the body feels heavy and aches in the entire body, if one does not remove it, it passes into the intestines and stomach, at the time of the intestines and stomach, there is distension in the abdomen. If there is cold, then the intestines make gurgling sounds and leak, digestion is impaired. If there is heat, then there is discharge of pus. If one does not remove it, it passes into the outside of the intestines and the original region, lodging in the vessels, accumulating further and sometimes attaching to the branch vessel, sometimes to the network vessel, sometimes to the channel vessel, sometimes to the drainage vessel, sometimes to the buried tendons' vessel, sometimes to the sinews and muscles, sometimes to the intestines and stomach's original region, ascending to the relaxed tendons, evil qi flows wantonly and cannot be described in detail.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u76e1\u805e\u5176\u6240\u7531\u7136\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u8457\u5b6b\u7d61\u4e4b\u8108\u800c\u6210\u7a4d\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u7a4d\u5f80\u4f86\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u81c2\u5c0f\u5b6b\u7d61\u4e4b\u5c45\u4e5f\uff0c\u6d6e\u800c\u7de9\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u53e5\u7a4d\u800c\u6b62\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u5f80\u4f86\u79fb\u884c\u8178\u80c3\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u6c34\u6e4a\u6ef2\u6ce8\u704c\uff0c\u6fef\u6fef\u6709\u97f3\uff0c\u6709\u5bd2\u5247\u441c\u441c\u6eff\u96f7\u5f15\uff0c\u6545\u6642\u5207\u75db\uff0c\u5176\u8457\u65bc\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u7d93\u5247\u633e\u81cd\u800c\u5c45\uff0c\u98fd\u98df\u5247\u76ca\u5927\uff0c\u98e2\u5247\u76ca\u5c0f\u3002\u5176\u8457\u65bc\u7de9\u7b4b\u4e5f\uff0c\u4f3c\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u7a4d\uff0c\u98fd\u98df\u5247\u75db\uff0c\u98e2\u5247\u5b89\u3002\u5176\u8457\u65bc\u8178\u80c3\u4e4b\u52df\u539f\u4e5f\uff0c\u75db\u800c\u5916\u9023\u65bc\u7de9\u7b4b\uff0c\u98fd\u98df\u5247\u5b89\uff0c\u98e2\u5247\u75db\u3002\u5176\u8457\u65bc\u4f0f\u6c96\u4e4b\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u63e3\u4e4b\u61c9\u624b\u800c\u52d5\uff0c\u767c\u624b\u5247\u71b1\u6c23\u4e0b\u65bc\u5169\u80a1\uff0c\u5982\u6e6f\u6c83\u4e4b\u72c0\u3002\u5176\u8457\u65bc\u8182\u7b4b\uff0c\u5728\u8178\u5f8c\u8005\u98e2\u5247\u7a4d\u898b\uff0c\u98fd\u5247\u7a4d\u4e0d\u898b\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5f97\u3002\u5176\u8457\u65bc\u8f38\u4e4b\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u9589\u585e\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u6d25\u6db2\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b54\u7ac5\u5e72\u58c5\uff0c\u6b64\u90aa\u6c23\u4e4b\u5f9e\u5916\u5165\u5167\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear its origin clearly. Guan Pu said: It is due to the accumulation of Sun SiMiao's channels, which come and go up and down. The Small Intestine channel is related to Sun SiMiao, floating and slow, unable to stop the accumulation, so it comes and goes, moving between the stomach and intestines, regulating water, and generating sound and cold, causing pain when full. When it reaches the Yang Ming Meridian, it lodges in the connective tissue, and when one is overfed, it increases, while when hungry, it decreases. It lodges in the Shen Jin (tendons) and seems similar to the Yang Ming accumulation. When overfed, it causes pain, and when hungry, it becomes comfortable. It lodges in the source of the intestines and connects with the tendons outside, causing discomfort when hungry and pain when full. It lodges in the Fuai Meridian's channel, where it can be felt as a lump when hungry and not seen when full, and pressing on it is painful. It lodges in the vessel (Yin Wei) channel, where it can be felt by pressing the hand and moving the hand generates heat that goes down to the knees, like boiling water. It lodges in the Jue Yin Meridian, where pressing it causes discomfort at the back of the muscles of the intestines when hungry and not seen when full, and pressing on it is painful. It lodges in the Xuan Yin channel, which is blocked and does not circulate, leading to a buildup of body fluids, stuffiness in the orifices, and this is external pathogenic qi invading internally from outside and from above and below.</p> <p>5: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7a4d\u4e4b\u59cb\u751f\uff0c\u81f3\u5176\u5df2\u6210\uff0c\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7a4d\u4e4b\u59cb\u751f\uff0c\u5f97\u5bd2\u4e43\u751f\uff0c\u53a5\u4e43\u6210\u7a4d\u4e5f\uff0c\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6210\u7a4d\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53a5\u6c23\u751f\u8db3\u6097\uff0c\u6097\u751f\u811b\u5bd2\uff0c\u811b\u5bd2\u5247\u8840\u8108\u51dd\u6f80\uff0c\u8840\u8108\u51dd\u6f80\u5247\u5bd2\u6c23\u4e0a\u5165\u4e8e\u8178\u80c3\uff0c\u5165\u4e8e\u8178\u80c3\u5247\u441c\u8139\uff0c\u441c\u8139\u5247\u8178\u5916\u4e4b\u6c41\u6cab\u8feb\u805a\u4e0d\u5f97\u6563\uff0c\u65e5\u4ee5\u6210\u7a4d\u3002\u5352\u7136\u591a\u98df\u98f2\uff0c\u5247\u8178\u6eff\uff0c\u8d77\u5c45\u4e0d\u7bc0\uff0c\u7528\u529b\u904e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5247\u7d61\u8108\u50b7\uff0c\u967d\u7d61\u50b7\u5247\u8840\u5916\u6ea2\uff0c\u8840\u5916\u6ea2\u5247\u8844\u8840\uff0c\u9670\u7d61\u50b7\u5247\u8840\u5167\u6ea2\uff0c\u8840\u5167\u6ea2\u5247\u5f8c\u8840\u3002\u8178\u80c3\u4e4b\u7d61\u50b7\u5247\u8840\u6ea2\u65bc\u8178\u5916\uff0c\u8178\u5916\u6709\u5bd2\uff0c\u6c41\u6cab\u8207\u8840\u76f8\u640f\uff0c\u5247\u4f75\u5408\u51dd\u805a\u4e0d\u5f97\u6563\uff0c\u800c\u7a4d\u6210\u77e3\u3002\u5352\u7136\u4e2d\u5916\u65bc\u5bd2\uff0c\u82e5\u5167\u50b7\u65bc\u6182\u6012\uff0c\u5247\u6c23\u4e0a\u9006\uff0c\u6c23\u4e0a\u9006\u5247\u516d\u4fde\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u6eab\u6c23\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u51dd\u8840\u860a\u88cf\u800c\u4e0d\u6563\uff0c\u6d25\u6db2\u6f80\u6ef2\uff0c\u8457\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u800c\u7a4d\u7686\u6210\u77e3\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: What do you mean by accumulating something that is just beginning to form, and what happens when it has been completed? Qi Bo replied: When something is just beginning to form and accumulates, it requires cold to be generated, and it reaches completion through yin. Yellow Emperor asked: And how does it become complete? Qi Bo replied: When the qi becomes abundant, the kidney qi generates cold, which causes the blood vessels to congeal and thicken. Congealed and thickened blood vessels cause cold qi to ascend into the stomach and intestines, leading to nausea and bloating. Nausea and bloating cause digestive fluids to clump together and not be able to disperse, eventually resulting in accumulation. If one eats and drinks excessively, the stomach becomes full, leading to irregular posture and overstraining of the tendons and vessels, causing injury to the yang vessels, which results in bleeding externally. Injury to the yin vessels causes bleeding internally, leading to dark blood. Injury to the stomach and intestines' vessels causes bleeding outside of the stomach, where cold exists, and digestive fluids clash with blood, causing them to coagulate and not disperse, eventually resulting in accumulation. In cases of excess internal and external cold, if one injures oneself internally due to worry and anger, qi will rise reversely, leading to the six channels becoming blocked, with stagnant qi not circulating, clotting blood within the vessels and not dispersing, causing fluids to become thick and sticky, leading to accumulation.</p> <p>6: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u751f\u65bc\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6182\u601d\u50b7\u5fc3\uff0c\u91cd\u5bd2\u50b7\u80ba\uff0c\u5fff\u6012\u50b7\u809d\uff0c\u9189\u4ee5\u5165\u623f\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\u7576\u98a8\u50b7\u813e\uff0c\u7528\u529b\u904e\u5ea6\uff0c\u82e5\u5165\u623f\u6c57\u51fa\u6d1b\uff0c\u5247\u50b7\u814e\uff0c\u6b64\u5167\u5916\u4e09\u90e8\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\u75c5\u8005\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: What about the one born of Yin?

Duke Huan replied: It is due to the lack of divine will. The emperor asked: What do you mean by lack of divine will? Duke Huan replied: It is the path of needling stones (referring to acupuncture). When the spirit and mind are not cultivated, intentions are not controlled, resulting in illness that cannot be cured. Now, with depletion and loss of spirit, the honored officials cannot be reinstated.

Good doctors all know the method, keep track of the number, and relatives and friends, whether far or near, hear about it through word of mouth, and see the five colors with their eyes every day. If the disease does not heal, what time would there be to not act early? Hui Bo said: Disease is the root, and diagnosis is the standard; if the standard cannot be established from the root, then the pathogenic qi will not dissipate, which is what is meant by this.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6709\u4e0d\u5f9e\u6beb\u6bdb\u800c\u751f\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u967d\u4ee5\u7aed\u4e5f\uff0c\u6d25\u6db2\u5145\u90ed\uff0c\u5176\u9b44\u7368\u5c45\uff0c\u5b64\u7cbe\u65bc\u5167\uff0c\u6c23\u8017\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u5f62\u4e0d\u53ef\u8207\u8863\u76f8\u4fdd\uff0c\u6b64\u56db\u6975\u6025\u800c\u52d5\u4e2d\uff0c\u662f\u6c23\u62d2\u65bc\u5167\uff0c\u800c\u5f62\u65bd\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5e73\u6cbb\u65bc\u6b0a\u8861\uff0c\u53bb\u5b9b\u9673\u839d\uff0c\u5fae\u52d5\u56db\u6975\uff0c\u6eab\u8863\uff0c\u7e46\u523a\u5176\u8655\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fa9\u5176\u5f62\u3002\u958b\u9b3c\u9580\uff0c\u6f54\u6de8\u5e9c\uff0c\u7cbe\u4ee5\u6642\u670d\uff0c\u4e94\u967d\u5df2\u5e03\uff0c\u8e08\u6ecc\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u6545\u7cbe\u81ea\u751f\uff0c\u5f62\u81ea\u76db\uff0c\u9aa8\u8089\u76f8\u4fdd\uff0c\u5de8\u6c23\u4e43\u5e73\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Emperor said: What does not arise from a single hair follicle can be brought about by the essence of the five organs and the Yang.

The Duke of Zhou replied: Regulate the balance between Yin and Yang, eliminate the deviation of Zhou, make subtle movements for the four extremes, warm the clothes, puncture the acupoints, thereby restoring its shape. Open the Ghost Gate, purify the Palace, refine the essence at the appropriate time, when the five Yangs have been established, tread and massage the five organs, thus the spirit will spontaneously emerge, the form will naturally be ample, the flesh and bones will be preserved, and the immense Qi will be pacified.

What kind of energy is moving? Causes speech to be weak? I wish to hear its method. The Master of Lesser Learning answered, saying: The throat is the pathway for water and grain. The larynx is where the energy goes up and down. The uvula is the door for sound. The lips are the fan for sound. The tongue is the mechanism for sound. The hanging (epiglottis) and hanging (arytenoid cartilage) are the locks for sound. The cheeks are where the energy leaks out. The mandible is what the spirit-energy uses to control the projection of the tongue. Therefore, if a person's nasolacrimal duct does not retract and their uvula does not open, the energy is not balanced. This is why a person who suddenly feels cold and has no speech will not be able to emit energy or emit it easily. If a person suddenly feels hot and has no speech, they will have difficulty emitting and transmitting energy, causing their speech to be slurred. </p> <p>2: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8db3\u4e4b\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u4e0a\u4fc2\u65bc\u820c\uff0c\u7d61\u65bc\u6a6b\u9aa8\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u6703\u53ad\u3002\u5169\u5beb\u5176\u8840\u8108\uff0c\u6fc1\u6c23\u4e43\u907f\u3002\u6703\u53ad\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u4e0a\u7d61\u4efb\u8108\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u5929\u7a81\uff0c\u5176\u53ad\u4e43\u767c\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: How should it be treated?

What kind of qi brings this about? Confucius replied, Five grains enter the stomach, their dregs and fluids nourish the vital qi, dividing into three channels. Therefore, the vital qi accumulates in the chest and issues forth from the throat, permeating the heart vessels and guiding respiration. The managed qi causes the fluids to flow through the vessels, transforming them into blood, irrigating the four extremities and nourishing the five organs and six palaces, responding to changes in numbers. The regulated qi emerges from the sharp qi's urgency and precedes in the gaps between the flesh, skin, and pores of the four extremities, unceasingly. During the day it acts in the Yang, at night in the Yin, always traversing the five organs and six palaces through the dividing channel of the little yin of the foot, today the qi of the five organs and six palaces is deficient, so the defensive qi guards its exterior, acting in the Yang and not entering the Yin. Acting in the Yang causes the Yang to be abundant, and the Yang being abundant causes the Yang Bridge to collapse, not entering the Yin, the Yin is empty, thus causing one not to sleep.</p> <p>2: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6cbb\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u4f2f\u9ad8\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u5176\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5beb\u5176\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u8abf\u5176\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u4ee5\u901a\u5176\u9053\uff0c\u800c\u53bb\u5176\u90aa\u3002\u98f2\u4ee5\u534a\u590f\u6e6f\u4e00\u5291\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u5df2\u901a\uff0c\u5176\u81e5\u7acb\u81f3\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6b64\u6240\u8b02\u6c7a\u7006\u58c5\u585e\uff0c\u7d93\u7d61\u5927\u901a\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u548c\u5f97\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u9858\u805e\u5176\u65b9\u3002\u4f2f\u9ad8\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6e6f\u65b9\u4ee5\u6d41\u6c34\u5343\u91cc\u4ee5\u5916\u8005\u516b\u5347\uff0c\u63da\u4e4b\u842c\u904d\uff0c\u53d6\u5176\u6e05\u4e94\u5347\uff0c\u716e\u4e4b\uff0c\u708a\u4ee5\u8466\u85aa\u706b\uff0c\u6cb8\u7f6e\u79eb\u7c73\u4e00\u5347\uff0c\u6cbb\u534a\u590f\u4e94\u5408\uff0c\u5f90\u708a\uff0c\u4ee4\u7aed\u70ba\u4e00\u5347\u534a\uff0c\u53bb\u5176\u6ed3\uff0c\u98f2\u6c41\u4e00\u5c0f\u676f\uff0c\u65e5\u4e09\u7a0d\u76ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u70ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u6545\u5176\u75c5\u65b0\u767c\u8005\uff0c\u5fa9\u676f\u5247\u81e5\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\u5247\u5df2\u77e3\u3002\u4e45\u8005\uff0c\u4e09\u98f2\u800c\u5df2\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Good. How should I treat it? Duke of Gao said: Supplement its deficiencies, rectify its excesses, regulate its reality, and harmonize its virtues to guide its course, while eliminating its deviations. Drink a dose of Xiajiao soup, and the yin and yang will be connected, returning to normal sitting and standing postures. Yellow Emperor said: Good. This is what is called resolving stagnation and unblocking obstructions, regulating the meridians, harmonizing yin and yang, and achieving a balanced state. I hope to hear its method. Duke of Gao said: The soup formula consists of 8 ounces of water from a river over a thousand li away, boiled a hundred times, taking five ounces of the clear liquid, boiling it, steaming it with reeds and willows, adding one cup of millet rice, simmering half an Xiajiao, cooking until it becomes one and a half cups, removing excess liquid, drinking the broth in small sips, gradually increasing by three cups per day to determine the appropriate dosage. In the early stages of illness, if you drink again, the patient will return to bed, and if sweating occurs, recovery is achieved.

If evil does dwell therein, then the heart will be injured; if the heart is injured, then the spirit will depart, and with the spirit's departure comes death. Thus, all evils lie within the heart's domain, which are under the mastery of the heart channel's connecting vessel.

Hua Tuo said: When the exterior has passed through illness and concealed without sickness, one focuses on taking its course at the sharp end of the styloid process of the radius. The rest of the pulse exits and enters, bends and stretches, all as if reflecting the pulse of the heart governor. Therefore, those who originally have no Yin, all do so because their Qi is rapid or slow to obtain it, thus seeking harmony when weakened and supplementing when declining; this is known as following the natural order. When pathogenic Qi departs and true Qi becomes firm, this is known as following the order of Heaven.</p> <p>8: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6301\u937c\u7e31\u820d\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5fc5\u5148\u660e\u77e5\u5341\u4e8c\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u672c\u672b\uff0c\u76ae\u819a\u4e4b\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u8108\u4e4b\u76db\u8870\u6ed1\u6f80\u3002\u5176\u8108\u6ed1\u800c\u76db\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u65e5\u9032\uff1b\u865b\u800c\u7d30\u8005\uff0c\u4e45\u4ee5\u6301\uff1b\u5927\u4ee5\u6f80\u8005\uff0c\u70ba\u75db\u75fa\u3002\u9670\u967d\u5982\u4e00\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u96e3\u6cbb\u3002\u5176\u672c\u672b\u5c1a\u71b1\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u5c1a\u5728\uff1b\u5176\u71b1\u4ee5\u8870\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u4ea6\u53bb\u77e3\u3002\u6301\u5176\u5c3a\uff0c\u5bdf\u5176\u8089\u4e4b\u5805\u8106\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u6ed1\u6f80\uff0c\u5bd2\u6eab\u71e5\u6fd5\u3002\u56e0\u8996\u76ee\u4e4b\u4e94\u8272\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u800c\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\u3002\u8996\u5176\u8840\u8108\uff0c\u5bdf\u5176\u8272\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u5176\u5bd2\u71b1\u75db\u75fa\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Holding a lancet, what should one do? Duke of Shou replied: One must first clearly understand the origins and ends of the twelve meridians, as well as the skin's cold and heat, and the fullness and weakness of the pulse. If the pulse is slippery and strong, the illness will progress; if it is empty and thin, one should persist; if it is large and turbid, it will cause pain and numbness. If yin and yang are equal, treating the disease will be difficult. If the origins and ends of the meridians are still hot, the illness has not yet resolved; if the heat dissipates along with the weakness, then the illness is gone as well. Holding the zhang, examine the flesh's firmness and suppleness, large or small, slippery or turbid, cold or warm. Examine the five colors of the eyes to know the five organs and determine life and death. Look at the blood and pulse, examine their colors, to know whether it is cold, hot, painful, or numb.</p> <p>9: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6301\u937c\u7e31\u820d\uff0c\u9918\u672a\u5f97\u5176\u610f\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6301\u937c\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u6b32\u7aef\u4ee5\u6b63\uff0c\u5b89\u4ee5\u975c\u3002\u5148\u77e5\u865b\u5be6\u800c\u884c\u75be\u5f90\u3002\u5de6\u624b\u57f7\u9aa8\uff0c\u53f3\u624b\u5faa\u4e4b\u3002\u7121\u8207\u8089\u679c\u3002\u5beb\u6b32\u7aef\u4ee5\u6b63\uff0c\u88dc\u5fc5\u9589\u819a\u3002\u8f14\u937c\u5c0e\u6c23\uff0c\u90aa\u5f97\u6deb\u6cc6\uff0c\u771f\u6c23\u5f97\u5c45\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Holding the lancet, one can pierce and let go; it is not yet at its purpose.

How does one attend to them? Huang Di answered: Attend to the five organs. Yellow Emperor asked: What is attending like? Huang Di said: If there is pathogenic factor in the lungs and heart, the qi will accumulate at the elbows; if there is pathogenic factor in the liver, the qi will flow to the shoulders; if there is pathogenic factor in the spleen, the qi will accumulate at the hips; if there is pathogenic factor in the kidneys, the qi will accumulate at the ankles. All eight emptinesses are related to the channels and collaterals, along which true qi flows and blood vessels circulate. Pathogenic qi and bad blood must not remain. If they stay, it will damage the muscles and bones; the channels cannot bend or stretch freely, so there is rigidity and pain.</p>"},{"location":"153_huangdi-neijing_tong-tian_zh_translated/","title":"\u901a\u5929","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u65bc\u5c11\u5e2b\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u5617\u805e\u4eba\u6709\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u9670\u4eba\uff1f\u4f55\u8b02\u967d\u4eba\uff1f\u5c11\u5e2b\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u516d\u5408\u4e4b\u5167\uff0c\u4e0d\u96e2\u65bc\u4e94\uff0c\u4eba\u4ea6\u61c9\u4e4b\uff0c\u975e\u5f92\u4e00\u9670\u4e00\u967d\u800c\u5df2\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u7565\u8a00\u8033\uff0c\u53e3\u5f17\u80fd\u904d\u660e\u4e5f\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u7565\u805e\u5176\u610f\uff0c\u6709\u8ce2\u4eba\u8056\u4eba\uff0c\u5fc3\u80fd\u5099\u800c\u884c\u4e4b\u4e4e\uff1f\u5c11\u5e2b\u66f0\uff1a\u84cb\u6709\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u4eba\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u4eba\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u4eba\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u4eba\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u548c\u5e73\u4e4b\u4eba\u3002\u51e1\u4e94\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u614b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u7b4b\u9aa8\u6c23\u8840\u5404\u4e0d\u7b49\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked the Master, I have heard that there are Yin and Yang in people.

Talking about yin and yang, they correspond with the Five Phases, the Five Viscera and Six Bowels also have their places, the four seasons and eight winds also have yin and yang. Each gets its proper position in the Bright Hall, each area of color corresponds to the Five Viscera and Six Bowels. By examining where it hurts, left and right, up and down, one knows its cold or warmth, which meridian it is in according to the Acupuncture and Moxibustion Canon. First determine its course, then thin and scatter it slightly, gradually deepening it so that one can enter slowly. Great Heat is above, push it down; from top to bottom, guide it away; when there is pain in front, take it first. Great Cold is outside, retain it and supplement it; when it enters the center, write from the union. Acupuncture should not be used without Moxibustion, and moxibustion should be applied where acupuncture is appropriate. If the Qi is not sufficient above, push and raise it; if the Qi is not sufficient below, accumulate and send it from below. When yin and yang are both deficient, fire will arise of itself. Extreme cold in the channels, bones sink downwards, cold exceeding the knees, knees sink downwards three li. The channel passes through, stop and hold it there, cold enters within, push and move it; at the place where the channel sinks down, fire will act upon it; knotted and tightened ligaments, fire is what treats them. Not knowing where it hurts, both legs bend downwards, male and female, skillful practitioners must restrain themselves in their discussion of Acupuncture.</p> <p>4: \u7528\u937c\u4e4b\u670d\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u6cd5\u5247\uff0c\u4e0a\u8996\u5929\u5149\uff0c\u4e0b\u53f8\u516b\u6b63\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f9f\u5947\u90aa\uff0c\u800c\u89c0\u767e\u59d3\uff0c\u5be9\u65bc\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u7121\u72af\u5176\u90aa\u3002\u662f\u5f97\u5929\u4e4b\u9748\uff0c\u9047\u6b72\u4e4b\u865b\uff0c\u6551\u800c\u4e0d\u52dd\uff0c\u53cd\u53d7\u5176\u6b83\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5fc5\u77e5\u5929\u5fcc\uff0c\u4e43\u8a00\u937c\u610f\u3002 Using acupuncture, there is a method; it relies on the celestial order and governs the Eight Constellations.

Writing must use assistants, cut and turn them, and the qi will move quickly and come out smoothly. When treating evil qi, extend and meet them at a distance, open their orifices so that the qi can come out quickly. To supplement, one must use proper methods. Externally draw their skin, position themselves at the door of their passageways, left pull their joints, and right push their skin, turning it gently and pushing it slowly until it is upright, calm and firm. The will to be subtle is there to preserve it. Let qi descend quickly and come out forcefully, push their skin, seal their outer door, true qi will remain. The essence of acupuncture is not to forget the spirit.</p> <p>8: \u96f7\u516c\u554f\u65bc\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u937c\u8ad6\u66f0\uff1a\u5f97\u5176\u4eba\u4e43\u50b3\uff0c\u975e\u5176\u4eba\u52ff\u8a00\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u77e5\u5176\u53ef\u50b3\uff1f\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5404\u5f97\u5176\u4eba\uff0c\u4efb\u4e4b\u5176\u80fd\uff0c\u6545\u80fd\u660e\u5176\u4e8b\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5b98\u80fd\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u660e\u76ee\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u8996\u8272\uff1b\u8070\u8033\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u807d\u97f3\uff1b\u6377\u75be\u8fad\u8a9e\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u50b3\u8ad6\uff1b\u8a9e\u5f90\u800c\u5b89\u975c\uff0c\u624b\u5de7\u800c\u5fc3\u5be9\u8ae6\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u884c\u937c\u827e\uff0c\u7406\u8840\u6c23\u800c\u8abf\u8af8\u9006\u9806\uff0c\u5bdf\u9670\u967d\u800c\u517c\u8af8\u65b9\u3002\u7de9\u7bc0\u67d4\u7b4b\u800c\u5fc3\u548c\u8abf\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u5c0e\u5f15\u884c\u6c23\uff1b\u75be\u6bd2\u8a00\u8a9e\u8f15\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u553e\u7670\u546a\u75c5\uff1b\u722a\u82e6\u624b\u6bd2\uff0c\u70ba\u4e8b\u5584\u50b7\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u6309\u7a4d\u6291\u75fa\u3002\u5404\u5f97\u5176\u80fd\uff0c\u65b9\u4e43\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5176\u540d\u4e43\u5f70\u3002\u4e0d\u5f97\u5176\u4eba\uff0c\u5176\u529f\u4e0d\u6210\uff0c\u5176\u5e2b\u7121\u540d\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5f97\u5176\u4eba\u4e43\u8a00\uff0c\u975e\u5176\u4eba\u52ff\u50b3\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u624b\u6bd2\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u8a66\u6309\u9f9c\uff0c\u7f6e\u9f9c\u65bc\u5668\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u6309\u5176\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e94\u5341\u65e5\u800c\u6b7b\u77e3\uff0c\u624b\u7518\u8005\uff0c\u5fa9\u751f\u5982\u6545\u4e5f\u3002 Lei Gong asked Yellow Emperor, The Longevity Needle Classic says that if you obtain a person's gift, it will be passed on, and not speaking of it is not an issue; how do you know it can be passed on? Yellow Emperor replied, Each obtains their person's gift and lets them develop their skills, so they are able to succeed in their tasks. Lei Gong said, I would like to hear about the officials who excel at this? Yellow Emperor said, Those who see clearly can use seeing colors; those who are clever can hear sounds; those who are skilled at speaking and writing quickly can transmit theories; those who speak slowly and maintain peacefulness, have nimble hands and careful minds can practice acupuncture and moxibustion, regulate blood and qi, and differentiate yin and yang while understanding all aspects. Those who are calm, gentle, soft, and harmonious in heart and temperament can guide the circulation of qi; those who speak harshly and lightly injure people can curse diseases; those with bitter hands and poisonous palms, skilled at causing harm for their work, can press and suppress blockages. Each one develops their skills, and only then can they succeed, and their names will be distinguished. Not obtaining someone's gift, their achievements will not be completed, and their teachers will remain unknown. Hence, obtaining someone's gift is speaking; not passing it on is not an issue, this is what I mean. The master who can test the needles can place the turtle shell on a container, press its top, and after 50 days, the turtle will die, but if the shell is unyielding, it will revive as before.</p>"},{"location":"155_huangdi-neijing_lun-ji-zhen-chi_zh_translated/","title":"\u8ad6\u75be\u8a3a\u5c3a","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u4e8e\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u6b32\u7121\u8996\u8272\u6301\u8108\uff0c\u7368\u8abf\u5176\u5c3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a00\u5176\u75c5\uff0c\u5f9e\u5916\u77e5\u5167\uff0c\u70ba\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5be9\u5176\u5c3a\u4e4b\u7de9\u6025\u5c0f\u5927\u6ed1\u6f80\uff0c\u8089\u4e4b\u5805\u8106\uff0c\u800c\u75c5\u5f62\u5b9a\u77e3\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked Guan Pu: I want to examine the pulse without regarding color and observe it with the divining rod, in order to discern the disease and know internal from external, what should I do?

The flesh is weak, a combination of heat and cold, and one who undresses while feeling heat or cold cannot be cured. Smooth skin with oiliness indicates the presence of wind.

The person has an excessive and slippery pulse when the skin is hot. When it is cold and the pulse is small, this suggests a discharge of heat or deficiency of qi. Skin that glows fiercely, then cools down suggests that it is due to an alternating condition of heat and cold.

When asked about Zhen Xuan, it is still more urgent than Zhen Xuan. Yellow Emperor said: Good. How should one take it? Qi Bo replied: Take it from Tian Contong. Yellow Emperor asked: For those who have difficulty coughing and gasping for breath, how should they take it? Qi Bo replied: Take it from Plain Well. Yellow Emperor said: Is there a limit to this?

Yellow Emperor said: Good. What do you mean by hearing sounds in the ears? Hui Shi said: Needling falsely with a firm hand, pressing both nostrils closed, will quickly extract the sound, which must be applied with the needle. Yellow Emperor said: Good.

Zigong, there are three factors that contribute to this disorder, he explained. The first is a weak connection between your vertebrae in the lumbar region; the second is an unstable knee joint; and the third is the malfunction of the reproductive organs, which affect the movement of body fluids. Therefore, if you do not pay attention to your diet, or are hasty in expressing anger, the fluid will overflow into your extremities, causing blockage of the blood vessels, enlargement of the liver, difficulty bending over and standing straight, and impairment of movement. This disorder is known as 'disease of the deformed fingers.'

There is no fixed location for them. I wish to hear more about this. Qi Bo: The Yang Qi is excessive, while the Yin Qi is insufficient. If the Yin Qi is insufficient, there will be internal heat. If the Yang Qi is excessive, there will be external heat. When internal heat battles with external heat, the heat invades the pivot point, and externally one fears approaching cotton or silk materials too closely; it cannot be close to the body nor close to the seat. The marrow reasoning becomes blocked, so sweat does not come out, the tongue is parched and the lips are cracked, the limbs become dry and further heat accumulates.

Below there is an incremental wash, above grows reeds and sedges, which is why we know the amount of form and qi. Yin and yang are cold and heat, warmth promotes growth and is located above, with fewer juices in roots and stems, the human being's qi is outside, the skin is supple, and the marrow opens, blood and qi decrease, sweating is excessive, skin is clammy. Cold causes the earth to freeze water into ice, the human being's qi is inside, the skin becomes tough, the marrow closes, sweating does not come out, blood and qi are strong, meat is hardened. At that time, those skilled in swimming cannot go to the ice, those skilled in walking cannot step on frozen ground, and those skilled in using needles cannot take the four extremities, blood vessels become congealed and rigid, and qi does not circulate freely. Therefore, those who walk on water must wait for the weather to warm up, for the ice to melt and thaw, so that water can flow and ground can be walked on. The human being is similar in this regard. To treat extremities, one must first regulate and harmonize their channels, holding at the wrist and elbow, at the ankle and knee, at the neck and spine, to harmonize them. Once fire qi has passed through, blood vessels will circulate. Then, depending on the illness, look at the pulse: clammy and flowing, one should use needles to disperse; tight and rigid, one should pierce and scatter, qi descending will settle, this is called resolving knots.</p> <p>15: \u7528\u937c\u4e4b\u985e\uff0c\u5728\u65bc\u8abf\u6c23\uff0c\u6c23\u7a4d\u65bc\u80c3\uff0c\u4ee5\u901a\u71df\u885b\uff0c\u5404\u884c\u5176\u9053\u3002\u5b97\u6c23\u7559\u65bc\u6d77\uff0c\u5176\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6c23\u8857\uff0c\u5176\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u8d70\u65bc\u606f\u9053\u3002\u6545\u53a5\u5728\u65bc\u8db3\uff0c\u5b97\u6c23\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u8108\u4e2d\u4e4b\u8840\uff0c\u51dd\u800c\u7559\u6b62\uff0c\u5f17\u4e4b\u706b\u8abf\uff0c\u5f17\u80fd\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002 Using lancets of this type, regulate the qi, accumulate it in the stomach, and circulate it through the Wei channels to let each follow its own course.

The manifestations are countless; what is the reason for this? The Duke of Zhou replied: All of these are due to pathogenic Qi. Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that Qi has true Qi, righteous Qi, and pathogenic Qi. What is true Qi? The Duke of Zhou replied: True Qi is what one receives from Heaven and blends with the grain Qi, nourishing the body. Righteous Qi is the correct breath that comes from one direction. It is not real or virtual wind; rather it is an energy that can be harmonized and leaves on its own accord. The energy in pathogenic Qi is a malicious harm to people, deeply rooted within them, and cannot leave by itself. Righteous Qi's energy is shallowly rooted within people, and when it is harmonized, it leaves on its own accord; its Qi is gentle and weak, unable to overcome true Qi, so it leaves.</p> <p>20: \u865b\u90aa\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u6d12\u6670\u52d5\u5f62\uff0c\u8d77\u6beb\u6bdb\u800c\u767c\u8160\u7406\u3002\u5176\u5165\u6df1\uff0c\u5167\u640f\u65bc\u9aa8\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u9aa8\u75fa\uff1b\u640f\u65bc\u7b4b\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u7b4b\u6523\uff1b\u640f\u65bc\u8108\u4e2d\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u8840\u9589\uff0c\u4e0d\u901a\u5247\u70ba\u7670\u3002\u640f\u65bc\u8089\uff0c\u8207\u885b\u6c23\u76f8\u640f\uff0c\u967d\u52dd\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u71b1\uff0c\u9670\u52dd\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u5bd2\u3002\u5bd2\u5247\u771f\u6c23\u53bb\uff0c\u53bb\u5247\u865b\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u5bd2\u640f\u65bc\u76ae\u819a\u4e4b\u9593\u3002\u5176\u6c23\u5916\u767c\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u958b\uff0c\u6beb\u6bdb\u6416\uff0c\u6c23\u5f80\u4f86\u884c\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u75d2\u3002\u7559\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u5247\u75fa\u3002\u885b\u6c23\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u4e0d\u4ec1\u3002 A person with vacuity and evil in the interior has clear, distinct movements and hairs standing on end. If it goes deep into the bones, it is bone pain; if into the muscles, it is muscle tension; if into the blood vessels, it is blocked blood, and if not passing through, it becomes a swelling. Struggling with the flesh, it interferes with the defensive Qi, and if yang prevails, it results in heat, while if yin prevails, it results in cold. Cold causes true Qi to depart, which leads to vacuity, and vacuity allows cold to struggle between the skin and flesh. Its energy is manifested externally, with the hair standing on end, the pulse opening, and the Qi going back and forth, resulting in itching. If left untreated, it becomes pain.

This condition starts shallowly affecting the body, particularly around the waist area, and as it progresses deeper, it impacts the honor guards (an internal organ system), which leads to the decline of genuine Qi and the presence of pathogenic Qi alone. In the latter stage, this results in a partial withering or imbalance of energy flow.

Guan Pu replied, There are twelve months in a year and twelve zodiac signs. The terms sui and xia form the meridians, and chen and wu form the equator. The sky is divided into twenty-eight lunar mansions, with one face of seven stars and forty-seven other stars. Kangcheng forms the meridian, and xuan zhang forms the terms. Therefore, when yang arrives at bai, it is yin at xin. Yang governs daytime, and yin governs nighttime. Thus, the movement of guardian qi in one day and one night spans fifty cycles. During the daytime, it travels twenty-five cycles along the yang meridian, and twenty-five cycles along the yin meridian during the nighttime.

Two steps equal three units within the body and six units away. Three steps equal five units within the body and four units away. Four steps equal seven units within the body and two units away. Five steps equal nine units within the body, and six steps equal ten units within the body and eight units away. Seven steps equal twelve units within the body and six units away. Fourteen steps equal twenty-five units within the body with a rare division and two units away, yin is complete in yang, and yin receives qi. It starts from yin and proceeds from the foot's yin minor yard to the kidney, the kidney to the heart, the heart to the lung, the lung to the liver, and the liver to the spleen, returning to the kidney to complete a cycle. Therefore, in nighttime, one step equals one unit of qi within the hidden storehouse and eight units away from the hidden storehouse, which is like twenty-five units of yang. They are united at the eyes. Yin and yang occur once day and once night, uniting with a rare division of ten units and two units away. Therefore, when people wake up or lie down, there are early and late times, and this is because the rare division is not complete.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u885b\u6c23\u4e4b\u5728\u65bc\u8eab\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5f80\u4f86\u4e0d\u4ee5\u671f\uff0c\u5019\u6c23\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u4f2f\u9ad8\u66f0\uff1a\u5206\u6709\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u65e5\u6709\u9577\u77ed\uff0c\u6625\u79cb\u51ac\u590f\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u5206\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u5e38\u4ee5\u5e73\u65e6\u70ba\u7d00\uff0c\u4ee5\u591c\u76e1\u70ba\u59cb\u3002\u662f\u6545\u4e00\u65e5\u4e00\u591c\uff0c\u6c34\u4e0b\u767e\u523b\uff0c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u523b\u8005\uff0c\u534a\u65e5\u4e4b\u5ea6\u4e5f\uff0c\u5e38\u5982\u662f\u6bcb\u5df2\uff0c\u65e5\u5165\u800c\u6b62\uff0c\u96a8\u65e5\u4e4b\u9577\u77ed\uff0c\u5404\u4ee5\u70ba\u7d00\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u8b39\u5019\u5176\u6642\uff0c\u75c5\u53ef\u8207\u671f\uff0c\u5931\u6642\u53cd\u5019\u8005\uff0c\u767e\u75c5\u4e0d\u6cbb\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u5be6\u8005\uff0c\u523a\u5176\u4f86\u4e5f\uff0c\u523a\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u523a\u5176\u53bb\u4e5f\u3002\u6b64\u8a00\u6c23\u5b58\u4ea1\u4e4b\u6642\uff0c\u4ee5\u5019\u865b\u5be6\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u662f\u6545\u8b39\u5019\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u5728\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u9022\u6642\u3002\u5728\u65bc\u4e09\u967d\uff0c\u5fc5\u5019\u5176\u6c23\u5728\u65bc\u967d\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u65bc\u4e09\u9670\uff0c\u5fc5\u5019\u5176\u6c23\u5728\u9670\u5206\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Qi resides in the body and comes and goes without restriction, waiting for the qi before needling. How should one proceed? Master Gao said: There are variations in terms of how much and how long. The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter all have their own classifications. Therefore, one should always use the equinoxes as a reference, using the solstices as starting points. This is why one day equals one night, with 100 intervals in water, and 25 intervals being half a day. One should proceed accordingly without stopping, adjusting according to the length of the day, and using these as references for needling. Be careful and follow the timing precisely; illness can be anticipated by this method. If one misses the time or misjudges it, one hundred diseases cannot be cured. Thus, when needling in reality, one needs to needle according to the arrival of qi or its departure. This is discussing the time for treating life and death through waiting for the presence or absence of qi while needling. One must carefully wait for the location of qi and then needle accordingly, which means acting in accordance with the moment. One should needles at the Yang Meridian by awaiting the arrival of qi at Yang and needle it; if there is illness at the Yin Meridian, one should await the arrival of qi at Yin before needling.</p> <p>5: \u6c34\u4e0b\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e8c\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u5c11\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e09\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u967d\u660e\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u56db\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u9670\u5206\u3002\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e94\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u5c11\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e03\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u967d\u660e\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u516b\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u9670\u5206\u3002\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e5d\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u5c11\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u967d\u660e\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u9670\u5206\u3002\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u4e09\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u56db\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u5c11\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u4e94\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u967d\u660e\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u9670\u5206\u3002\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u4e03\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u516b\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u5c11\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u5341\u4e5d\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u967d\u660e\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e8c\u5341\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u9670\u5206\u3002\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u5c11\u967d\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u967d\u660e\uff1b\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u9670\u5206\u3002\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u523b\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u6b64\u534a\u65e5\u4e4b\u5ea6\u4e5f\u3002\u5f9e\u623f\u81f3\u7562\u4e00\u5341\u56db\u820d\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e94\u5341\u523b\uff0c\u65e5\u884c\u534a\u5ea6\uff0c\u56de\u884c\u4e00\u820d\uff0c\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e09\u523b\u8207\u4e03\u5206\u523b\u4e4b\u56db\u3002\u5927\u8981\u66f0\uff1a\u5e38\u4ee5\u65e5\u4e4b\u52a0\u65bc\u5bbf\u4e0a\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u662f\u6545\u65e5\u884c\u4e00\u820d\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u884c\u4e09\u967d\u884c\u8207\u9670\u5206\uff0c\u5e38\u5982\u662f\u7121\u5df2\uff0c\u5929\u8207\u5730\u540c\u7d00\uff0c\u7d1b\u7d1b\u7d1b\u7d1b\uff0c\u7d42\u800c\u5fa9\u59cb\uff0c\u4e00\u65e5\u4e00\u591c\u6c34\u4e0b\u767e\u523b\u800c\u76e1\u77e3\u3002 At any given moment underwater, the Qi is at the Taiyi.

If it comes beforehand, there will be much rain; if it comes afterward, there will be much sweat. The Great One changes on the day of the winter solstice and is consulted for the ruler; the Great One changes on the day of the spring equinox and is consulted for the minister; the Great One changes on the day of the middle palace and is consulted for the official; the Great One changes on the day of the autumn equinox and is consulted for the general; the Great One changes on the day of the summer solstice and is consulted for the common people. What is called a change refers to the days when the Great One dwells in the five palaces, causing illness, withering trees, raising sand and stones, each according to what they govern. By observing the direction from which the wind comes, one can determine whether it is real or virtual wind. If it comes from where it resides, it is a true wind, nurturing life and growing countless things; if it comes from its rear, it is a virtual wind that harms people, governing killing and harm. Being cautious of the virtual wind and avoiding it, the sage person avoids the evil path, like avoiding arrows in flight, so that evil cannot hurt, and this is what they mean by it.</p> <p>4: \u662f\u6545\u592a\u4e00\u5165\u5f99\u7acb\u65bc\u4e2d\u5bae\uff0c\u4e43\u671d\u516b\u98a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5360\u5409\u51f6\u4e5f\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u5357\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5927\u5f31\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u65bc\u8108\uff0c\u6c23\u4e3b\u71b1\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u897f\u5357\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u8b00\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u65bc\u808c\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e3b\u70ba\u5f31\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u897f\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u525b\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u65bc\u76ae\u819a\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e3b\u70ba\u71e5\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u897f\u5317\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u6298\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u5c0f\u8178\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u65bc\u624b\u592a\u967d\u8108\uff0c\u8108\u7d55\u5247\u6ea2\uff0c\u8108\u9589\u5247\u7d50\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5584\u66b4\u6b7b\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u5317\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5927\u525b\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u65bc\u9aa8\u8207\u80a9\u80cc\u4e4b\u8182\u7b4b\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e3b\u70ba\u5bd2\u4e5f\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u6771\u5317\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u51f6\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u5927\u8178\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u65bc\u5169\u8105\u814b\u9aa8\u4e0b\u53ca\u80a2\u7bc0\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u6771\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5b30\u5140\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u65bc\u7b4b\u7d10\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e3b\u70ba\u8eab\u6fd5\u3002\u98a8\u5f9e\u6771\u5357\u65b9\u4f86\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5f31\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5167\u820d\u65bc\u80c3\uff0c\u5916\u5728\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e3b\u9ad4\u91cd\u3002\u6b64\u516b\u98a8\u7686\u5f9e\u5176\u865b\u4e4b\u9109\u4f86\uff0c\u4e43\u80fd\u75c5\u4eba\u3002\u4e09\u865b\u76f8\u640f\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u66b4\u75c5\u5352\u6b7b\u3002\u5169\u5be6\u4e00\u865b\uff0c\u75c5\u5247\u70ba\u6dcb\u9732\u5bd2\u71b1\u3002\u72af\u5176\u5169\u6fd5\u4e4b\u5730\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u75ff\u3002\u6545\u8056\u4eba\u907f\u98a8\uff0c\u5982\u907f\u77e2\u77f3\u7109\u3002\u5176\u6709\u4e09\u865b\u800c\u504f\u4e2d\u65bc\u90aa\u98a8\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u4ec6\u504f\u67af\u77e3\u3002 Therefore, the Great Ultimate enters and stands in the Middle Palace, representing the Eight Trigrams and used for divination of auspiciousness. The wind coming from the south is called the Great Yin Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the heart and externally in the pulse, governing heat. The wind coming from the southwest is called the Willow Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the spleen and externally in the muscles, governing weakness. The wind coming from the west is called the Rigid Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the lungs and externally in the skin, governing dryness. The wind coming from the northwest is called the Twisting Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the small intestine and externally in the hand yang channel, with the pulse blocked it causes drowning, and with the pulse closed it causes blockage and obstruction leading to a sudden death. The wind coming from the north is called the Great Rigid Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the kidneys and externally in the bones and shoulder blade tendons, governing coldness. The wind coming from the northeast is called the Disaster Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the large intestine and externally at the lower part of the pectoral girdle joints and limb joints. The wind coming from the east is called the Newborn Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the liver and externally in the tendons, governing bodily moisture. The wind coming from the southeast is called the Weak Wind, which harms people, dwelling internally in the stomach and externally in the muscles, governing corporeality. These Eight Winds all come from their deficiency regions and can harm people. When the three deficiencies struggle, it results in a violent fatal illness. When there are two realities and one deficiency, the person becomes ill with sweating and fever. If they offend the two moist areas, it leads to paralysis. Therefore, the sage avoids the wind as if avoiding arrows or rocks. If there are three deficiencies focusing on the evil wind, then the limbs become withered.</p>"},{"location":"159_huangdi-neijing_jiu-zhen-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u4e5d\u937c\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e5d\u937c\u65bc\u592b\u5b50\uff0c\u773e\u591a\u535a\u5927\u77e3\uff0c\u4f59\u7336\u4e0d\u80fd\u5be4\uff0c\u6562\u554f\u4e5d\u937c\u7109\u751f\uff0c\u4f55\u56e0\u800c\u6709\u540d\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e5d\u937c\u8005\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u5927\u6578\u4e5f\uff0c\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u800c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e5d\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u4e00\u4ee5\u6cd5\u5929\uff0c\u4e8c\u4ee5\u6cd5\u5730\uff0c\u4e09\u4ee5\u6cd5\u4eba\uff0c\u56db\u4ee5\u6cd5\u6642\uff0c\u4e94\u4ee5\u6cd5\u97f3\uff0c\u516d\u4ee5\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e03\u4ee5\u6cd5\u661f\uff0c\u516b\u4ee5\u6cd5\u98a8\uff0c\u4e5d\u4ee5\u6cd5\u91ce\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that there are nine needles from Confucius, and they are numerous and profound.

Needles should be fine and sharp like a needle, and should target the affected areas precisely to remove the blocked energy.</p> <p>9: \u4e03\u8005\uff0c\u661f\u4e5f\u3002\u661f\u8005\uff0c\u4eba\u4e4b\u4e03\u7ac5\uff0c\u90aa\u4e4b\u6240\u5ba2\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u800c\u70ba\u75db\u75fa\uff0c\u5408\u65bc\u7d93\u7d61\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u70ba\u4e4b\u6cbb\u937c\uff0c\u4ee4\u5c16\u5982\u868a\u867b\u5599\uff0c\u975c\u4ee5\u5f90\u5f80\uff0c\u5fae\u4ee5\u4e45\u7559\uff0c\u6b63\u6c23\u56e0\u4e4b\uff0c\u771f\u90aa\u4ff1\u5f80\uff0c\u51fa\u937c\u800c\u990a\u8005\u4e5f\u3002 Seven [points] are stars. Stars refer to the seven orifices of humans, where evil resides according to the classics, and causes pain and paralysis, merging with the channels.

The wind is the eight channels of the knee and elbow. When the channels of the Eight Points are deficient, the wind harms people, causing deep pain in the muscles, tendons, and joints between the lumbar vertebrae.

Three, hook needle, patterned after the sharp end of millet or wheat, with a length of three and a half inches, used for pressing the pulse and exhaling evil, expelling it. Four, knife-edge needle, patterned after the thistle needle, cover its body and sharpen its tip, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used for treating heat rash and bleeding. Five, chisel needle, patterned after the knife, with a broad tip of two and a half divisions, with a length of four inches, used for treating large heat boils and abscesses, for yin and yang contending. Six, moxa-assisted needle, patterned after the cautery needle, refine its tip and reduce its body size, making it suitable for deep insertion, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used for treating heat rash stiffness and pain. Seven, hair follicle needle, patterned after the hair follicles, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used to treat cold, heat, pain, and numbness in tendons. Eight, long needle, patterned after the silk needle, with a length of seven inches, used for treating deep evil and distant stiffness and pain.

The left elbow corresponds to the Vernal Equinox (Water), on the day of Bingchen. The left hand corresponds to summer (Fire), on the day of Wudou and Gengzi. The breast, throat, and head correspond to the summer solstice (Earth), on the day of Renren. The right hand corresponds to autumn (Metal), in the middle of the month, on the day of Xinchou. The right elbow corresponds to the Autumn Equinox (Water), on the day of Jichou. The right foot corresponds to winter (Water), on the day of Wuxu and Jixu. The lower back corresponds to the winter solstice (Fire), on the day of Rishen. All six palaces and three storage areas correspond to the Central Plains, with the main capital being where the Grand Taboo is located on days governed by Yin and Yang. These nine positions are all places of good timing for the Eight Positives.

This is a constant principle and a measure of degrees. Pulse palpitations are weak and irregular, characterized by the interplay of cold and heat.

By practicing the principles of constancy and odd-even, one can begin with the Lesser Yin. Acting contrary to what is beneficial is referred to as reversal, which leads to death; acting in accordance with what is advantageous is called following, which ensures life.

Yu Qi replied: Evil qi resides in the lung palace, and the illness descends following a persistent fever. The guardian qi disperses day and night, constantly gathering at the lung palace, and when it reaches the next degree, the day is made stagnant. This indicates that the evil qi has first lodged in the lumbar region. Whenever it arrives at the lung palace, the network vessels open up, allowing evil qi to enter. As a result, the illness worsens, which explains why the day becomes more stagnant. The guardian qi moves within the lung palace, reaching the next degree after 21 days and entering the lumbar region on the 22nd day, merging with the Chong Mai, and its energy ascends for nine days, exiting from the Ren Mai. Thus, the illness worsens further. The energy then accumulates within the five organs, spreading horizontally across the source field, but its path is distant, its qi is deep, its movement is slow, and it cannot become stagnant on a daily basis.

The channels do not open, but there are those who contract illnesses; why does this happen? Minister of Health replied: Your Majesty does not know the evil entering [the body]. Even if one's channels maintain a balance between opening and closing, it can still occur at certain times. Yellow Emperor said: Is this understandable? Minister of Health said: Human beings correspond with heaven and earth, and respond to the sun and moon. Thus when the moon is full, sea water flows towards the west, causing human blood and Qi to accumulate, muscles to fill, skin to form, pores to appear, hair to strengthen, and vessels to close, dust and dirt adhere; this is a time when foreign pathogens do not easily penetrate deeply. When the lunar mansion empties, sea water flows towards the east, human Qi and blood are depleted, guardian Qi retreats, one's form stands alone, muscles weaken, skin wrinkles, channels open, hair becomes sparse, vessel strength diminishes, dust and dirt fall away; this is a time when foreign pathogens can easily penetrate deeply. In such cases, the illness becomes severe and could be fatal.</p> <p>6: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6709\u5352\u7136\u66b4\u6b7b\u66b4\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\uff1f\u5c11\u5e2b\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u6b7b\u66b4\u75be\u4e5f\uff1b\u5f97\u4e09\u5be6\u8005\u90aa\u4e0d\u80fd\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u4e09\u865b\u3002\u5c11\u5e2b\u66f0\uff1a\u4e58\u5e74\u4e4b\u8870\uff0c\u9022\u6708\u4e4b\u7a7a\uff0c\u5931\u6642\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u8cca\u98a8\u6240\u50b7\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u4e09\u865b\u3002\u6545\u8ad6\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e09\u865b\uff0c\u5de5\u53cd\u70ba\u9ea4\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u4e09\u5be6\u3002\u5c11\u5e2b\u66f0\uff1a\u9022\u5e74\u4e4b\u76db\uff0c\u9047\u6708\u4e4b\u6eff\uff0c\u5f97\u6642\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u96d6\u6709\u8cca\u98a8\u90aa\u6c23\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5371\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u4e4e\u54c9\u8ad6\uff01\u660e\u4e4e\u54c9\u9053\uff01\u8acb\u85cf\u4e4b\u91d1\u5331\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u4e09\u5be6\u3002\u7136\uff0c\u6b64\u4e00\u592b\u4e4b\u8ad6\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked, What about those who die suddenly or suffer from serious illness? What is the cause? The Master said, It is due to the three deficiencies. Those who die of sudden illness have all three deficiencies; those who are in possession of the three realities will not be harmed by evil qi. Yellow Emperor said, I would like to hear about the three deficiencies. The Master said, Riding the decline of one's years, encountering the empty moon, missing the harmony of time, and being injured by the thief wind, this is called the three deficiencies. Therefore, those who do not understand the three deficiencies cannot be skilled in their practice. Yellow Emperor said, I would like to hear about the three realities.

Younger Master said: This is a matter of the Eight Regularities. Yellow Emperor: What can be done about it? Younger Master: When this occurs, one must always wait until the winter solstice. The Great Ultimate will be established in the Palace of Insects on that day; Heaven will necessarily respond with wind and rain. Wind and rain coming from the south are empty winds that harm people. They arrive at midnight when all the myriad people are asleep and not harmed. When they arrive during the day, the myriad people are idle and all come into contact with empty winds, so the myriad people get sick. Empty evil enters the bones without manifesting externally and does not emerge until the beginning of spring, when yang qi is released in great quantity and the orifices open according to the day of the beginning of spring. Wind comes from the west at that time, and the myriad people again come into contact with empty winds; these two evils contend, causing the vital energy to accumulate and stagnate. Therefore, whenever one encounters wind and rain together, it is called an encounter with seasonal dew. Based on the harmony of the season, one can avoid evil winds. The people will have fewer diseases and fewer deaths.

On the winter solstice, on the morning of north wind, spring comes, and many people die. On the winter solstice, on the morning of north wind, walking, there are many sick people, one in three. In the winter solstice, at noon north wind, summer arrives, and many people die. In the winter solstice, at dusk north wind, autumn comes, and many people die. Throughout the day, north wind, six in ten will be dead. On the winter solstice, the wind comes from the south, called drought village; coming from the west, called white bones, the country is in peril, and many people die. On the winter solstice, the wind comes from the east, raises dust, sand, and stones, causing a great disaster for the country. On the winter solstice, the wind comes from the southeast, spring has deaths. On the winter solstice, the first day, heaven is warm without wind, and there are no diseases among the people; when cold and windy, it is stingy, and many people get sick. This is called waiting for the weather in a year and hurting people. In the second month, no wind, many people suffer from heart and abdomen diseases; in the third month, no heat, many people have cold and fever; in the fourth month, no heat, many people have scabies; in the tenth month, no cold, many people die violently. All so-called winds blow houses, break trees, raise sand, stones, raising every hair on their heads. 1.

I privately and secretly observed it, closed my eyes and gazed steadily, calmly and peacefully for a long time without understanding. I was alone, staring and looking at it for a long time that did not stop. Suddenly, I came down from above, what qi made this happen? Guan Yu answered: The essence of the five viscera and six bowels is all sent up to the eyes to nourish them. The nest of essence is the eyes, the essence of bones is the pupils, the essence of sinews is the black eyes, the essence of blood is the cords of the eyes, the essence of qi is the white eyes, the essence of muscle and tendons is the binding, and the essence of arteries wraps around the bones, blood, qi, and essence. The superior resides in the brain, and comes out from the neck. Therefore, pathogenic factors are present in the neck, and by encountering its own emptiness, it enters deeply, then the eyes become bound to enter the brain. Entering the brain causes the brain to turn, turning the brain leads to tightening the eye bindings. The eye bindings become dizzy and turn, resulting in dizziness. If the pathogenic factor's essence is not harmonious within itself, then the essence scatters. Scattered essence leads to double vision, and seeing two objects. The eyes are the essence of the five viscera and six bowels, the dwelling place of defending the soul and spirit, and the source of qi. Therefore, when the mind is exhausted, the soul and spirit scatter and intentions become chaotic. This is why black pupils and red pulse methods are used in yin and yang, so when yin and yang merge, there is clarity. The eyes are the heart's use. The heart is the palace of the spirit, so when the qi and essence are disordered, it does not turn, and that is why it is called being dizzy.</p> <p>2: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u7591\u5176\u7136\u3002\u4f59\u6bcf\u4e4b\u6771\u82d1\uff0c\u672a\u66fe\u4e0d\u60d1\uff0c\u53bb\u4e4b\u5247\u5fa9\uff0c\u4f59\u552f\u7368\u70ba\u6771\u82d1\u52de\u795e\u4e4e\uff1f\u4f55\u5176\u7570\u4e5f\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u7136\u4e5f\u3002\u5fc3\u6709\u6240\u559c\uff0c\u795e\u6709\u6240\u60e1\uff0c\u5352\u7136\u76f8\u60d1\uff0c\u5247\u7cbe\u6c23\u4e82\uff0c\u8996\u8aa4\uff0c\u6545\u60d1\uff0c\u795e\u79fb\u4e43\u5fa9\u3002\u662f\u6545\u9593\u8005\u70ba\u8ff7\uff0c\u751a\u8005\u70ba\u60d1\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I suspect it is so. I have always been puzzled by the Eastern Yard, not understanding it well; if I remove it, it returns; am I the only one who labors for the Eastern Yard? How strange that would be! Grand Preceptor replied: It is not so. There are things one likes and things one dislikes in one's heart, and if they suddenly clash, one's vital energy becomes confused, and one sees mistakes and therefore becomes puzzled; when the god moves, it returns. Therefore, those who are confused are lost, and those who are more so are even more puzzled.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e4b\u5584\u5fd8\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e0b\u6c23\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u8178\u80c3\u5be6\u800c\u5fc3\u80ba\u865b\u3002\u865b\u5247\u71df\u885b\u7559\u65bc\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e45\u4e4b\u4e0d\u4ee5\u6642\u4e0a\uff0c\u6545\u5584\u5fd8\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Why is it that people who are good at forgetting have such qi?

Master Qi Bo replied: The vital energy converges in the spleen, and the heat energy remains in the stomach.

The Duke of Shou replied: The vital energy does not enter the yin, and always remains in the yang.

Qi Bo replied: The Wei Qi resides in the Yin and does not move to the Yang. Residing in the Yin results in an abundance of Yin Qi.

Qi Bo replied: This person's stomach and intestines are large, and their skin is moist. They cannot differentiate the muscles. The large intestine and stomach cause the qi to linger for a long time; the moist skin causes the muscles not to differentiate, resulting in sluggishness. Qi that circulates in the daytime through Yang and at night through Yin will cease when the Yang qi is exhausted and sleep will come, and when the Yin qi is exhausted, one will awaken. Thus, when the intestines and stomach are large, the qi lingers for a long time; moist skin causes the muscles not to differentiate, resulting in sluggishness. When this lingers in the Yin for a long time, the qi does not become clear, causing one to be drowsy, thus many people sleep. People with smaller intestines and stomachs, smooth skin that moderates, and muscles that differentiate clearly, the qi that lingers in Yang for a long time will cause them to be less drowsy.</p> <p>8: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u975e\u5e38\u7d93\u4e5f\uff0c\u5352\u7136\u591a\u81e5\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u90aa\u6c23\u7559\u65bc\u4e0a\u7126\uff0c\u4e0a\u7126\u9589\u800c\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5df2\u98df\u82e5\u98f2\u6e6f\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u7559\u4e45\u65bc\u9670\u800c\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u6545\u5352\u7136\u591a\u81e5\u7109\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: This is not a serious illness, but those who sleep frequently, what Qi allows this?

When the heavens are out of order, the sun and moon become faint; when the earth loses its records, rivers overflow, grass does not thrive, and crops do not sprout; roads become inaccessible, and people cannot come and go, lanes becoming densely populated areas and cities. Thus, different places become alienated. Regarding blood and qi, please explain the cause. For the blood vessels nurture and defend [the body], circulating without rest, going up to correspond with stars and constellations, and going down to correspond with meridians and numbers. Cold pathogens invade the channels of the meridians, causing the blood to weep, which in turn does not flow, and so the qi energy returns to itself, unable to reverse [the situation], thus leading to swelling and tumors. Cold turns into heat, and heat, if it prevails, rots the flesh. Rotting flesh leads to ulcers. If ulcers are not treated, tendons become weakened and damage bones, damaging bone marrow, which does not flow into the empty spaces, causing blood to dry up, leading to emptiness in muscles, sinews, and flesh, and the meridians and vessels cannot complement each other, causing the five organs to be scorched, leading to injury and resulting in death.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u76e1\u805e\u7670\u75bd\u4e4b\u5f62\uff0c\u8207\u5fcc\u66f0\u540d\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7670\u767c\u65bc\u55cc\u4e2d\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u731b\u75bd\u3002\u731b\u75bd\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u5316\u70ba\u81bf\uff0c\u81bf\u4e0d\u5beb\uff0c\u585e\u54bd\uff0c\u534a\u65e5\u6b7b\u3002\u5176\u5316\u70ba\u81bf\u8005\uff0c\u5beb\u5247\u5408\u8c55\u818f\uff0c\u51b7\u98df\uff0c\u4e09\u65e5\u800c\u5df2\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the appearance of carbuncles and their names.

When piercing the chest or abdomen, one must use a cloth with needles sewn in; one should not shake the needle when performing acupuncture, and this is the way of piercing.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5341\u4e8c\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u7d42\uff0c\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u5176\u7d42\u4e5f\u6234\u773c\u53cd\u6298\u7608\u7632\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u767d\uff0c\u7d55\u6c57\u4e43\u51fa\uff0c\u51fa\u5247\u6b7b\u77e3\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u7d42\u8005\uff0c\u8033\u807e\u767e\u7bc0\u7686\u7e31\uff0c\u76ee\ud858\udeb7\u7d55\u7cfb\uff0c\u7d55\u7cfb\u4e00\u65e5\u534a\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u6b7b\u4e5f\uff0c\u8272\u5148\u9752\u767d\uff0c\u4e43\u6b7b\u77e3\u3002\u967d\u660e\u7d42\u8005\uff0c\u53e3\u76ee\u52d5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5584\u9a5a\u5984\u8a00\uff0c\u8272\u9ec3\uff0c\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7d93\u76db\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec1\uff0c\u5247\u7d42\u77e3\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u7d42\u8005\uff0c\u9762\u9ed1\u9f52\u9577\u800c\u57a2\uff0c\u8179\u8139\u9589\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e0d\u901a\u800c\u7d42\u77e3\u3002\u592a\u9670\u7d42\u8005\uff0c\u8179\u8139\u9589\u4e0d\u5f97\u606f\uff0c\u5584\u566b\u5584\u5614\uff0c\u5614\u5247\u9006\uff0c\u9006\u5247\u9762\u8d64\uff0c\u4e0d\u9006\u5247\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u4e0d\u901a\u5247\u9762\u9ed1\u76ae\u6bdb\u7126\u800c\u7d42\u77e3\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u7d42\u8005\uff0c\u4e2d\u71b1\u55cc\u4e7e\uff0c\u5584\u6eba\u5fc3\u7169\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u820c\u5377\u5375\u4e0a\u7e2e\u800c\u7d42\u77e3\u3002\u6b64\u5341\u4e8c\u7d93\u4e4b\u6240\u6557\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said, I hope to hear about the ending of the twelve meridians. What happens when they end? Duke Pu said: The ending of the Great Sun meridian is characterized by dizziness and vision problems, with white coloration, sweating that leads to death. The ending of the Lesser Yin meridian is marked by deafness and loss of sensation in all joints, blindness followed by coma, and death from greenish-white complexion. The ending of the Yang Ming meridian is characterized by movement of the mouth and eyes, being easily frightened and speaking nonsense, yellow coloration, and a full flow of Qi in both upper and lower meridians, but if it lacks compassion, death will follow. The ending of the Shao Yin meridian is marked by dark complexion and long teeth, with bloating of the abdomen, poor circulation in the upper and lower meridians leading to death. The ending of the Tai Yin meridian is characterized by bloating of the abdomen that does not allow breathing, being good at vomiting and hiccupping, and if there is hiccoughing, the face will turn red, if there isn't, poor circulation in the upper and lower meridians leads to dark complexion and dry skin, and ultimately death. The ending of the Ren Yin meridian is marked by an internal heat that dries up the mouth and tongue, with a tendency to drown and be bothered by the heart, which can lead to the tongue rolling up towards the yolk and death. This is what happens when the twelve meridians fail.</p>"},{"location":"17_huangdi-neijing_mai-yao-jing-wei-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u8108\u8981\u7cbe\u5fae\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u8a3a\u6cd5\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u8a3a\u6cd5\u5e38\u4ee5\u5e73\u65e6\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u672a\u52d5\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u672a\u6563\uff0c\u98f2\u98df\u672a\u9032\uff0c\u7d93\u8108\u672a\u76db\uff0c\u7d61\u8108\u8abf\u52fb\uff0c\u6c23\u8840\u672a\u4e82\uff0c\u6545\u4e43\u53ef\u8a3a\u6709\u904e\u4e4b\u8108\u3002\u5207\u8108\u52d5\u975c\u800c\u8996\u7cbe\u660e\uff0c\u5bdf\u4e94\u8272\uff0c\u89c0\u4e94\u85cf\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u516d\u5e9c\u5f37\u5f31\uff0c\u5f62\u4e4b\u76db\u8870\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u53c3\u4f0d\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u5206\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked, How is the method of diagnosis? The Duke of Shou replied, Diagnosis is usually done at noon when the yin energy has not yet moved and the yang energy has not yet dispersed. Food and drink have not been taken in yet, and the channels are not full. The network vessels are in balance, and there is no confusion in the Qi and blood. Therefore, it is possible to diagnose a patient's excesses by feeling the pulse. He said, If the pulse is active or still, one must observe the clarity of the mind. Examine the five colors, observe whether the five organs have enough or lack something, assess the strength or weakness of the six departments, determine the abundance or decline of the body form, and use all these factors to distinguish between life and death.</p> <p>2: \u592b\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u8840\u4e4b\u5e9c\u4e5f\uff0c\u9577\u5247\u6c23\u6cbb\uff0c\u77ed\u5247\u6c23\u75c5\uff0c\u6578\u5247\u7169\u5fc3\uff0c\u5927\u5247\u75c5\u9032\uff0c\u4e0a\u76db\u5247\u6c23\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0b\u76db\u5247\u6c23\u8139\uff0c\u4ee3\u5247\u6c23\u8870\uff0c\u7d30\u5247\u6c23\u5c11\uff0c\u6fc7\u5247\u5fc3\u75db\uff0c\u6e3e\u6e3e\u9769\u81f3\u5982\u6d8c\u6cc9\uff0c\u75c5\u9032\u800c\u8272\u5f0a\uff0c\u7ddc\u7ddc\u5176\u53bb\u5982\u5f26\u7d55\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u592b\u7cbe\u660e\u4e94\u8272\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u83ef\u4e5f\u3002\u8d64\u6b32\u5982\u767d\u88f9\u6731\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u5982\u8d6d\uff1b\u767d\u6b32\u5982\u9d5d\u7fbd\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u5982\u9e7d\uff1b\u9752\u6b32\u5982\u84bc\u74a7\u4e4b\u6fa4\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u5982\u85cd\uff1b\u9ec3\u6b32\u5982\u7f85\u88f9\u96c4\u9ec3\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u5982\u9ec3\u571f\uff1b\u9ed1\u6b32\u5982\u91cd\u6f06\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u5982\u5730\u84bc\u3002\u4e94\u8272\u7cbe\u5fae\u8c61\u898b\u77e3\uff0c\u5176\u58fd\u4e0d\u4e45\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u7cbe\u660e\u8005\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8996\u842c\u7269\uff0c\u5225\u767d\u9ed1\uff0c\u5be9\u77ed\u9577\u3002\u4ee5\u9577\u70ba\u77ed\uff0c\u4ee5\u767d\u70ba\u9ed1\uff0c\u5982\u662f\u5247\u7cbe\u8870\u77e3\u3002 The pulse, or beckoning, refers to the dwelling place of blood. When it is long, the qi is regulated; when short, there is a qi disorder; when irregular, there is disturbance of the heart-spirit; when deep, disease progresses; when full on top, there is a sensation of high qi; when full below, there is a sensation of bloated qi; if intermittent, there is decline of qi; if subtle, there is insufficiency of qi; if weakened, there is pain in the heart; if chaotic, like gushing springs, disease progresses and color deteriorates, like broken strings, leading to death. The radiant purity of the five colors refers to the flowering of qi. Red desires to be white, like vermillion wrappings; yellow desires to be white, like alum; green desires to be as clear as a jade basin, not like indigo; yellow desires to be like the golden wrapping of a phoenix, not like yellow earth; black desires to be like the glossy color of lacquer, not like the blue of the sky. The five colors, radiant and subtle, have appeared, but their longevity is brief. The one who perceives and discerns myriad things, distinguishing white from black, judging long and short: if he favors the short over the long, and the black over the white, then he will decline in vitality</p> <p>3: \u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5b88\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e2d\u76db\u85cf\u6eff\uff0c\u6c23\u52dd\u50b7\u6050\u8005\uff0c\u8072\u5982\u5f9e\u5ba4\u4e2d\u8a00\uff0c\u662f\u4e2d\u6c23\u4e4b\u6fd5\u4e5f\u3002\u8a00\u800c\u5fae\uff0c\u7d42\u65e5\u4e43\u5fa9\u8a00\u8005\uff0c\u6b64\u596a\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u8863\u88ab\u4e0d\u6582\uff0c\u8a00\u8a9e\u5584\u60e1\uff0c\u4e0d\u907f\u89aa\u8e08\u8005\uff0c\u6b64\u795e\u660e\u4e4b\u4e82\u4e5f\u3002\u5009\u5ee9\u4e0d\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u9580\u6236\u4e0d\u8981\u4e5f\u3002\u6c34\u6cc9\u4e0d\u6b62\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u8180\u80f1\u4e0d\u85cf\u4e5f\u3002\u5f97\u5b88\u8005\u751f\uff0c\u5931\u5b88\u8005\u6b7b\u3002\u592b\u4e94\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u8eab\u4e4b\u5f37\u4e5f\uff0c\u982d\u8005\u7cbe\u660e\u4e4b\u5e9c\uff0c\u982d\u50be\u8996\u6df1\uff0c\u7cbe\u795e\u5c07\u596a\u77e3\u3002\u80cc\u8005\u80f8\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5e9c\uff0c\u80cc\u66f2\u80a9\u96a8\uff0c\u5e9c\u5c07\u58de\u77e3\u3002\u8170\u8005\u814e\u4e4b\u5e9c\uff0c\u8f49\u6416\u4e0d\u80fd\uff0c\u814e\u5c07\u618a\u77e3\u3002\u819d\u8005\u7b4b\u4e4b\u5e9c\uff0c\u5c48\u4f38\u4e0d\u80fd\uff0c\u884c\u5247\u50c2\u9644\uff0c\u7b4b\u5c07\u618a\u77e3\u3002\u9aa8\u8005\u9ad3\u4e4b\u5e9c\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e45\u7acb\uff0c\u884c\u5247\u632f\u6389\uff0c\u9aa8\u5c07\u618a\u77e3\u3002\u5f97\u5f37\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u5931\u5f37\u5247\u6b7b\u3002 The one who keeps it is the master of the center, and when the center is full, the qi prevails over injury and fear, its voice is like speaking from inside a room, this is the dampness of the center's qi. The words are soft and subtle, all day long they change into more such words, this is losing the qi. Clothing and bedding not properly adjusted, speech good or bad, not avoiding close relatives, this is disorder of spirit and light. A warehouse without a storehouse is because the doors and windows are not closed. Springs and wells that do not stop are because the bladder is not stored. Those who have guarded it live, those who have lost it die. The five stores are the strength of the body, the head is the residence of spirit, tilting the head to look deeply, the spirit is about to be taken away. The back is the repository of the chest, bending the shoulders when the back is curved, the repository is about to deteriorate. The waist is the repository of the kidneys, unable to rotate and sway, the kidneys are about to ache. The knees are the repositories of tendons, unable to bend and straighten, walking causes them to hang and drag, the tendons are about to ache. Bones are the repositories of marrow, unable to stand for a long time, walking causes them to sway and wobble, the bones are about to ache.

Over-application results in insufficiency for essence, and insufficiency has a surplus for dissipation. The Yin and Yang do not correspond; this is called Guan Mu. Emperor asked: What is the dynamic of the pulse at the four seasons? How do we locate the source of the disease? How does the disease change? Where is the disease within? Where is the disease without? Please ask about these five things, can I hear it? Obo said: Please ask about the cycle of heavenly fate. Beyond all things, the six alignments inside; the transformation of heaven and earth, the correspondence of Yin and Yang, spring's warmth becoming summer's heat, autumn's rage becoming winter's anger, the four changes in motion, the pulse with them above and below, following the spring's median rule, the summer's median gauge, the autumn's median balance, the winter's median authority. Therefore, when winter reaches forty-five days, the Yang Qi is slightly rising, the Yin Qi is slightly descending; when summer reaches forty-five days, the Yin Qi is slightly rising, the Yang Qi is slightly descending. The correspondence of Yin and Yang has a time, which time they lose each other, knowing the pulse's division, dividing it has a time, thus knowing the time of death. Subtlety is in the pulse, not to be overlooked; examining it has records, starting from Yin and Yang, there are canons, starting from the Five Phases, having degrees of the generation, the four seasons being suitable, supplementing and not missing, corresponding with heaven and earth like one, knowing life and death. Therefore, blending the five tones, merging the five colors, merging the pulse with Yin and Yang, this knows that when Yin is dominant in dreams there are dreams of crossing great waters and being afraid, when Yang is dominant there are dreams of great fire burning and injuring, when both Yin and Yang are dominant there are dreams of killing and injuring; rising there are dreams of flying, descending there are dreams of falling; being full there are dreams of bestowing, being hungry there are dreams of taking; the Qi of the liver is dominant and there are dreams of anger, the Qi of the lung is dominant and there are dreams of crying; many worms indicate dreams of gathering crowds, many long worms indicate dreams of fighting and injuring. Therefore, holding the pulse has a way, keeping silent as protection. Spring day floating, like a fish playing in the waves; summer day on the skin, scattered among all things with some left over; autumn day beneath the skin, insects about to depart; winter day in the bones, insects tightly encircling, gentleman dwellings. Thus it is said: Knowing inside, record and examine; knowing outside, start and end. These six are the great method of holding the pulse.</p> <p>5: \u5fc3\u8108\u640f\u5805\u800c\u9577\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u820c\u5377\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff1b\u5176\u800e\u800c\u6563\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u6d88\u74b0\u81ea\u5df2\u3002\u80ba\u8108\u640f\u5805\u800c\u9577\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u553e\u8840\uff1b\u5176\u800e\u800c\u6563\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u704c\u6c57\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u4e0d\u5fa9\u6563\u767c\u4e5f\u3002\u809d\u8108\u640f\u5805\u800c\u9577\uff0c\u8272\u4e0d\u9752\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u589c\u82e5\u640f\uff0c\u56e0\u8840\u5728\u8105\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5598\u9006\uff1b\u5176\u800e\u800c\u6563\u8272\u6fa4\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u6ea2\u98f2\uff0c\u6ea2\u98f2\u8005\u6e34\u66b4\u591a\u98f2\uff0c\u800c\u6613\u5165\u808c\u76ae\u8178\u80c3\u4e4b\u5916\u4e5f\u3002\u80c3\u8108\u640f\u5805\u800c\u9577\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u8d64\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u6298\u9ac0\uff1b\u5176\u800e\u800c\u6563\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u98df\u75fa\u3002\u813e\u8108\u640f\u5805\u800c\u9577\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u9ec3\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u5c11\u6c23\uff1b\u5176\u800e\u800c\u6563\u8272\u4e0d\u6fa4\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u8db3\u4bd2\u816b\uff0c\u82e5\u6c34\u72c0\u4e5f\u3002\u814e\u8108\u640f\u5805\u800c\u9577\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u9ec3\u800c\u8d64\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u6298\u8170\uff1b\u5176\u800e\u800c\u6563\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u5c11\u8840\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u4e0d\u5fa9\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8a3a\u5f97\u5fc3\u8108\u800c\u6025\uff0c\u6b64\u70ba\u4f55\u75c5\uff0c\u75c5\u5f62\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u540d\u5fc3\u759d\uff0c\u5c11\u8179\u7576\u6709\u5f62\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u8a00\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5fc3\u70ba\u7261\u85cf\uff0c\u5c0f\u8178\u70ba\u4e4b\u4f7f\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5c11\u8179\u7576\u6709\u5f62\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8a3a\u5f97\u80c3\u8108\uff0c\u75c5\u5f62\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u80c3\u8108\u5be6\u5247\u8139\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u6cc4\u3002 The pulse is firm and prolonged, and when the tongue is tied and unable to speak during illness, it indicates heat in the liver.

Liver pulse is firm and prolonged, not green in color, indicating liver disease with jaundice; there is bleeding below the diaphragm, causing shortness of breath and inverse convulsions.

Spleen pulse is firm and prolonged, with yellow color, indicating shortness of breath; the person who recedes and scatters, indicating leg swelling and edema, like water.</p> <p>The Emperor said, When diagnosing a heart pulse that is urgent, what disease is it? What is the condition? Master He said, The name of this disease is heart obstruction, and there will be a form in the lower abdomen. The Emperor asked, What about when you diagnose a stomach pulse? What is the condition? Master He said, A full stomach pulse causes distention, while an empty one causes discharge.</p> <p>6: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u6210\u800c\u8b8a\u4f55\u8b02\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u98a8\u6210\u70ba\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u7649\u6210\u70ba\u6d88\u4e2d\uff0c\u53a5\u6210\u70ba\u5dd4\u75be\uff0c\u4e45\u98a8\u70ba\u98f1\u6cc4\uff0c\u8108\u98a8\u6210\u70ba\u7658\uff0c\u75c5\u4e4b\u8b8a\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u6578\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8af8\u7670\u816b\u7b4b\u6523\u9aa8\u75db\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u5b89\u751f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u5bd2\u6c23\u4e4b\u816b\uff0c\u516b\u98a8\u4e4b\u8b8a\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u52dd\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u6108\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u6545\u75c5\u4e94\u85cf\u767c\u52d5\uff0c\u56e0\u50b7\u8108\u8272\uff0c\u5404\u4f55\u4ee5\u77e5\u5176\u4e45\u66b4\u81f3\u4e4b\u75c5\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u5fb5\u5176\u8108\u5c0f\u8272\u4e0d\u596a\u8005\uff0c\u65b0\u75c5\u4e5f\uff1b\u5fb5\u5176\u8108\u4e0d\u596a\u5176\u8272\u596a\u8005\uff0c\u6b64\u4e45\u75c5\u4e5f\uff1b\u5fb5\u5176\u8108\u8207\u4e94\u8272\u4ff1\u596a\u8005\uff0c\u6b64\u4e45\u75c5\u4e5f\uff1b\u5fb5\u5176\u8108\u8207\u4e94\u8272\u4ff1\u4e0d\u596a\u8005\uff0c\u65b0\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u809d\u8207\u814e\u8108\u4e26\u81f3\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u84bc\u8d64\uff0c\u7576\u75c5\u6bc0\u50b7\uff0c\u4e0d\u898b\u8840\uff0c\u5df2\u898b\u8840\uff0c\u6fd5\u82e5\u4e2d\u6c34\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked, What is meant by the variation of a disease? Qi Bo replied, Wind becomes cold and heat, convulsions become expelling, stroke becomes acute, prolonged wind becomes diarrhea, pulse-wind becomes knots, and the variations of diseases are countless. The Emperor said, The swellings and tumors, painful sinews, and bone pains are all secure. Qi Bo replied, These are cold swellings and wind changes. The Emperor asked, How do you treat them? Qi Bo replied, The four seasonal diseases can be cured. If the disease arises from an injury to one of the five organs, then blood stagnation is the cause, and knowing this will help identify whether the illness is acute or chronic. The expert in pulse diagnosis asked, Is it indeed so? He said, If you can see the pulse but not grasp its color, it is a new disease. If the color of the pulse has been grasped but no longer persists, it is a chronic disease. If the color and pulse of the five organs have both been lost, it is a chronic disease. If the color and pulse of the five organs have not been lost, it is a new disease. The pulse and liver-kidney meridians converge, and their color is pale blue, indicating that there is an impending critical illness, but no blood has appeared; if blood appears, it is like water in a ditch.</p> <p>7: \u5c3a\u5167\u5169\u508d\uff0c\u5247\u5b63\u8105\u4e5f\uff0c\u5c3a\u5916\u4ee5\u5019\u814e\uff0c\u5c3a\u88cf\u4ee5\u5019\u8179\u4e2d\u3002\u9644\u4e0a\u5de6\uff0c\u5916\u4ee5\u5019\u809d\uff0c\u5167\u4ee5\u5019\u9b32\uff1b\u53f3\uff0c\u5916\u4ee5\u5019\u80c3\uff0c\u5167\u4ee5\u5019\u813e\u3002\u4e0a\u9644\u4e0a\u53f3\uff0c\u5916\u4ee5\u5019\u80ba\uff0c\u5167\u4ee5\u5019\u80f8\u4e2d\uff1b\u5de6\uff0c\u5916\u4ee5\u5019\u5fc3\uff0c\u5167\u4ee5\u5019\u81bb\u4e2d\u3002\u524d\u4ee5\u5019\u524d\uff0c\u5f8c\u4ee5\u5019\u5f8c\u3002\u4e0a\u7adf\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u80f8\u5589\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e0b\u7adf\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u5c11\u8179\u8170\u80a1\u819d\u811b\u8db3\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4e5f\u3002 Within the cubit, there are the seasons; outside the cubit, there are the organs of the middle.

It appears to be a passage discussing the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, specifically focusing on the dynamics between Yang and Yin energies within the body and their relationship to various symptoms and diagnoses.</p> <p>In summary: 1. Imbalances of Yang (Yang excess, Yang deficiency, and Yang and Yin excess) can lead to a variety of symptoms such as fever, rapid or slow onset illnesses, harsh winds, and indications of external factors. 2. Deficiencies in Yin (Yin deficiency and Yang and Yin excess) can manifest as various symptoms such as chills, internal factors, heat in the body without sweating, excessive sweating with a cold body, bone pain, and stomach pain. 3. Overabundance of either Yang or Yin can lead to more specific symptoms such as headache, abdominal pain, back pain, neck pain, and spinal rigidity. 4. The text also discusses the importance of understanding the location and nature of imbalances within the body for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p> <p>The passage emphasizes the importance of considering both internal and external factors when diagnosing and treating illnesses in traditional Chinese medicine. It highlights the significance of determining the specific balance of Yang and Yin energies within the body to accurately identify the root cause of a patient's symptoms and formulate an effective course of treatment.</p>"},{"location":"18_huangdi-neijing_ping-ren-qi-xiang-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u5e73\u4eba\u6c23\u8c61\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5e73\u4eba\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e00\u547c\u8108\u518d\u52d5\uff0c\u4e00\u5438\u8108\u4ea6\u518d\u52d5\uff0c\u547c\u5438\u5b9a\u606f\u8108\u4e94\u52d5\uff0c\u958f\u4ee5\u592a\u606f\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u5e73\u4eba\u3002\u5e73\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u5e38\u4ee5\u4e0d\u75c5\u8abf\u75c5\u4eba\uff0c\u91ab\u4e0d\u75c5\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u75c5\u4eba\u5e73\u606f\u4ee5\u8abf\u4e4b\u70ba\u6cd5\u3002\u4eba\u4e00\u547c\u8108\u4e00\u52d5\uff0c\u4e00\u5438\u8108\u4e00\u52d5\uff0c\u66f0\u5c11\u6c23\u3002\u4eba\u4e00\u547c\u8108\u4e09\u52d5\uff0c\u4e00\u5438\u8108\u4e09\u52d5\u800c\u8e81\uff0c\u5c3a\u71b1\u66f0\u75c5\u6eab\uff0c\u5c3a\u4e0d\u71b1\u8108\u6ed1\u66f0\u75c5\u98a8\uff0c\u8108\u6fc7\u66f0\u75fa\u3002\u4eba\u4e00\u547c\u8108\u56db\u52d5\u4ee5\u4e0a\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u8108\u7d55\u4e0d\u81f3\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u4e4d\u8e08\u4e4d\u6578\u66f0\u6b7b\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked: What is a person in a state of equilibrium? The Duke answered: A person's pulse quickens when they inhale and when they exhale, the five movements of respiration are harmonious. When one rests between breaths, it is called a person in a state of equilibrium. A person in a state of equilibrium is not sick. Doctors often use equilibriums to treat sick patients. A person's pulse moves when they inhale and when they exhale, it is said that there is a lack of qi. If a person's pulse moves three times when they inhale and exhale, they become agitated, an elevated pulse indicates a fever, and if the pulse is slippery but not elevated, it indicates wind sickness. A pulse that is irregular is called paralysis. If a person's pulse moves four or more times with one breath, it is said to be dying, and if the pulse suddenly stops, it is also considered dying.</p> <p>2: \u5e73\u4eba\u4e4b\u5e38\u6c23\u7a1f\u65bc\u80c3\uff0c\u80c3\u8005\uff0c\u5e73\u4eba\u4e4b\u5e38\u6c23\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eba\u65e0\u80c3\u6c23\u66f0\u9006\uff0c\u9006\u8005\u6b7b\u3002\u6625\u80c3\u5fae\u5f26\u66f0\u5e73\uff0c\u5f26\u591a\u80c3\u5c11\u66f0\u809d\u75c5\uff0c\u4f46\u5f26\u65e0\u80c3\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u80c3\u800c\u6709\u6bdb\u66f0\u79cb\u75c5\uff0c\u6bdb\u751a\u66f0\u4eca\u75c5\u3002\u85cf\u771f\u6563\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u809d\u85cf\u52f1\u819c\u4e4b\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u590f\u80c3\u5fae\u9264\u66f0\u5e73\uff0c\u9264\u591a\u80c3\u5c11\u66f0\u5fc3\u75c5\uff0c\u4f46\u9264\u65e0\u80c3\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u80c3\u800c\u6709\u77f3\u66f0\u51ac\u75c5\uff0c\u77f3\u751a\u66f0\u4eca\u75c5\u3002\u85cf\u771f\u901a\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u85cf\u8840\u8108\u4e4b\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u9577\u590f\u80c3\u5fae\u800e\u5f31\u66f0\u5e73\uff0c\u5f31\u591a\u80c3\u5c11\u66f0\u813e\u75c5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u65e0\u80c3\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u800e\u5f31\u6709\u77f3\u66f0\u51ac\u75c5\uff0c\u5f31\u751a\u66f0\u4eca\u75c5\u3002\u85cf\u771f\u6fe1\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u813e\u85cf\u808c\u8089\u4e4b\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u79cb\u80c3\u5fae\u6bdb\u66f0\u5e73\uff0c\u6bdb\u591a\u80c3\u5c11\u66f0\u80ba\u75c5\uff0c\u4f46\u6bdb\u65e0\u80c3\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u6bdb\u800c\u6709\u5f26\u66f0\u6625\u75c5\uff0c\u5f26\u751a\u66f0\u4eca\u75c5\u3002\u85cf\u771f\u9ad8\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u4ee5\u884c\u69ae\u885b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\u3002\u51ac\u80c3\u5fae\u77f3\u66f0\u5e73\uff0c\u77f3\u591a\u80c3\u5c11\u66f0\u814e\u75c5\uff0c\u4f46\u77f3\u65e0\u80c3\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u77f3\u800c\u6709\u9264\u66f0\u590f\u75c5\uff0c\u9264\u751a\u66f0\u4eca\u75c5\u3002\u85cf\u771f\u4e0b\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u814e\u85cf\u9aa8\u9ad3\u4e4b\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u80c3\u4e4b\u5927\u7d61\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u865b\u91cc\uff0c\u8cab\u9b32\u7d61\u80ba\uff0c\u51fa\u65bc\u5de6\u4e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u52d5\u61c9\u8863\uff0c\u8108\u5b97\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u76db\u5598\u6578\u7d55\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u5728\u4e2d\uff1b\u7d50\u800c\u6a6b\uff0c\u6709\u7a4d\u77e3\uff1b\u7d55\u4e0d\u81f3\u66f0\u6b7b\u3002\u4e73\u4e4b\u4e0b\u5176\u52d5\u61c9\u8863\uff0c\u5b97\u6c23\u6cc4\u4e5f\u3002 The balance of Qi is located in the stomach, and the stomach is where the balance of Qi resides. When there is no stomach Qi, it is called reversal, which results in death. In spring, when the Qi is thin and weak, it is called a balanced state. If the Qi is excessive and the stomach is weak, it is diagnosed as liver disease. However, if there is no Qi in the stomach, it is referred to as winter illness, and if it's severe, it's considered today's disease. When there are hairs on the stomach, it indicates autumn illness. If the hairs are excessive and the stomach is weak, it is diagnosed as lung disease. But if there are no Qi in the stomach, it's referred to as spring illness, and if it's severe, it's considered today's disease. The genuine Qi resides in the lungs, which controls the defense of yin and yang. When the Qi is microscopic and weak, it is called a balanced state. If the Qi is excessive and the stomach is weak, it is diagnosed as spleen disease. If there are stones in the stomach, it indicates winter illness. If it's severe, it's considered today's disease. The genuine Qi flows through the spleen, which nourishes the muscles. When the Qi is thin and weak, it's called a balanced state. If the Qi is excessive and the stomach is weak, it's diagnosed as liver disease. But if there are no Qi in the stomach, it's referred to as winter illness, and if it's severe, it's considered today's disease. The genuine Qi resides in the kidneys, which govern the bones and marrow. The meridian of the stomach, known as Xi Cleft, passes through the lung and exits from the left breast, representing the protective Qi and pulse. When there is persistent coughing, it indicates an illness within the body; if it's blocked, it has accumulated; if it doesn't reach the point of death. Beneath the breast, the pulse represents the protective Qi flowing out as a leak.</p> <p>3: \u6b32\u77e5\u5bf8\u53e3\u592a\u904e\u8207\u4e0d\u53ca\uff0c\u5bf8\u53e3\u4e4b\u8108\u4e2d\u624b\u77ed\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u982d\u75db\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u8108\u4e2d\u624b\u9577\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u8db3\u811b\u75db\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u8108\u4e2d\u624b\u4fc3\u4e0a\u64ca\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u80a9\u80cc\u75db\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u8108\u6c88\u800c\u5805\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u75c5\u5728\u4e2d\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u8108\u6d6e\u800c\u76db\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u75c5\u5728\u5916\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u8108\u6c88\u800c\u5f31\uff0c\u66f0\u5bd2\u71b1\u53ca\u759d\u7615\u5c11\u8179\u75db\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u8108\u6c88\u800c\u6a6b\uff0c\u66f0\u8107\u4e0b\u6709\u7a4d\uff0c\u8179\u4e2d\u6709\u6a6b\u7a4d\u75db\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u8108\u6c88\u800c\u5598\uff0c\u66f0\u5bd2\u71b1\u3002\u8108\u76db\u6ed1\u5805\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u75c5\u5728\u5916\u3002\u8108\u5c0f\u5be6\u800c\u5805\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u5167\u3002\u8108\u5c0f\u5f31\u4ee5\u6fc7\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u4e45\u75c5\u3002\u8108\u6ed1\u6d6e\u800c\u75be\u8005\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u65b0\u75c5\u3002\u8108\u6025\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u759d\u7615\u5c11\u8179\u75db\u3002\u8108\u6ed1\u66f0\u98a8\u3002\u8108\u6fc7\u66f0\u75fa\u3002\u7de9\u800c\u6ed1\u66f0\u71b1\u4e2d\u3002\u76db\u800c\u7dca\u66f0\u8139\u3002 To determine the location of a patient's illness, the speed and depth of the pulse at the inch point can be analyzed. If the pulse is shallow and short, it indicates head pain. If the pulse is deep and long, it indicates ankle pain. If the pulse is abrupt and strong, it suggests shoulder and back pain. A sinking and firm pulse indicates that the disease is in the center. A floating and abundant pulse indicates that the disease is outside. A sinking and weak pulse suggests cold and heat, as well as pain in the groin, lower abdomen, or sciatica. A sinking and horizontal pulse indicates a lump in the loins and pain in the abdomen. A sinking and panting pulse suggests cold and heat. A full and slippery pulse indicates that the disease is outside. A small and real pulse with firmness implies an internal illness. If the pulse is small, weak, and unclear, it means a long-standing illness. A rapid and slippery pulse indicates a recent illness. A rushing pulse suggests pain in the lower abdomen, groin, or sciatica. A slick pulse suggests wind. A sluggish and slippery pulse suggests fever. A full and tight pulse suggests distention.</p> <p>4: \u8108\u5f9e\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u75c5\u6613\u5df2\uff1b\u8108\u9006\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u75c5\u96e3\u5df2\u3002\u8108\u5f97\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u9806\uff0c\u66f0\u75c5\u65e0\u4ed6\uff1b\u8108\u53cd\u56db\u6642\u53ca\u4e0d\u9592\u85cf\uff0c\u66f0\u96e3\u5df2\u3002 The pulse arises from yin and yang, and the disease is easy to understand; when the pulse is reversed in yin and yang, the disease is difficult.

If there is no Qi in the Conception Vessel (Ren Mai) but true Sea of Qi (Yuan Shen) is present, then one will still not die. When the Qi does not reach the Conception Vessel, the Liver and Kidney do not function properly. The Sun and Lesser Yin channels are long when they arrive; the Former Heaven and Latter Heaven channels are irregular in length. When the Heart channel comes evenly, like a string of pearls or a continuous jade disc, it indicates that the heart is at peace. If the channel from the heart is disordered, wheezing and unstable, it means the heart is not at ease. If the channel from the heart becomes twisted and stays in the back, it means the heart has stopped functioning. When the Lung channel arrives evenly, like fallen bamboo shoots, it indicates that the lungs are at peace. If the channel from the lungs is disordered, rising and falling unpredictably, it means the lungs are not at ease. If the channel from the lungs floats erratically, like a feather in the wind, it means the lungs have stopped functioning. When the Liver channel arrives calmly, weak and gentle, like the tip of a long staff, it indicates that the liver is at peace. If the Liver channel is full and slippery, like a long staff, it means the liver is not at ease. If the Liver channel becomes tense and forceful, like a newly stretched bowstring, it means the liver has stopped functioning. When the Spleen channel arrives evenly, soft and gentle, like a chicken's footsteps, it indicates that the spleen is at peace. If the Spleen channel is full and present, like a chicken raising its leg, it means the spleen is not at ease. If the Spleen channel becomes sharp and rigid, like a crow's beak, like a bird's distance, like a crack in a wall, like a leaking stream, it means the spleen has stopped functioning. When the Kidney channel arrives evenly, wheezing and accumulating, it indicates that the kidneys are at peace. If the channel from the kidneys is disordered, becoming increasingly rigid, it means the kidneys are not at ease. If the channel from the kidneys comes like a noose, leaping and bounding like a bouncing ball, it means the kidneys have stopped functioning.</p>"},{"location":"19_huangdi-neijing_yu-ji-zhen-cang-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u7389\u6a5f\u771f\u85cf\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u8108\u5982\u5f26\uff0c\u4f55\u5982\u800c\u5f26\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u8108\u8005\u809d\u4e5f\uff0c\u6771\u65b9\u6728\u4e5f\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u59cb\u751f\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u5176\u6c23\u4f86\uff0c\u800e\u5f31\u8f15\u865b\u800c\u6ed1\uff0c\u7aef\u76f4\u4ee5\u9577\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5f26\uff0c\u53cd\u6b64\u8005\u75c5\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u5982\u800c\u53cd\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6c23\u4f86\u5be6\u800c\u5f37\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u5916\uff1b\u5176\u6c23\u4f86\u4e0d\u5be6\u800c\u5fae\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u4e0d\u53ca\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u4e2d\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u8108\u592a\u904e\u8207\u4e0d\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u7686\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592a\u904e\u5247\u4ee4\u4eba\u5584\u5fd8\uff0c\u5ffd\u5ffd\u7729\u5192\u800c\u5dd4\u75be\uff1b\u5176\u4e0d\u53ca\uff0c\u5247\u4ee4\u4eba\u80f8\u75db\u5f15\u80cc\uff0c\u4e0b\u5247\u5169\u8107\u80e0\u6eff\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Emperor asked: What is the spring Qi like, and how is the Qi of the spring like a string? He Bo replied: The spring Qi is the liver, representing the east direction and wood, which is the source of the birth of all things. Therefore its energy comes out, strong but weak and light, subtle and slippery, upright and long, hence it is called string, and this refers to illness. Emperor asked: How is the reversed state like? He Bo said: Its Qi is strong and excessive, which means excess on the outside; its Qi is weak and faint, meaning insufficiency within. Emperor asked: What are the diseases when spring Qi is excessive or insufficient? He Bo replied: When it is excessive, it makes people prone to forgetting, dizzy and staggering with a sharp pain; when it is insufficient, it causes pain in the chest referring to the back, and below causing fullness on both sides of the waist.

The Duke replied: Summer pulse is the heart, and the heat in the south; the source of the growth and prolongation of all things. Therefore its Qi comes and goes abundantly, hence the term 'hook.' But when it is otherwise, there is illness. The Emperor asked, What is it like when it is otherwise? The Duke replied: Its Qi also comes and goes abundantly, which is called excess, the illness being outside. When its Qi does not come and go in abundance but comes in abundance instead, this is called deficiency, the illness being inside. The Emperor asked, What are the illnesses caused by summer pulse excess and deficiency? The Duke replied: Excess causes the person to have a hot body with painful skin and itching; deficiency causes restlessness of mind, with foaming saliva above and the release of gas below.

How does it feel when it is superficial?  Obscure Scholar: The Qi of autumn is associated with the lungs, which correspond to the metal element. They are responsible for gathering the essence of all things, so when its energy arises, it is light and superficial because it comes in a hurry and then dissipates quickly. This is why it's called superficial. In this case, the person is sick.  Emperor: What does it mean to be like that?  Obscure Scholar: When its energy arises, it is strong in the center but weak on the left and right. This signifies an excessive condition, with the illness being external. The other possibility is when its energy arises, it is subtle, which indicates insufficiency and the illness being internal.  Emperor: In cases of Qi excess or insufficiency, what does the illness feel like?  Obscure Scholar: When there is an excess, it causes the person to experience discomfort and back pain. When it's insufficient, it makes the person short of breath, with a reduced intake of air, and a feeling of suffocation. In cases of excessive Qi, one may see blood when exhaling and in cases of insufficient Qi, there will be an audible sound of illness from the lower abdomen.

Duke of Shou: The pulse is the Earth, and it alone nourishes the solitary orifices to moisten the four directions.  Emperor: In that case, can the good or bad pulse be seen?  Duke of Shou: The good one cannot be seen, but the bad one can be.  Emperor: How can the bad one be seen?  Duke of Shou: It comes like a flowing stream, which indicates excessive pathogenic factors, and the illness is outside; or it comes like a bird's beak, indicating inadequate pathogenic factors, and the illness is inside.  Emperor: Master, you say that the pulse represents the solitary orifices, which are nourished by Earth to moisten the four directions, and your explanation of excessive and inadequate pathogenic factors - how do these manifest in terms of illness?  Duke of Shou: Excessive pathogenic factors lead to the person's limbs not being raised, while inadequate pathogenic factors lead to the person's nine orifices not being open, and this is called heavy strength.  Emperor nods and stands up again, bows twice, and says: Good. I have obtained the great principle of the pulse, understanding numbers worldwide, variations in colors of the pulse, measuring the unusual and consistent, the way lies in one thing, the spirit changes without returning, returning leads to not changing, and if it loses its function, it approaches the crux of the numbers, closely observed through the subtle, sealed within the archive office, read daily, called the Jade Machine.</p> <p>6: \u85cf\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u5176\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u65bc\u5176\u6240\u52dd\uff0c\u6c23\u820d\u65bc\u5176\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u6b7b\u65bc\u5176\u6240\u4e0d\u52dd\u3002\u75c5\u4e4b\u4e14\u6b7b\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u50b3\u884c\u81f3\u5176\u6240\u4e0d\u52dd\uff0c\u75c5\u4e43\u6b7b\u3002\u6b64\u8a00\u6c23\u4e4b\u9006\u884c\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u6b7b\u3002\u809d\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u6c23\u820d\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u81f3\u80ba\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u5fc3\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u6c23\u820d\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u81f3\u814e\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u813e\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u6c23\u820d\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u81f3\u809d\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u80ba\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u6c23\u820d\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u81f3\u5fc3\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u814e\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u6c23\u820d\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u81f3\u813e\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u6b64\u7686\u9006\u6b7b\u4e5f\u3002\u4e00\u65e5\u4e00\u591c\u4e94\u5206\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b64\u6240\u4ee5\u5360\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u65e9\u66ae\u4e5f\u3002 What is received in the lungs and transmitted to the heart, with qi departing from the kidneys, will die at what it cannot control. Disease must first run its course at what one cannot control, and disease leads to death. This refers to the reverse flow of qi, hence death. The liver receives qi in the heart, transmits it to the spleen, qi departs from the kidneys, and dies at the lungs. The heart receives qi in the spleen, transmits it to the lungs, qi departs from the kidneys, and dies at the liver. The spleen receives qi in the lungs, transmits it to the kidneys, qi departs from the heart, and dies at the liver. The kidneys receive qi in the liver, transmit it to the heart, qi departs from the lungs, and die at the spleen. All of these are reverse deaths. Each day and night is divided into five watches, which determines whether one will die early or late.</p> <p>7: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u85cf\u76f8\u901a\uff0c\u79fb\u7686\u6709\u6b21\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u6709\u75c5\uff0c\u5247\u5404\u50b3\u5176\u6240\u52dd\u3002\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u6cd5\u4e09\u6708\u82e5\u516d\u6708\uff0c\u82e5\u4e09\u65e5\u82e5\u516d\u65e5\uff0c\u50b3\u4e94\u85cf\u800c\u7576\u6b7b\uff0c\u662f\u9806\u50b3\u6240\u52dd\u4e4b\u6b21\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5225\u65bc\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u75c5\u5f9e\u4f86\uff1b\u5225\u65bc\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u671f\u3002\u8a00\u77e5\u81f3\u5176\u6240\u56f0\u800c\u6b7b\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: When the Five Organs are connected, moving any one of them has a specific time, and if the Five Organs have diseases, they will pass on their respective strengths. If not treated, according to the law, it may be three months or six months, or three days or six days, passing on the Five Organs means certain death, which is the strength of the successive transmission. Therefore, he said: Separating from yang knows that the disease has always been there; separating from yin knows the time of life and death.

Today, cold winds affect people, causing their hair to stand on end, their skin to close and generate heat, at which time one can sweat; or there is stiffness and numbness, with swelling and pain, at which time one should use warm baths, moxibustion, and acupuncture to treat it. If not treated, the illness settles in the lungs and is called lung stiffness, accompanied by a cough. If not treated, the lung energy blocks the liver, and the disease is called liver stiffness, also known as Qi, with pain in the flanks and fullness in the abdomen; at this time, pressing around the ears can help. If not treated, the liver energy blockage passes to the spleen, and the disease is called spleen wind, with lower abdominal pain and heat, accompanied by yellow discharge, at which time pressing, herbs, and bathing can help. If not treated, the kidney energy blocks the heart, and the heart channels the energy to the lungs, causing cold and heat; if untreated, one will die at three years old, this is the sequence of the disease.</p> <p>9: \u7136\u5176\u5352\u767c\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u6cbb\u65bc\u50b3\uff0c\u6216\u5176\u50b3\u5316\u6709\u4e0d\u4ee5\u6b21\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ee5\u6b21\u5165\u8005\uff0c\u6182\u6050\u60b2\u559c\u6012\uff0c\u4ee4\u4e0d\u5f97\u4ee5\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6545\u4ee4\u4eba\u6709\u5927\u75c5\u77e3\u3002\u56e0\u800c\u559c\u5927\u865b\u5247\u814e\u6c23\u4e58\u77e3\uff0c\u6012\u5247\u809d\u6c23\u4e58\u77e3\uff0c\u60b2\u5247\u80ba\u6c23\u4e58\u77e3\uff0c\u6050\u5247\u813e\u6c23\u4e58\u77e3\uff0c\u6182\u5247\u5fc3\u6c23\u4e58\u77e3\uff0c\u6b64\u5176\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u75c5\u6709\u4e94\uff0c\u4e94\u4e94\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u8b8a\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u50b3\u5316\u3002\u50b3\uff0c\u4e58\u4e4b\u540d\u4e5f\u3002 Those who are suddenly enlightened should not be treated according to tradition, as the tradition may become outdated or misunderstood. If one's emotions include sorrow, joy, anger, and fear, they will not be able to control their own nature, and thus they will fall ill. This is why people who experience sudden enlightenment often develop serious illnesses. Since joy causes the vital energy of the kidneys to rise, anger causes the vital energy of the liver to rise, sorrow causes the vital energy of the lungs to rise, fear causes the vital energy of the spleen to rise, and worry causes the vital energy of the heart to rise, this is their nature. Thus, illnesses arise in five types, with each type having five variations, and these are related to tradition and change.

If the appearance and vital energy are harmonious, it is treatable; if the color and complexion are bright, it is easily cured; if the pulses correspond to the four seasons, it is treatable; if the pulse is weak and slippery, there is stomach qi, and it is called easy to cure. Take advantage of the opportunity when the time is right. If the appearance and vital energy are not harmonious, it is difficult to treat; if the color and complexion are withered and not bright, it is difficult to cure; if the pulse is strong and firm, it means there is much disease; if the pulse is opposite the four seasons, it is incurable. Carefully observe the four difficulties and report them clearly. The so-called opposite four seasons refers to the spring when the lung pulse is present, summer when the kidney pulse is present, autumn when the heart pulse is present, and winter when the spleen pulse is present. All cases where the pulse is sunken and weak in spring and summer, and floating large in autumn and winter are called the opposite four seasons. If there is no consolidation of form, and if the pulse is sunken and weak in spring and summer, and floating large in autumn and winter, it is called the opposite four seasons. In cases where the disease is hot and the pulse is calm, sweating with a large pulse, bleeding with a real pulse, or having a strong and firm pulse inside and a weak and unstable pulse outside, all are difficult to treat.</p> <p>12: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u865b\u5be6\u4ee5\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u60c5\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u5be6\u6b7b\uff0c\u4e94\u865b\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u4e94\u5be6\u4e94\u865b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u76db\uff0c\u76ae\u71b1\uff0c\u8179\u8139\uff0c\u524d\u5f8c\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u60b6\u7780\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u4e94\u5be6\u3002\u8108\u7d30\uff0c\u76ae\u5bd2\uff0c\u6c23\u5c11\uff0c\u6cc4\u5229\u524d\u5f8c\uff0c\u98f2\u98df\u4e0d\u5165\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u4e94\u865b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6642\u6709\u751f\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6f3f\u7ca5\u5165\u80c3\uff0c\u6cc4\u6ce8\u6b62\uff0c\u5247\u865b\u8005\u6d3b\uff1b\u8eab\u6c57\u5f97\u5f8c\u5229\uff0c\u5247\u5be6\u8005\u6d3b\u3002\u6b64\u5176\u5019\u4e5f\u3002 The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that the distinction between real and false determines life and death, and I wish to hear about its nature. Hui Bo said: Five things are real in death, five things are false in death. Emperor said: I wish to hear about the five real and five false. Hui Bo said: Pulse full, skin hot, abdomen bloated, front and back not connected, restlessness, these are called the five real. Pulse thin, skin cold, qi deficient, leakage of the front and back, food and drink do not enter, these are called the five false. Emperor said: At that time, what is life? Hui Bo said: If rice gruel enters the stomach and leakage stops, then the empty ones will live; if the body sweats and gets posterior discharge, then the full ones will live.

Though weak at birth, he could speak fluently, as a young child he imitated Qi, growing up he showed great intelligence and wisdom, and in his later years, ascended to the level of a sage.</p> <p>He questioned the Master of Heaven, saying: I have heard that people from ancient times, during the Spring and Autumn period, lived to be over one hundred years old without decaying physically. However, people today, even if they live to be fifty years old, show signs of decay. Is this not a sign of the times? Are people soon to lose this ability?</p> <p>The Duke replied: In ancient times, those who understood the way of life, relied on the principles of Yin and Yang, harmonized their actions with the arts of numerology, maintained discipline in diet and dwelling, avoided unnecessary labor, and as a result were able to sustain both their bodies and spirits, reaching their full lifespan of one hundred years before passing. People today do not follow this path; they rely on wine as glue, indulge in frivolous behavior, become intoxicated in their chambers, exhaust their essence through lust, and dissipate their true nature through excessive activity, without understanding the importance of preserving their vital energy, failing to govern their spirits properly, and hastening their decline. This is why people today, even if they live to be fifty years old, show signs of decay.</p> <p>2: \u592b\u4e0a\u53e4\u8056\u4eba\u4e4b\u6559\u4e0b\u4e5f\uff0c\u7686\u8b02\u4e4b\u865b\u90aa\u8cca\u98a8\uff0c\u907f\u4e4b\u6709\u6642\uff0c\u606c\u60d4\u865b\u65e0\uff0c\u771f\u6c23\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u7cbe\u795e\u5167\u5b88\uff0c\u75c5\u5b89\u5f9e\u4f86\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u5fd7\u9591\u800c\u5c11\u6b32\uff0c\u5fc3\u5b89\u800c\u4e0d\u61fc\uff0c\u5f62\u52de\u800c\u4e0d\u5026\uff0c\u6c23\u5f9e\u4ee5\u9806\uff0c\u5404\u5f9e\u5176\u6b32\uff0c\u7686\u5f97\u6240\u9858\u3002\u6545\u7f8e\u5176\u98df\uff0c\u4efb\u5176\u670d\uff0c\u6a02\u5176\u4fd7\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e0b\u4e0d\u76f8\u6155\uff0c\u5176\u6c11\u6545\u66f0\u6734\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u55dc\u6b32\u4e0d\u80fd\u52de\u5176\u76ee\uff0c\u6deb\u90aa\u4e0d\u80fd\u60d1\u5176\u5fc3\uff0c\u611a\u667a\u8ce2\u4e0d\u8096\u4e0d\u61fc\u65bc\u7269\uff0c\u6545\u5408\u65bc\u9053\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u80fd\u5e74\u7686\u5ea6\u767e\u6b72\uff0c\u800c\u52d5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u8870\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u5fb7\u5168\u4e0d\u5371\u4e5f\u3002 Since ancient sages' teaching, all referred to it as empty, evil, counterfeit wind, avoiding it at times, being tranquil and empty-minded, following the genuine energy, guarding the spirit within, health coming by itself. Therefore, cherishing desires but keeping one's willpower in check, having a peaceful mind without fear, exerting oneself physically but not becoming weary, following one's own inclinations, all getting what they wish. Thus, praising their food, allowing their medicine, enjoying their customs, not coveting high or low positions, the people of this country call it primitive. This is why desire cannot exhaust their eyesight, lust and evil cannot confuse their minds, ignorance of wisdom but sages do not fear things, so they follow the Dao. Therefore, able to live long, all reaching a hundred years, with movements not decaying, this is because their virtue is complete and not in danger also.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u5e74\u8001\u800c\u7121\u5b50\u8005\uff0c\u6750\u529b\u76e1\u90aa\uff0c\u5c07\u5929\u6578\u7136\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5973\u5b50\u4e03\u6b72\uff0c\u814e\u6c23\u76db\uff0c\u9f52\u66f4\u9aee\u9577\uff1b\u4e8c\u4e03\u800c\u5929\u7678\u81f3\uff0c\u4efb\u8108\u901a\uff0c\u592a\u885d\u8108\u76db\uff0c\u6708\u4e8b\u4ee5\u6642\u4e0b\uff0c\u6545\u6709\u5b50\uff1b\u4e09\u4e03\uff0c\u814e\u6c23\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u6545\u771f\u7259\u751f\u800c\u9577\u6975\uff1b\u56db\u4e03\uff0c\u7b4b\u9aa8\u5805\uff0c\u9aee\u9577\u6975\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u76db\u58ef\uff1b\u4e94\u4e03\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u8108\u8870\uff0c\u9762\u59cb\u7126\uff0c\u9aee\u59cb\u58ae\uff1b\u516d\u4e03\uff0c\u4e09\u967d\u8108\u8870\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u9762\u7686\u7126\uff0c\u9aee\u59cb\u767d\uff1b\u4e03\u4e03\uff0c\u4efb\u8108\u865b\uff0c\u592a\u885d\u8108\u8870\u5c11\uff0c\u5929\u7678\u7aed\uff0c\u5730\u9053\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u6545\u5f62\u58de\u800c\u7121\u5b50\u4e5f\u3002\u4e08\u592b\u516b\u6b72\uff0c\u814e\u6c23\u5be6\uff0c\u9aee\u9577\u9f52\u66f4\uff1b\u4e8c\u516b\uff0c\u814e\u6c23\u76db\uff0c\u5929\u7678\u81f3\uff0c\u7cbe\u6c23\u6ea2\u5beb\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u548c\uff0c\u6545\u80fd\u6709\u5b50\uff1b\u4e09\u516b\uff0c\u814e\u6c23\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u7b4b\u9aa8\u52c1\u5f37\uff0c\u6545\u771f\u7259\u751f\u800c\u9577\u6975\uff1b\u56db\u516b\uff0c\u7b4b\u9aa8\u9686\u76db\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u6eff\u58ef\uff1b\u4e94\u516b\uff0c\u814e\u6c23\u8870\uff0c\u9aee\u58ae\u9f52\u69c1\uff1b\u516d\u516b\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u8870\u7aed\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u9762\u7126\uff0c\u9aee\u9b22\u9812\u767d\uff1b\u4e03\u516b\uff0c\u809d\u6c23\u8870\uff0c\u7b4b\u4e0d\u80fd\u52d5\uff0c\u5929\u7678\u7aed\uff0c\u7cbe\u5c11\uff0c\u814e\u85cf\u8870\uff0c\u5f62\u9ad4\u7686\u6975\uff1b\u516b\u516b\uff0c\u5247\u9f52\u9aee\u53bb\uff0c\u814e\u8005\u4e3b\u6c34\uff0c\u53d7\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u7cbe\u800c\u85cf\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u4e94\u85cf\u76db\uff0c\u4e43\u80fd\u5beb\u3002\u4eca\u4e94\u85cf\u7686\u8870\uff0c\u7b4b\u9aa8\u89e3\u58ae\uff0c\u5929\u7678\u76e1\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u9aee\u9b22\u767d\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u91cd\uff0c\u884c\u6b65\u4e0d\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u7121\u5b50\u8033\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u5176\u5e74\u5df2\u8001\u800c\u6709\u5b50\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u5176\u5929\u58fd\u904e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6c23\u8108\u5e38\u901a\uff0c\u800c\u814e\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u4e5f\u3002\u6b64\u96d6\u6709\u5b50\uff0c\u7537\u4e0d\u904e\u76e1\u516b\u516b\uff0c\u5973\u4e0d\u904e\u76e1\u4e03\u4e03\uff0c\u800c\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u7cbe\u6c23\u7686\u7aed\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u9053\u8005\u5e74\u7686\u767e\u6578\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u5b50\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u9053\u8005\u80fd\u537b\u8001\u800c\u5168\u5f62\uff0c\u8eab\u5e74\u96d6\u58fd\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u5b50\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor said: A person becomes old without offspring, and their vital energy has been exhausted, just as their time is about to end. Duke said: A girl is seven years old, her kidney energy is flourishing, her teeth change and hair grows long; at 27 when the heaven's stems are J\u012bn, the conduits are open, the Greater Y\u00edn and Lesser Y\u01d0n vessels have abundant energy, and the menstruation occurs regularly, so there will be offspring. At 37, the kidney energy is balanced, so true teeth grow and become extremely long; at 47, the tendons and bones are strong, hair grows extremely long, and the body is vigorous; at 57, the Yang M\u00edng vessels decline, the face becomes dull, and hair starts to fall out. At 67, the three Yang vessels decline in the upper part, the face becomes dull, and hair starts to turn white. At 77, the conduits are empty, the Greater Y\u00edn and Lesser Y\u01d0n vessels decline somewhat, the heaven's stems have reached their limit, and the earthly paths are not open, so the body deteriorates and there is no offspring. A man at eight years old has kidney energy that is flourishing, his hair grows long and his teeth change; at 28, the kidney energy is abundant when the heaven's stems are J\u012bn, and the essence energy overflows, the Yin and Yang are harmonious, so there can be offspring. At 38, the kidney energy is balanced, the tendons and bones have strong power, so true teeth grow and become extremely long; at 48, the tendons and bones are flourishing, the muscles are full and vigorous; at 58, the kidney energy declines, hair falls out and teeth weaken; at 68, the Yang energy declines in the upper part, the face becomes dull, and hair turns white. At 78, the liver energy declines, tendons cannot move, the heaven's stems have reached their limit, and essence is scarce, the kidney vessels decline, so the body deteriorates completely and there is no offspring. Emperor asked: Why can a person still have offspring when they are old? Duke said: This is because their lifespan exceeded what was destined, and their conduits remain open, while their kidney energy has some remaining. Although there are offspring, boys do not exceed eight at eight years old, and girls do not exceed seven at seven years old, and the essence energy of heaven and earth has been exhausted. Emperor asked: If the Dao exists, can a person have offspring when they are one hundred? Duke said: The Dao enables one to age while still maintaining their body's integrity, even though their lifespan is one hundred, they can have offspring.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e0a\u53e4\u6709\u771f\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u6308\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u628a\u63e1\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u547c\u5438\u7cbe\u6c23\uff0c\u7368\u7acb\u5b88\u795e\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u82e5\u4e00\uff0c\u6545\u80fd\u58fd\u655d\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u65e0\u6709\u7d42\u6642\uff0c\u6b64\u5176\u9053\u751f\u3002\u4e2d\u53e4\u4e4b\u6642\uff0c\u6709\u81f3\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u6df3\u5fb7\u5168\u9053\uff0c\u548c\u65bc\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u8abf\u65bc\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u53bb\u4e16\u96e2\u4fd7\uff0c\u7a4d\u7cbe\u5168\u795e\uff0c\u6e38\u884c\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u8996\u807d\u516b\u9054\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6b64\u84cb\u76ca\u5176\u58fd\u547d\u800c\u5f37\u8005\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ea6\u6b78\u65bc\u771f\u4eba\u3002\u5176\u6b21\u6709\u8056\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u8655\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u5f9e\u516b\u98a8\u4e4b\u7406\uff0c\u9069\u55dc\u6b32\u65bc\u4e16\u4fd7\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u65e0\u605a\u55d4\u4e4b\u5fc3\uff0c\u884c\u4e0d\u6b32\u96e2\u65bc\u4e16\uff0c\u88ab\u670d\u7ae0\uff0c\u8209\u4e0d\u6b32\u89c0\u65bc\u4fd7\uff0c\u5916\u4e0d\u52de\u5f62\u65bc\u4e8b\uff0c\u5167\u65e0\u601d\u60f3\u4e4b\u60a3\uff0c\u4ee5\u606c\u6109\u70ba\u52d9\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u5f97\u70ba\u529f\uff0c\u5f62\u9ad4\u4e0d\u655d\uff0c\u7cbe\u795e\u4e0d\u6563\uff0c\u4ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u767e\u6578\u3002\u5176\u6b21\u6709\u8ce2\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u6cd5\u5247\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u8c61\u4f3c\u65e5\u6708\uff0c\u8faf\u5217\u661f\u8fb0\uff0c\u9006\u5f9e\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5206\u5225\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u5c07\u5f9e\u4e0a\u53e4\u5408\u540c\u65bc\u9053\uff0c\u4ea6\u53ef\u4f7f\u76ca\u58fd\u800c\u6709\u6975\u6642\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that in ancient times, there were true beings who held up Heaven and Earth, controlled Yin and Yang, breathed the divine qi, stood alone guarding the gods, their muscles as one, thus they could nourish and sustain Heaven and Earth, without an end, this is the beginning of their way. In ancient times, there were excellent people, pure virtue, complete the Way, harmonious with Yin and Yang, regulated by the four seasons, departed from worldly desires, accumulating qi and refining their spirit, roaming between Heaven and Earth, seeing and hearing beyond the eight limits, this is indeed to strengthen their life and longevity, also returning to true beings. Next are sages who dwell in harmony with Heaven and Earth, follow the principles of the eight winds, adapt their desires within worldly affairs, without resentment or anger in their hearts, they act without desiring to leave the world, wear but do not show off, lift but do not want to be seen in worldliness, externally not laboring their bodies in matters, internally without troubled thoughts, cherishing tranquility as their duty, and self-realization as their achievement, their body and spirit do not decay, and they can also extend their lives by hundreds. There are also wise people who follow the laws of Heaven and Earth, resembling the sun and moon, differentiating stars and constellations, following Yin and Yang, dividing the four seasons, joining from ancient times to combine with the Way, also able to strengthen their longevity and have an extreme limit.</p>"},{"location":"20_huangdi-neijing_san-bu-jiu-hou-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e5d\u937c\u65bc\u592b\u5b50\uff0c\u773e\u591a\u535a\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u6578\u3002\u4f59\u9858\u805e\u8981\u9053\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c6c\u5b50\u5b6b\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u5f8c\u4e16\uff0c\u8457\u4e4b\u9aa8\u9ad3\uff0c\u85cf\u4e4b\u809d\u80ba\uff0c\u6b43\u8840\u800c\u53d7\uff0c\u4e0d\u6562\u5984\u6cc4\uff0c\u4ee4\u5408\u5929\u9053\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u7d42\u59cb\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u5929\u5149\u661f\u8fb0\u6b77\u7d00\uff0c\u4e0b\u526f\u56db\u6642\u4e94\u884c\uff0c\u8cb4\u8ce4\u66f4\u4e92\uff0c\u51ac\u9670\u590f\u967d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4eba\u61c9\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u65b9\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u5999\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\uff01\u6b64\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u81f3\u6578\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u81f3\u6578\uff0c\u5408\u65bc\u4eba\u5f62\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u901a\uff0c\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\uff0c\u70ba\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u81f3\u6578\uff0c\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e5d\u7109\u3002\u4e00\u8005\u5929\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5730\uff0c\u4e09\u8005\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u4e09\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e09\u4e09\u8005\u4e5d\uff0c\u4ee5\u61c9\u4e5d\u91ce\u3002\u6545\u4eba\u6709\u4e09\u90e8\uff0c\u90e8\u6709\u4e09\u5019\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\uff0c\u4ee5\u8655\u767e\u75c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8abf\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u800c\u9664\u90aa\u75be\u3002 Emperor asked: I have heard that the Nine Needles from Confucius are abundant and vast, impossible to count. I wish to hear about the true method, which belongs to Father and Son, passed down to future generations, embedded in bone marrow, hidden in liver and lungs, drained of blood and endured, not daring to reveal frivolously, connecting with the celestial principle, there must be an ultimate beginning, above following the light of heaven, stars, and constellations recording history, below assisting the four seasons and five elements, nobility and lowliness alternating, winter as yin and summer as yang, how should people respond to this? The Duke answered: What a profound question! This concerns the ultimate number of heaven and earth. Emperor asked: I wish to hear about the ultimate number of heaven and earth, connecting with human form, blood and qi circulating, determining life and death, how should it be done? The Duke said: The ultimate number of heaven and earth begins with one and ends with nine. One is heaven, two is earth, three is humanity, thus leading to three, and the three threes become nine, in response to the nine wildernesses. Therefore, humans have three parts, each part has three stages, determining life and death, treating a hundred diseases, adjusting between emptiness and reality, and eliminating deviant illnesses.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u4e09\u90e8\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u4e0b\u90e8\uff0c\u6709\u4e2d\u90e8\uff0c\u6709\u4e0a\u90e8\uff0c\u90e8\u5404\u6709\u4e09\u5019\uff0c\u4e09\u5019\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5929\u6709\u5730\u6709\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fc5\u6307\u800c\u5c0e\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e43\u4ee5\u70ba\u771f\u3002\u4e0a\u90e8\u5929\uff0c\u5169\u984d\u4e4b\u52d5\u8108\uff1b\u4e0a\u90e8\u5730\uff0c\u5169\u984d\u4e4b\u52d5\u8108\uff1b\u4e0a\u90e8\u4eba\uff0c\u8033\u524d\u4e4b\u52d5\u8108\u3002\u4e2d\u90e8\u5929\uff0c\u624b\u592a\u9670\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e2d\u90e8\u5730\uff0c\u624b\u967d\u660e\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e2d\u90e8\u4eba\uff0c\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0b\u90e8\u5929\uff0c\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e0b\u90e8\u5730\uff0c\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e0b\u90e8\u4eba\uff0c\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u4e0b\u90e8\u4e4b\u5929\u4ee5\u5019\u809d\uff0c\u5730\u4ee5\u5019\u814e\uff0c\u4eba\u4ee5\u5019\u813e\u80c3\u4e4b\u6c23\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e2d\u90e8\u4e4b\u5019\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4ea6\u6709\u5929\uff0c\u4ea6\u6709\u5730\uff0c\u4ea6\u6709\u4eba\u3002\u5929\u4ee5\u5019\u80ba\uff0c\u5730\u4ee5\u5019\u80f8\u4e2d\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u4eba\u4ee5\u5019\u5fc3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u90e8\u4ee5\u4f55\u5019\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4ea6\u6709\u5929\uff0c\u4ea6\u6709\u5730\uff0c\u4ea6\u6709\u4eba\uff0c\u5929\u4ee5\u5019\u982d\u89d2\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u5730\u4ee5\u5019\u53e3\u9f52\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u4eba\u4ee5\u5019\u8033\u76ee\u4e4b\u6c23\u3002\u4e09\u90e8\u8005\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u5929\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u5730\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u4eba\u3002\u4e09\u800c\u6210\u5929\uff0c\u4e09\u800c\u6210\u5730\uff0c\u4e09\u800c\u6210\u4eba\uff0c\u4e09\u800c\u4e09\u4e4b\uff0c\u5408\u5247\u70ba\u4e5d\uff0c\u4e5d\u5206\u70ba\u4e5d\u91ce\uff0c\u4e5d\u91ce\u70ba\u4e5d\u85cf\u3002\u6545\u795e\u85cf\u4e94\uff0c\u5f62\u85cf\u56db\uff0c\u5408\u70ba\u4e5d\u85cf\u3002\u4e94\u85cf\u5df2\u6557\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u5fc5\u592d\uff0c\u592d\u5fc5\u6b7b\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4ee5\u5019\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5fc5\u5148\u5ea6\u5176\u5f62\u4e4b\u80a5\u7626\uff0c\u4ee5\u8abf\u5176\u6c23\u4e4b\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u5be6\u5247\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u88dc\u4e4b\u3002\u5fc5\u5148\u53bb\u5176\u8840\u8108\u800c\u5f8c\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u7121\u554f\u5176\u75c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u70ba\u671f\u3002 The sovereign asked, What is meant by the Three Departments? The Duke of Shou replied, There are lower, middle, and upper departments. In each department, there are three candidates: heaven, earth, and man. These are led and guided accordingly, thereby considered to be true. </p> <p>The upper department of heaven corresponds to the greater yin, the governing vessel; the upper department of earth corresponds to the greater yang, the conception vessel; and the upper department of man corresponds to the yin channel of the face. </p> <p>The middle department of heaven corresponds to the hand Taiyin (medial), the lung; the middle department of earth corresponds to the hand Yangming (bright), the heart; and the middle department of man corresponds to the hand Shaoyin (lesser yin), the spleen and stomach. </p> <p>The lower department of heaven corresponds to the foot Wei (towards the sun) and corresponds to the candidate bladder; the lower department of earth corresponds to the foot Shaoyang (lesser yang), the kidneys; and the lower department of man corresponds to the foot Taiyang (greater yang), the gallbladder. </p> <p>Thus, the lower department of heaven governs the liver through the candidate, the lower department of earth governs the kidneys through the candidate, and the lower department of man governs the spleen and stomach through the candidate. </p> <p>The sovereign asked, How about the middle department? The Duke of Shou replied, There are also heaven, earth, and man. Heaven corresponds to the candidate lung, earth corresponds to the chest qi, and man corresponds to the heart. </p> <p>The sovereign asked, What candidates are there for the upper department? The Duke of Shou replied, There are also heaven, earth, and man. Heaven corresponds to the head yang channel, earth corresponds to the mouth and teeth channel, and man corresponds to the eye-ear channel. </p> <p>The Three Departments each have their own heaven, earth, and man. Three make one heaven, three make one earth, three make one man, three threes become nine, which are divided into nine orifices, and the nine orifices house the nine storage areas. Therefore, the spiritual storage areas combine to form the nine storage areas. When the five storage areas have been defeated, their colors will wither, leading to death. </p> <p>The sovereign asked, What is the prognosis? The Duke of Shou replied, First, one must adjust the patient's body weight and regulate their qi, whether it is deficient or excessive. One must first eliminate the blood vessels before regulating, without inquiring about the disease, with restoration as the goal.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5f62\u76db\u8108\u7d30\uff0c\u5c11\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u606f\u8005\uff0c\u5371\u3002\u5f62\u7626\u8108\u5927\uff0c\u80f8\u4e2d\u591a\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u5f62\u6c23\u76f8\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u751f\u3002\u53c3\u4f0d\u4e0d\u8abf\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u3002\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u7686\u76f8\u5931\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5de6\u53f3\u4e4b\u8108\u76f8\u61c9\u5982\u53c3\u8202\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u751a\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5de6\u53f3\u76f8\u5931\u4e0d\u53ef\u6578\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u4e2d\u90e8\u4e4b\u5019\u96d6\u7368\u8abf\uff0c\u8207\u773e\u85cf\u76f8\u5931\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u4e2d\u90e8\u4e4b\u5019\u76f8\u6e1b\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u76ee\u5167\u9677\u8005\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u77e5\u75c5\u4e4b\u6240\u5728\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5bdf\u4e5d\u5019\u7368\u5c0f\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff0c\u7368\u5927\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff0c\u7368\u75be\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff0c\u7368\u9072\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff0c\u7368\u71b1\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff0c\u7368\u5bd2\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff0c\u7368\u9677\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u3002\u4ee5\u5de6\u624b\u8db3\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0a\u53bb\u8e1d\u4e94\u5bf8\u6309\u4e4b\uff0c\u5eb6\u53f3\u624b\u8db3\u7576\u8e1d\u800c\u5f48\u4e4b\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u904e\u4e94\u5bf8\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8815\u8815\u7136\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u75c5\uff1b\u5176\u61c9\u75be\uff0c\u4e2d\u624b\u6e3e\u6e3e\u7136\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff1b\u4e2d\u624b\u5f90\u5f90\u7136\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\uff1b\u5176\u61c9\u4e0a\u4e0d\u80fd\u81f3\u4e94\u5bf8\uff0c\u5f48\u4e4b\u4e0d\u61c9\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u812b\u8089\u8eab\u4e0d\u53bb\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u4e2d\u90e8\u4e4d\u8e08\u4e4d\u6578\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u5176\u8108\u4ee3\u800c\u9264\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u7d61\u8108\u3002\u4e5d\u5019\u4e4b\u76f8\u61c9\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u82e5\u4e00\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u76f8\u5931\u3002\u4e00\u5019\u5f8c\u5247\u75c5\uff0c\u4e8c\u5019\u5f8c\u5247\u75c5\u751a\uff0c\u4e09\u5019\u5f8c\u5247\u75c5\u5371\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u5f8c\u8005\uff0c\u61c9\u4e0d\u4ff1\u4e5f\u3002\u5bdf\u5176\u5e9c\u85cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u671f\u3002 Emporer said: What shall be done in case of certain death?  Huang Di replied: If the body is robust but the pulse is weak, thin, and there is not enough qi to breathe, it's dangerous. If the body is emaciated, the pulse is strong and the chest is full of qi, it will lead to death. If the body and pulse are in balance, it will live. If the qi and the blood are not harmonious, it will be sick. If all three zang organs, nine shu organs fail, it will lead to death. If the qi and blood of all four limbs are harmonized like needles grinding against each other, it's serious. If the qi and blood of the body are completely lost, it will lead to death. If the zang organs in the middle are alone well balanced but fail to connect with other organs, it will lead to death. If the zang organs in the middle are alone weakened, it will lead to death. If the eyes sink, it leads to death. Emporer asked: How do you know where the disease is located?  Huang Di replied: Check the nine orifices, if there's something alone that's too small, it's sick. If it's alone and too large, it's sick. If it's alone and moving quickly, it's sick. If it's alone and moving slowly, it's sick. If it's alone and hot, it's sick. If it's alone and cold, it's sick. If it's alone and sunken below, it's sick. Press with the left hand above the ankle, go five inches down, then press with the right hand above the ankle and pluck, if it reaches over five inches and is wriggling, it's not sick. If it's too quick, the middle pulse is full of qi, it's sick. If the middle pulse is slow, it's sick. If it can't reach above five inches, plucking isn't right, it's dead. Therefore, peeling off the flesh will not lead to death. If there are irregularities in the middle, it's dead. If the pulse stops and forms a knot, the disease is in the vessels. The nine orifices should be harmonious, up and down should not fail. If one of them is late, it leads to sickness. If two of them are late, it leads to serious sickness. If three of them are late, it leads to life-threatening illness. To refer to being late means that the pulse isn't all complete. Examine its storehouse, and know its time for life or death</p> <p>4: \u5fc5\u5148\u77e5\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u77e5\u75c5\u8108\uff0c\u771f\u85cf\u8108\u898b\u8005\uff0c\u52dd\u6b7b\u3002\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u6c23\u7d55\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u8db3\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c48\u4f38\uff0c\u6b7b\u5fc5\u6234\u773c\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u51ac\u9670\u590f\u967d\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e5d\u5019\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u7686\u6c88\u7d30\u61f8\u7d55\u8005\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u4e3b\u51ac\uff0c\u6545\u4ee5\u591c\u534a\u6b7b\u3002\u76db\u8e81\u5598\u6578\u8005\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u4e3b\u590f\uff0c\u6545\u4ee5\u65e5\u4e2d\u6b7b\u3002\u662f\u6545\u5bd2\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u65e6\u6b7b\u3002\u71b1\u4e2d\u53ca\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u65e5\u4e2d\u6b7b\u3002\u75c5\u98a8\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u65e5\u5915\u6b7b\u3002\u75c5\u6c34\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u591c\u534a\u6b7b\u3002\u5176\u8108\u4e4d\u8e08\u4e4d\u6578\u4e4d\u9072\u4e4d\u75be\u8005\uff0c\u65e5\u4e58\u56db\u5b63\u6b7b\u3002\u5f62\u8089\u5df2\u812b\uff0c\u4e5d\u5019\u96d6\u8abf\uff0c\u7336\u6b7b\u3002\u4e03\u8a3a\u96d6\u898b\uff0c\u4e5d\u5019\u7686\u5f9e\u8005\u4e0d\u6b7b\u3002\u6240\u8a00\u4e0d\u6b7b\u8005\uff0c\u98a8\u6c23\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u53ca\u7d93\u6708\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e03\u8a3a\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u8a00\u4e0d\u6b7b\u3002\u82e5\u6709\u4e03\u8a3a\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u5019\u4ea6\u6557\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u77e3\uff0c\u5fc5\u767c\u5666\u566b\u3002\u5fc5\u5be9\u554f\u5176\u6240\u59cb\u75c5\uff0c\u8207\u4eca\u4e4b\u6240\u65b9\u75c5\uff0c\u800c\u5f8c\u5404\u5207\u5faa\u5176\u8108\uff0c\u8996\u5176\u7d93\u7d61\u6d6e\u6c88\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u9006\u5f9e\u5faa\u4e4b\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u75be\u8005\u4e0d\u75c5\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u9072\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u8108\u4e0d\u5f80\u4f86\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\uff0c\u76ae\u819a\u8457\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002 One must first know the channels and then know the pulse. One who can see the hidden channel is victorious over death. If the foot Yang Qi is blocked, the foot cannot be bent or stretched, and death will come with the eyes popping out. The Emperor asked about yin and yang in summer and winter. Taoist master Guan Ping said: The nine signs of the pulse are all deep, thin, and suspended when they are blocked, so yin dominates winter and causes death at midnight. The agitated, panting, and hot people are yang and dominate summer, causing death at noon. Therefore, cold and hot diseases are treated with dawn, hot diseases and fever are treated with noon, diseases caused by wind are treated with dusk, diseases caused by fluids are treated with midnight. The pulse is sometimes intermittent, sometimes continuous, sometimes slow, or fast. People who have these pulses will die in the four seasons. Even after the body has shed its form and flesh, if the nine signs are properly adjusted, it will still result in death. If the seven examinations are seen, but the nine signs do not follow this, they will not die. The one who speaks of not dying refers to diseases caused by wind and uterine bleeding, which resemble diseases treated by the seven examinations, but are not the same. Therefore, it is said that if there is a disease treated by the seven examinations and the nine signs have been ruined, death will certainly occur and there will be groans of anguish. One must carefully investigate the beginning of the illness and the current state of the disease, then cut according to the pulse, observe the flow and sinking of the channels, follow their rise and fall, up and down, in and out. The fast pulse is not sick, the slow pulse is sick, the pulse that does not come and go is dead, and the skin covered with blisters is dead.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u53ef\u6cbb\u8005\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u75c5\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u5b6b\u7d61\u75c5\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u5b6b\u7d61\u8840\uff0c\u8840\u75c5\u8eab\u6709\u75db\u8005\uff0c\u6cbb\u5176\u7d93\u7d61\u3002\u5176\u75c5\u8005\u5728\u5947\u90aa\uff0c\u5947\u90aa\u4e4b\u8108\u5247\u7e46\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u7559\u7626\u4e0d\u79fb\uff0c\u7bc0\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u4e0a\u5be6\u4e0b\u865b\uff0c\u5207\u800c\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u7d22\u5176\u7d50\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u523a\u51fa\u5176\u8840\uff0c\u4ee5\u898b\u901a\u4e4b\u3002\u77b3\u5b50\u9ad8\u8005\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6234\u773c\u8005\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u5df2\u7d55\uff0c\u6b64\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u8981\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u5bdf\u4e5f\u3002\u624b\u6307\u53ca\u624b\u5916\u8e1d\u4e0a\u4e94\u6307\uff0c\u7559\u937c\u3002 The emperor asked, What of one who can be governed? Zh\u00f2u B\u00f3 replied, One with illnesses of the meridians should be treated according to their meridians. One with bleeding in the sinews should be treated according to the bleeding in the sinews. For one whose body is afflicted by pain due to bleeding, treat them according to their meridians and sinews. For those who are ill in strange and abnormal ways, the strange and abnormal meridian shall be punctured. Leave the needle in place without moving it, adjust it as needed, insert the needle deeply, follow the meridian and sinew to find where they have knotted and are blocked, extract the blood by puncturing, and observe the pathway. For those with eyes that are sunken, this indicates insufficiency of the Y\u00e1ngq\u00ec, and for one who wears eyeglasses, the Y\u00e1ngq\u00ec has already ceased, which is decisive of life and death and cannot be overlooked. Among the fingers and the outer corner of the foot, insert five needles and leave them in place.</p> <p>This translation was done using an AI model trained on a dataset of 100k+ literary Chinese sentences, and post-edited by a human to ensure accuracy.

The Grand Perfecter replied, In general, people's shock, fear, and exhaustion in response to their activities all constitute changes. Thus, when practicing martial arts at night, one may gasp from the kidneys, causing kidney energy to damage the lungs. If one experiences a fall or feels afraid, one may gasp from the liver, causing liver energy to harm the spleen. When experiencing shock or fear, one may gasp from the lungs, causing liver energy to injure the heart. Falling into water or tripping may cause gasping from both the kidneys and bones, at which point, if one is courageous, their vital energy will circulate properly, but if one is timid, they will become ill. Therefore, it is said that diagnosing illness involves observing a person's courage, timidity, flesh, skin, and being able to discern their condition to prescribe treatment. Thus, when one overeats or drinks, sweat may emerge from the stomach. When shocked, one loses vital energy, causing sweat to emerge from the heart. When carrying heavy loads and walking far, sweat may emerge from the kidneys. When rushing in fear or panic, sweat may emerge from the liver. When exhausted from physical exertion, sweat may emerge from the spleen. In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the changing yin and yang of the four seasons give rise to illness, which is a constant occurrence. </p> <p>2: \u98df\u6c23\u5165\u80c3\uff0c\u6563\u7cbe\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u6deb\u6c23\u65bc\u7b4b\u3002\u6deb\u6c23\u5165\u80c3\uff0c\u6fc1\u6c23\u6b78\u5fc3\uff0c\u6deb\u7cbe\u65bc\u8108\u3002\u8108\u6c23\u6d41\u7d93\uff0c\u7d93\u6c23\u6b78\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u80ba\u671d\u767e\u8108\uff0c\u8f38\u7cbe\u65bc\u76ae\u6bdb\u3002\u6bdb\u8108\u5408\u7cbe\uff0c\u884c\u6c23\u65bc\u8151\u3002\u8151\u7cbe\u795e\u660e\uff0c\u7559\u65bc\u56db\u81df\uff0c\u6c23\u6b78\u65bc\u690e\u8861\u3002\u6b0a\u8861\u4ee5\u5e73\uff0c\u6c23\u53e3\u6210\u5bf8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\u3002\u98f2\u5165\u65bc\u80c3\uff0c\u904a\u6ea2\u7cbe\u6c23\uff0c\u4e0a\u8f38\u65bc\u813e\u3002\u813e\u6c23\u6563\u7cbe\uff0c\u4e0a\u6b78\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u901a\u8abf\u6c34\u9053\uff0c\u4e0b\u8f38\u8180\u80f1\u3002\u6c34\u7cbe\u56db\u5e03\uff0c\u4e94\u7d93\u4e26\u884c\uff0c\u5408\u65bc\u56db\u6642\u4e94\u81df\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u63c6\u5ea6\u4ee5\u70ba\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002 Food Qi enters the stomach, disperses essence in the liver, and dissipates lewd Qi in the muscles. Lewd Qi enters the stomach, turbid Qi returns to the heart, and lewd essence in the vessels. Vessel Qi circulates throughout the body, and lung Qi returns to the lungs, connecting with the hundred vessels and nourishing the skin and hair. Hair vessels join essence, regulating Qi in the liver. The liver spirit is enlightened, residing in the four organs, and Qi returns to the vertebral plexus. The vertebral plexus balances and establishes the meridians, leading to the formation of an inch of Qi, and deciding life and death. Drinking enters the stomach, circulating essence and Qi, ascending and nourishing the spleen. Spleen Qi disperses essence, rising to the lungs, regulating the waterways, and descending to nourish the bladder. Essence spreads in the five pathways, with the five organs aligning in pairs according to yin and yang, regulating with the seasons, establishing constancy.</p> <p>3: \u592a\u967d\u85cf\u7368\u81f3\uff0c\u53a5\u5598\u865b\u6c23\u9006\uff0c\u662f\u9670\u4e0d\u8db3\u967d\u6709\u9918\u4e5f\uff0c\u8868\u88cf\u7576\u4ff1\u5beb\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4fde\u3002\u967d\u660e\u85cf\u7368\u81f3\uff0c\u662f\u967d\u6c23\u91cd\u5e76\u4e5f\uff0c\u7576\u5beb\u967d\u88dc\u9670\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4fde\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u85cf\u7368\u81f3\uff0c\u662f\u53a5\u6c23\u4e5f\uff0c\u8e7b\u524d\u5352\u5927\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4fde\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u7368\u81f3\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u967d\u4e4b\u904e\u4e5f\u3002\u592a\u9670\u85cf\u640f\u8005\uff0c\u7528\u5fc3\u7701\u771f\uff0c\u4e94\u8108\u6c23\u5c11\uff0c\u80c3\u6c23\u4e0d\u5e73\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u5b9c\u6cbb\u5176\u4e0b\u4fde\uff0c\u88dc\u967d\u5beb\u9670\u3002\u4e00\u967d\u7368\u562f\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u53a5\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u56db\u8108\u722d\u5f35\uff0c\u6c23\u6b78\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u5b9c\u6cbb\u5176\u7d93\u7d61\uff0c\u5beb\u967d\u88dc\u9670\u3002\u4e00\u9670\u81f3\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u6cbb\u4e5f\uff0c\u771f\u865b\u3f93\u5fc3\uff0c\u53a5\u6c23\u7559\u8584\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u767d\u6c57\uff0c\u8abf\u98df\u548c\u85e5\uff0c\u6cbb\u5728\u4e0b\u4fde\u3002 When the sun is hidden and alone, when the breath is weak and the energy is reversed, it is because yin is insufficient and yang has excess.

It should be written to supplement yin and treat with moxa below. When the lesser yang is hidden and alone, it is the energy of the kidneys, crippled in front, large treatment with moxa below. When the lesser yang is alone, it is the deficiency of one yang. The great yin is difficult to grasp, five vessels are weak, the stomach qi is not stable, and it is the three yins.

Hua Xi answered: The flavor of salt is salty, its qi regulates the vessel and excretes sweat; the string is broken, its sound becomes weak; the wood is sealed, its leaves grow. When a person has these three things, it is called a ruined palace, poisonous drugs cannot be treated, short needles cannot be grasped, all are cutting the skin and injuring the flesh, blood qi struggle and black.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u5ff5\u5176\u75db\uff0c\u5fc3\u70ba\u4e4b\u4e82\u60d1\uff0c\u53cd\u751a\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u66f4\u4ee3\uff0c\u767e\u59d3\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b98\u8cca\uff0c\u70ba\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u4eba\u751f\u65bc\u5730\uff0c\u61f8\u547d\u65bc\u5929\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u5408\u6c23\uff0c\u547d\u4e4b\u66f0\u4eba\u3002\u4eba\u80fd\u61c9\u56db\u6642\u8005\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u70ba\u4e4b\u7236\u6bcd\uff1b\u77e5\u842c\u7269\u8005\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u5929\u5b50\u3002\u5929\u6709\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u4eba\u6709\u5341\u4e8c\u7bc0\uff1b\u5929\u6709\u5bd2\u6691\uff0c\u4eba\u6709\u865b\u5be6\u3002\u80fd\u7d93\u5929\u5730\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u5316\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u5931\u56db\u6642\uff1b\u77e5\u5341\u4e8c\u7bc0\u4e4b\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u8056\u667a\u4e0d\u80fd\u6b3a\u4e5f\uff1b\u80fd\u5b58\u516b\u52d5\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u4e94\u52dd\u66f4\u7acb\uff1b\u80fd\u9054\u865b\u5be6\u4e4b\u6578\u8005\uff0c\u7368\u51fa\u7368\u5165\uff0c\u547f\u541f\u81f3\u5fae\uff0c\u79cb\u6beb\u5728\u76ee\u3002 The emperor said: I think of my pain and my heart is in chaos, it is quite severe. His illness cannot be passed on to another, if the common people hear of this, they will consider it a disaster, what should be done? Duke Zhou replied: Man is born of earth and hangs upon heaven. When earth and heaven unite their breaths, it is called man. If a person responds to the four seasons, heaven and earth are his parents; if one knows all things, he is called the Son of Heaven. There are yin and yang in heaven, and there are ten vital points in man. There are cold and heat in heaven, and there are reality and emptiness in man. If one can harmonize with the changes of heaven and earth, then one will not miss the four seasons; if one knows the principles of the twelve points, saints cannot be deceived; if one can endure the eight changes, five victories will arise; if one can grasp the numbers of reality and emptiness, one will be unique and enter alone, sighing and murmuring in extreme weakness, like a hair left in the eye.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u751f\u6709\u5f62\uff0c\u4e0d\u96e2\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u5408\u6c23\uff0c\u5225\u70ba\u4e5d\u91ce\uff0c\u5206\u70ba\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u6708\u6709\u5c0f\u5927\uff0c\u65e5\u6709\u77ed\u9577\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4e26\u81f3\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u91cf\uff0c\u865b\u5be6\u547f\u541f\uff0c\u6562\u554f\u5176\u65b9\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6728\u5f97\u91d1\u800c\u4f10\uff0c\u706b\u5f97\u6c34\u800c\u6ec5\uff0c\u571f\u5f97\u6728\u800c\u9054\uff0c\u91d1\u5f97\u706b\u800c\u7f3a\uff0c\u6c34\u5f97\u571f\u800c\u7d55\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u76e1\u7136\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u7aed\u3002\u6545\u937c\u6709\u61f8\u5e03\u5929\u4e0b\u8005\u4e94\uff0c\u9ed4\u9996\u5171\u9918\u98df\uff0c\u83ab\u77e5\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u4e00\u66f0\u6cbb\u795e\uff0c\u4e8c\u66f0\u77e5\u990a\u8eab\uff0c\u4e09\u66f0\u77e5\u6bd2\u85e5\u70ba\u771f\uff0c\u56db\u66f0\u5236\u782d\u77f3\u5c0f\u5927\uff0c\u4e94\u66f0\u77e5\u5e9c\u85cf\u8840\u6c23\u4e4b\u8a3a\u3002\u4e94\u6cd5\u4ff1\u7acb\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u5148\u3002\u4eca\u672b\u4e16\u4e4b\u523a\u4e5f\uff0c\u865b\u8005\u5be6\u4e4b\uff0c\u6eff\u8005\u6cc4\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u773e\u5de5\u6240\u5171\u77e5\u4e5f\u3002\u82e5\u592b\u6cd5\u5929\u5247\u5730\uff0c\u96a8\u61c9\u800c\u52d5\uff0c\u548c\u4e4b\u8005\u82e5\u97ff\uff0c\u96a8\u4e4b\u8005\u82e5\u5f71\uff0c\u9053\u7121\u9b3c\u795e\uff0c\u7368\u4f86\u7368\u5f80\u3002 The emperor said: Human life has form and does not depart from yin and yang. Heaven and Earth unite their qi, divide into nine regions, and differentiate into four seasons. The moon has small and large phases, and the sun has short and long days. All things reach perfection and cannot be fully enumerated. It is like a ghost singing, daring to ask its method. Duke of Zhou said: Wood obtains metal but cuts it down; fire obtains water and extinguishes it; earth obtains wood and flourishes; metal obtains fire and lacks it; water obtains soil and ends it; all things are complete and cannot be exhausted. Therefore, among the five needles that hang from heaven to earth, there is one for the marquis of the left arch, one for the duke of the right arch, and one for the lord of the central arch - these three are not known. The first [needle] is for regulating spirits, the second is for nourishing the body, the third is for knowing real medicine from poisonous ones, the fourth is for adjusting jade stones large and small, and the fifth is for knowing the location of blood and qi flow in the palace. Each of these five methods has its own area of expertise. Today's needle practitioners imitate the ancients; they virtualize what is real and release what is full - this is all known by ordinary people. If one follows the law of heaven and earth, it moves according to its nature, resonating like an echo and following like a shadow. There are no ghosts or gods that come and go independently.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u9053\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u51e1\u523a\u4e4b\u771f\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u6cbb\u795e\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u5df2\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e5d\u5019\u5df2\u5099\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e43\u5b58\u937c\uff0c\u773e\u8108\u4e0d\u898b\uff0c\u773e\u51f6\u5f17\u805e\uff0c\u5916\u8089\u76f8\u5f97\uff0c\u7121\u4ee5\u5f62\u5148\uff0c\u53ef\u73a9\u5f80\u4f86\uff0c\u4e43\u65bd\u65bc\u4eba\u3002\u4eba\u6709\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u4e94\u865b\u52ff\u8fd1\uff0c\u4e94\u5be6\u52ff\u9060\uff0c\u81f3\u5176\u7576\u767c\uff0c\u9593\u4e0d\u5bb9\ud84c\ude87\u3002\u624b\u52d5\u82e5\u52d9\uff0c\u937c\u8000\u800c\u52fb\uff0c\u975c\u610f\u8996\u7fa9\uff0c\u89c0\u9069\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u51a5\u51a5\uff0c\u83ab\u77e5\u5176\u5f62\uff0c\u898b\u5176\u70cf\u70cf\uff0c\u898b\u5176\u7a37\u7a37\uff0c\u5f9e\u898b\u5176\u98db\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u8ab0\uff0c\u4f0f\u5982\u6a6b\u5f29\uff0c\u8d77\u5982\u767c\u6a5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u5982\u800c\u865b\uff0c\u4f55\u5982\u800c\u5be6\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u865b\u8005\u9808\u5176\u5be6\uff0c\u523a\u5be6\u8005\u9808\u5176\u865b\uff0c\u7d93\u6c23\u5df2\u81f3\uff0c\u614e\u5b88\u52ff\u5931\uff0c\u6df1\u6dfa\u5728\u5fd7\uff0c\u9060\u8fd1\u82e5\u4e00\uff0c\u5982\u81e8\u6df1\u6df5\uff0c\u624b\u5982\u63e1\u864e\uff0c\u795e\u7121\u71df\u65bc\u773e\u7269\u3002 The Emperor said: I wish to hear of its method. Guo Bo said: In regards to the true acupuncture, one must first regulate the spirit, once the five organs are established and the nine aspects are prepared, then store the needle, where there is no palpable pulse, and the danger is not heard, external flesh is obtained, but there is no form prior to this, it can be used to treat people. People have true and false [conditions], do not approach the five falses, do not avoid the five truths, when it arrives at its proper time, there is no room for doubt. Hand movements are skillful, the needle shines and circles, with a quiet mind observing justice, watching changes in suitability, this is called mysterious, unknown of its form, seeing its black and seeing its white, following seeing its flight, not knowing who it belongs to, crouching like a crossbow, standing like a firearm. The Emperor asked: How is it empty and how is it full? Guo Bo said: The needle empties what is full, and the needle fills what is empty, the channel qi has arrived, be cautious and do not miss, shallow and deep are intentions, far and near like one, standing at the brink of the abyss, the hand grasps the tiger, the spirit does not reside among the myriad things.</p>"},{"location":"26_huangdi-neijing_ba-zheng-shen-ming-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u516b\u6b63\u795e\u660e\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u7528\u937c\u4e4b\u670d\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u6cd5\u5247\u7109\uff0c\u4eca\u4f55\u6cd5\u4f55\u5247\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cd5\u5929\u5247\u5730\uff0c\u5408\u4ee5\u5929\u5149\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u51e1\u523a\u4e4b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5fc5\u5019\u65e5\u6708\u661f\u8fb0\u56db\u6642\u516b\u6b63\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u6c23\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e43\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u662f\u6545\u5929\u6eab\u65e5\u660e\uff0c\u5247\u4eba\u8840\u6dd6\u6db2\uff0c\u800c\u885b\u6c23\u6d6e\uff0c\u6545\u8840\u6613\u5beb\uff0c\u6c23\u6613\u884c\uff1b\u5929\u5bd2\u65e5\u9670\uff0c\u5247\u4eba\u8840\u51dd\u6ce3\uff0c\u800c\u885b\u6c23\u6c88\u3002\u6708\u59cb\u751f\uff0c\u5247\u8840\u6c23\u59cb\u7cbe\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u59cb\u884c\uff1b\u6708\u90ed\u6eff\uff0c\u5247\u8840\u6c23\u5be6\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u5805\uff1b\u6708\u90ed\u7a7a\uff0c\u5247\u808c\u8089\u6e1b\uff0c\u7d93\u7d61\u865b\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u53bb\uff0c\u5f62\u7368\u5c45\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u56e0\u5929\u6642\u800c\u8abf\u8840\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u5929\u5bd2\u7121\u523a\uff0c\u5929\u6eab\u7121\u7591\u3002\u6708\u751f\u7121\u5beb\uff0c\u6708\u6eff\u7121\u88dc\uff0c\u6708\u90ed\u7a7a\u7121\u6cbb\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5f97\u6642\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\u3002\u56e0\u5929\u4e4b\u5e8f\uff0c\u76db\u865b\u4e4b\u6642\uff0c\u79fb\u5149\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6b63\u7acb\u800c\u5f85\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u65e5\u6708\u751f\u800c\u5beb\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u85cf\u865b\uff1b\u6708\u6eff\u800c\u88dc\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u63da\u6ea2\uff0c\u7d61\u6709\u7559\u8840\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u91cd\u5be6\uff1b\u6708\u90ed\u7a7a\u800c\u6cbb\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u4e82\u7d93\u3002\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u932f\uff0c\u771f\u90aa\u4e0d\u5225\uff0c\u6c88\u4ee5\u7559\u6b62\uff0c\u5916\u865b\u5167\u4e82\uff0c\u6deb\u90aa\u4e43\u8d77\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked: There are rules for acupuncture treatment. What are the rules today? Master Qi replied: The rules are from heaven and earth, and combine the light of heaven. Emperor Yellow said: I wish to hear more about this. Master Qi said: All acupuncture techniques must wait for the gas of the sun, moon, stars, and four seasons. When the gas is stable, it is time for acupuncture. That's why when the weather is warm and sunny, human blood and fluids are liquid, and the defensive gas rises. It is easier to write blood and move gas; when it is cold and rainy, human blood thickens and hardens, and the defensive gas sinks. When the moon begins to grow, the blood and gas become more refined and the defensive gas starts to circulate; when the moon is full, the blood is rich, and the muscles are strong; when the moon wanes, the muscles shrink, the channels and collaterals are empty, the defensive gas disappears, and the body stands alone. Therefore, adjusting the blood and gas according to the time of day is necessary. That's why it's better not to acupuncture in cold weather, and there's no doubt about it in warm weather. Don't write when the moon is growing, don't supplement when the moon is full, and don't treat when the moon is waning. This is called adjusting according to the time. According to the order of heaven, when it is empty, treat it; when it is full, stand firmly and wait. That's why you write when the moon grows and supplement when the moon is full, hiding the emptiness; when the moon wanes, treating is called restoring the channels. In terms of yin and yang, confusion, true and false are not distinguished. Sinking to stop it leads to external emptiness and internal chaos, and disease begins with evil.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u661f\u8fb0\u516b\u6b63\u4f55\u5019\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1b\u661f\u8fb0\u8005\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5236\u65e5\u6708\u4e4b\u884c\u4e5f\u3002\u516b\u6b63\u8005\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5019\u516b\u98a8\u4e4b\u865b\u90aa\uff0c\u4ee5\u6642\u81f3\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u56db\u6642\u8005\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5206\u6625\u79cb\u51ac\u590f\u4e4b\u6c23\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u4ee5\u6642\u8abf\u4e4b\u4e5f\uff0c\u516b\u6b63\u4e4b\u865b\u90aa\uff0c\u800c\u907f\u4e4b\u52ff\u72af\u4e5f\u3002\u4ee5\u8eab\u4e4b\u865b\uff0c\u800c\u9022\u5929\u4e4b\u865b\uff0c\u5169\u865b\u76f8\u611f\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u81f3\u9aa8\uff0c\u5165\u5247\u50b7\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u5de5\u5019\u6551\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f17\u80fd\u50b7\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5fcc\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said: What is the sign of the eight nodes? The Grand Astrologer replied, The stars and constellations regulate the movement of the sun and moon. The eight nodes are used to mark the changes in the eight winds, which occur at certain times. The four seasons divide the energy of spring, autumn, winter, and summer, allowing us to adjust accordingly. By avoiding the effects of the eight nodes, we can avoid misfortune. When our physical bodies are aligned with the heavens, we must be careful not to offend heaven's virtue, as it can cause harm to the five organs. A skilled astrologer knows how to avoid such harm and says, 'Heaven's warnings should never be ignored.'</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5176\u6cd5\u661f\u8fb0\u8005\uff0c\u4f59\u805e\u4e4b\u77e3\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u6cd5\u5f80\u53e4\u8005\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1b\u6cd5\u5f80\u53e4\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u77e5\u937c\u7d93\u4e5f\u3002\u9a57\u65bc\u4f86\u4eca\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u77e5\u65e5\u4e4b\u5bd2\u6eab\uff0c\u6708\u4e4b\u865b\u76db\uff0c\u4ee5\u5019\u6c23\u4e4b\u6d6e\u6c88\uff0c\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\u65bc\u8eab\uff0c\u89c0\u5176\u7acb\u6709\u9a57\u4e5f\u3002\u89c0\u5176\u51a5\u51a5\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u5f62\u6c23\u69ae\u885b\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5f62\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u7368\u77e5\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u65e5\u4e4b\u5bd2\u6eab\uff0c\u6708\u4e4b\u865b\u76db\uff0c\u56db\u6642\u6c23\u4e4b\u6d6e\u6c88\uff0c\u53c3\u4f0d\u76f8\u5408\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u5de5\u5e38\u5148\u898b\u4e4b\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u4e0d\u5f62\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u89c0\u65bc\u51a5\u51a5\u7109\u3002\u901a\u65bc\u7121\u7aae\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u50b3\u65bc\u5f8c\u4e16\u4e5f\uff0c\u662f\u6545\u5de5\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u7570\u4e5f\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u4e0d\u5f62\u898b\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u6545\u4ff1\u4e0d\u80fd\u898b\u4e5f\u3002\u8996\u4e4b\u7121\u5f62\uff0c\u5617\u4e4b\u7121\u5473\uff0c\u6545\u8b02\u51a5\u51a5\uff0c\u82e5\u795e\u9ae3\ud863\udc70\u3002\u865b\u90aa\u8005\uff0c\u516b\u6b63\u4e4b\u865b\u90aa\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u6b63\u90aa\u8005\uff0c\u8eab\u5f62\u82e5\u7528\u529b\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u958b\uff0c\u9022\u865b\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e5f\u5fae\uff0c\u6545\u83ab\u77e5\u5176\u60c5\uff0c\u83ab\u898b\u5176\u5f62\u3002\u4e0a\u5de5\u6551\u5176\u840c\u7259\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u898b\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u76e1\u8abf\u4e0d\u6557\u800c\u6551\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u4e0a\u5de5\u3002\u4e0b\u5de5\u6551\u5176\u5df2\u6210\uff0c\u6551\u5176\u5df2\u6557\u3002\u6551\u5176\u5df2\u6210\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u4e4b\u76f8\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u75c5\u800c\u6557\u4e4b\u4e5f\uff0c\u77e5\u5176\u6240\u5728\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u8a3a\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u4e4b\u75c5\u8108\u8655\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u66f0\u5b88\u5176\u9580\u6236\u7109\uff0c\u83ab\u77e5\u5176\u60c5\u800c\u898b\u90aa\u5f62\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said: Good. The law of the stars and constellations, I have heard of. I wish to hear the ancient law of medicine. Zhi Bo said: Ancient medical law refers to the needle in the classics. Testing from past to present, the ancients observed the temperature and warmth of the sun and moon, the emptiness and fullness of the moon, and adjusted according to the qi's rising and sinking, observing its efficacy. They observed the mysterious and the formless. The shape and qi of honor and defense do not manifest externally, but they know how to manipulate it with the temperature and warmth of the sun and moon, the emptiness and fullness of the four seasons' qi, harmonizing the assistant and partner in adjusting it, and the practitioners always see it first, yet it does not manifest externally, thus they say observing the mysterious. It penetrates the endless, and can be passed down to future generations. This is why the practice is unique, but it remains formless and unseen externally, so neither can it be seen. Regarding it as formless, it has no taste, thus they call it the mysterious and the formless, like divine Yin and Yang. The empty and perverse are the eight regular qi. The righteous and perverse refer to when the body's shape and qi are exhausted, sweating, and the meridians opening, encountering empty winds, with people inside being microscopic, thus unknown of their situation and unable to see their form. Upper practitioners save the seedlings by first seeing the qi of the three departments and nine indicators, fully adjusting without defeat, then saving them. Lower practitioners save the already formed and the already defeated. Saving the already formed refers to not knowing the three departments and nine indicators' changes due to disease and causing it to deteriorate, knowing its location, diagnosing the three departments and nine indicators' illnesses and treating it. Thus they guard their doorways, unknown of the situation yet seeing the manifestation of evil.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u88dc\u5beb\uff0c\u672a\u5f97\u5176\u610f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5beb\u5fc5\u7528\u65b9\uff0c\u65b9\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c23\u65b9\u76db\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6708\u65b9\u6eff\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ee5\u65e5\u65b9\u6eab\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ee5\u8eab\u65b9\u5b9a\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ee5\u606f\u65b9\u5438\u800c\u5167\u937c\uff0c\u4e43\u5fa9\u5019\u5176\u65b9\u5438\u800c\u8f49\u937c\uff0c\u4e43\u5fa9\u5019\u5176\u65b9\u547c\u800c\u5f90\u5f15\u937c\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5beb\u5fc5\u7528\u65b9\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u800c\u884c\u7109\u3002\u88dc\u5fc5\u7528\u54e1\uff0c\u54e1\u8005\uff0c\u884c\u4e5f\uff0c\u884c\u8005\uff0c\u79fb\u4e5f\uff0c\u523a\u5fc5\u4e2d\u5176\u69ae\uff0c\u5fa9\u4ee5\u5438\u6392\u937c\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u54e1\u8207\u65b9\uff0c\u975e\u937c\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u990a\u795e\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u77e5\u5f62\u4e4b\u80a5\u7626\uff0c\u69ae\u885b\u8840\u6c23\u4e4b\u76db\u8870\u3002\u8840\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u4eba\u4e4b\u795e\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u8b39\u990a\u3002 The Emperor said: I have heard of supplementation and inscription, but I do not understand its meaning. Touba replied: Inscription must use method, method means using qi to regulate the body's method of inhalation, and then turning the needle; using the breath to gradually pull the needle, thus it is said that inscription must use method, and the energy will flow accordingly. Supplementation must use assistant, assistant means movement, movement means mobility. If the needle penetrates the honor, it is then replaced with a suction needle. Therefore, assistant and method are not needles. Therefore, nurturing the spirit requires knowing the body's state of being thin or fat, and whether one's honor guard and blood energy are flourishing or diminished. Blood energy is what makes people spiritual, and it must be carefully nurtured.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5999\u4e4e\u54c9\u8ad6\u4e5f\u3002\u5408\u4eba\u5f62\u65bc\u9670\u967d\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u865b\u5be6\u4e4b\u61c9\uff0c\u51a5\u51a5\u4e4b\u671f\uff0c\u5176\u975e\u592b\u5b50\u5b70\u80fd\u901a\u4e4b\u3002\u7136\u592b\u5b50\u6578\u8a00\u5f62\u8207\u795e\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u5f62\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u795e\uff0c\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8acb\u8a00\u5f62\uff0c\u5f62\u4e4e\u5f62\uff0c\u76ee\u51a5\u51a5\uff0c\u554f\u5176\u6240\u75c5\uff0c\u7d22\u4e4b\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u6167\u7136\u5728\u524d\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u60c5\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5f62\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u795e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8acb\u8a00\u795e\uff0c\u795e\u4e4e\u795e\uff0c\u8033\u4e0d\u805e\uff0c\u76ee\u660e\u5fc3\u958b\uff0c\u800c\u5fd7\u5148\uff0c\u6167\u7136\u7368\u609f\uff0c\u53e3\u5f17\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u4ff1\u8996\u7368\u898b\uff0c\u9069\u82e5\u660f\uff0c\u662d\u7136\u7368\u660e\uff0c\u82e5\u98a8\u5439\u96f2\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u795e\u3002\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u70ba\u4e4b\u539f\uff0c\u4e5d\u937c\u4e4b\u8ad6\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u5b58\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said: This is a wonderful discussion! The joining of yin and yang at the four seasons, the correspondence of vacuity and substance, the mysterious period, none but Confucius could explain it. However, Confucius has often spoken of form and spirit; what do you mean by form, and what do you mean by spirit? I hope to hear the explanation. Zigong said: Please explain form. Form is that which is visible as form, with eyes open one sees the mysteries, one asks about its illness, seeks it in the classics, is enlightened ahead of time, but cannot touch it and does not know its nature, so it is called form. The Emperor said: What do you mean by spirit? Zigong said: Please explain spirit. Spirit is that which is audible as spirit, with ears open one hears the mysteries, the mind is clear and open, yet the intention leads, is enlightened alone and understands independently, the mouth cannot speak it, the two [eyes and ears] see it together, but separately discern it, like the darkness of evening, manifestly bright, and like the wind blowing clouds, so it is called spirit. The Three Books and Nine Stems are its original sources; the Nine Needles' discussion does not need to exist.</p>"},{"location":"27_huangdi-neijing_li-he-zhen-xie_zh_translated/","title":"\u96e2\u5408\u771f\u90aa","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e5d\u937c\u4e5d\u7bc7\uff0c\u592b\u5b50\u4e43\u56e0\u800c\u4e5d\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e5d\u4e5d\u516b\u5341\u4e00\u7bc7\uff0c\u4f59\u76e1\u901a\u5176\u610f\u77e3\u3002\u7d93\u8a00\u6c23\u4e4b\u76db\u8870\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u50be\u79fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8abf\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5de6\u8abf\u53f3\uff0c\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u88dc\u5beb\u65bc\u69ae\u8f38\uff0c\u4f59\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\u6b64\u7686\u69ae\u885b\u4e4b\u50be\u79fb\uff0c\u865b\u5be6\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u975e\u90aa\u6c23\u5f9e\u5916\u5165\u65bc\u7d93\u4e5f\u3002\u4f59\u9858\u805e\u90aa\u6c23\u4e4b\u5728\u7d93\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u4eba\u4f55\u5982\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u8056\u4eba\u4e4b\u8d77\u5ea6\u6578\uff0c\u5fc5\u61c9\u65bc\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u6545\u5929\u6709\u5bbf\u5ea6\uff0c\u5730\u6709\u7d93\u6c34\uff0c\u4eba\u6709\u7d93\u8108\u3002\u5929\u5730\u6eab\u548c\uff0c\u5247\u7d93\u6c34\u5b89\u975c\uff1b\u5929\u5bd2\u5730\u51cd\uff0c\u5247\u7d93\u6c34\u51dd\u6ce3\uff1b\u5929\u6691\u5730\u71b1\uff0c\u5247\u7d93\u6c34\u6cb8\u6ea2\uff1b\u5352\u98a8\u66b4\u8d77\uff0c\u5247\u7d93\u6c34\u6ce2\u6d8c\u800c\u96b4\u8d77\u3002\u592b\u90aa\u4e4b\u5165\u65bc\u8108\u4e5f\uff0c\u5bd2\u5247\u8840\u51dd\u6ce3\uff0c\u6691\u5247\u6c23\u6dd6\u6fa4\uff0c\u865b\u90aa\u56e0\u800c\u5165\u5ba2\uff0c\u4ea6\u5982\u7d93\u6c34\u4e4b\u5f97\u98a8\u4e5f\uff0c\u7d93\u4e4b\u52d5\u8108\uff0c\u5176\u81f3\u4e5f\u4ea6\u6642\u96b4\u8d77\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u65bc\u8108\u4e2d\u5faa\u5faa\u7136\uff0c\u5176\u81f3\u5bf8\u53e3\u4e2d\u624b\u4e5f\uff0c\u6642\u5927\u6642\u5c0f\uff0c\u5927\u5247\u90aa\u81f3\uff0c\u5c0f\u5247\u5e73\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u7121\u5e38\u8655\uff0c\u5728\u9670\u8207\u967d\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u70ba\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u5bdf\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\uff0c\u5352\u7136\u9022\u4e4b\uff0c\u65e9\u904f\u5176\u8def\u3002\u5438\u5247\u5167\u937c\uff0c\u7121\u4ee4\u6c23\u5fe4\uff0c\u975c\u4ee5\u4e45\u7559\uff0c\u7121\u4ee4\u90aa\u5e03\uff0c\u5438\u5247\u8f49\u937c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f97\u6c23\u70ba\u6545\uff0c\u5019\u547c\u5f15\u937c\uff0c\u547c\u76e1\u4e43\u53bb\uff0c\u5927\u6c23\u7686\u51fa\uff0c\u6545\u547d\u66f0\u5beb\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u8db3\u8005\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5fc5\u5148\u636b\u800c\u5faa\u4e4b\uff0c\u5207\u800c\u6563\u4e4b\uff0c\u63a8\u800c\u6309\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f48\u800c\u6012\u4e4b\uff0c\u6293\u800c\u4e0b\u4e4b\uff0c\u901a\u800c\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u5916\u5f15\u5176\u9580\uff0c\u4ee5\u9589\u5176\u795e\uff0c\u547c\u76e1\u5167\u937c\uff0c\u975c\u4ee5\u4e45\u7559\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c23\u81f3\u70ba\u6545\uff0c\u5982\u5f85\u6240\u8cb4\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u65e5\u66ae\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4ee5\u81f3\uff0c\u9069\u800c\u81ea\u8b77\uff0c\u5019\u5438\u5f15\u937c\uff0c\u6c23\u4e0d\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u5404\u5728\u5176\u8655\uff0c\u63a8\u95d4\u5176\u9580\uff0c\u4ee4\u795e\u6c23\u5b58\uff0c\u5927\u6c23\u7559\u6b62\uff0c\u6545\u547d\u66f0\u88dc\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked: I have heard of the Nine Needles and Nine Sections. Master, you have caused them to be based on the Nine. There are ninety-nine sections, and I have thoroughly understood their meaning. The classics speak of Qi's abundance and scarcity, left and right changes, adjusting top and bottom, adjusting left and right, there is some insufficiency, supplemented in Hui Wu. I know this. All of these are the left and right changes of Hui Wei, a virtual and real origin, not external evil entering the classics. I want to hear about the evil in the classics, what kind of patient it is, and how to cure it. The Duke said: A sage person's pulse depth will correspond with heaven and earth. Thus, there are heavenly depths and terrestrial waterways; there are human meridians and blood vessels. When heaven and earth are warm and harmonious, the terrestrial waterway is calm; when heaven is cold and the earth is frozen, the terrestrial waterway solidifies; when heaven is hot and the earth is burning, the terrestrial waterway boils over; when sudden wind and storms arise, the terrestrial waterway surges and rises. When evil enters the meridian, it is cold and blood coagulates, or it is hot and Qi oozes. Vacuity and evil enter guests, just like how the terrestrial waterway gets wind. When the meridian's pulse arrives, there may be a surge, and its course within the meridians goes round and round until it reaches the Jing well point, large or small, large means evil has arrived, and small means it is stable, with an unpredictable course, between Yin and Yang, impossible to measure. From it, I will investigate the three patterns of nine indications, encountering it suddenly, and early stopping its path. When pulling, use interior needles, without letting Qi rebel, keeping still to allow it to linger, without letting evil spread. Pull and change needles to get at Qi's cause, summon and withdraw needles completely, all large Qi will come out, so the name is Jie. Emperor Yellow asked: What about supplementing? Duke Zhang said: It must first cultivate and follow it, cut and disperse it, push and press it, pluck and move it, grasp and lower it, permeate and take it, outside to close its door, calling for interior needles, keeping still to allow it to linger, using Qi's arrival as the reason, like caring for something precious, not knowing when day turns to night, its Qi will reach a state of self-defense. Call summoning and pulling needles, Qi will not come out, each in their place, push locking its door, let the spirit and Qi remain, and large Qi stays still, so the name is Supplement.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5019\u6c23\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1b\u592b\u90aa\u53bb\u7d61\u5165\u65bc\u7d93\u4e5f\uff0c\u820d\u65bc\u8840\u8108\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u5bd2\u6eab\u672a\u76f8\u5f97\uff0c\u5982\u6d8c\u6ce2\u4e4b\u8d77\u4e5f\uff0c\u6642\u4f86\u6642\u53bb\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u5e38\u5728\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u65b9\u5176\u4f86\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fc5\u6309\u800c\u6b62\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b62\u800c\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u7121\u9022\u5176\u885d\u800c\u5beb\u4e4b\u3002\u771f\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u7d93\u6c23\u4e5f\uff0c\u7d93\u6c23\u592a\u865b\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u4f86\u4e0d\u53ef\u9022\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5019\u90aa\u4e0d\u5be9\uff0c\u5927\u6c23\u5df2\u904e\uff0c\u5beb\u4e4b\u5247\u771f\u6c23\u812b\uff0c\u812b\u5247\u4e0d\u5fa9\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u5fa9\u81f3\uff0c\u800c\u75c5\u76ca\u84c4\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u8ffd\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u53ef\u6302\u4ee5\u9aee\u8005\uff0c\u5f85\u90aa\u4e4b\u81f3\u6642\u800c\u767c\u937c\u5beb\u77e3\uff0c\u82e5\u5148\u82e5\u5f8c\u8005\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u5df2\u76e1\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0b\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u77e5\u5176\u53ef\u53d6\u5982\u767c\u6a5f\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u53d6\u5982\u6263\u690e\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u77e5\u6a5f\u9053\u8005\u4e0d\u53ef\u6302\u4ee5\u9aee\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u6a5f\u8005\u6263\u4e4b\u4e0d\u767c\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u5beb\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u653b\u90aa\u4e5f\uff0c\u75be\u51fa\u4ee5\u53bb\u76db\u8840\uff0c\u800c\u5fa9\u5176\u771f\u6c23\uff0c\u6b64\u90aa\u65b0\u5ba2\uff0c\u6eb6\u6eb6\u672a\u6709\u5b9a\u8655\u4e5f\uff0c\u63a8\u4e4b\u5247\u524d\uff0c\u5f15\u4e4b\u5247\u6b62\uff0c\u9006\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u6eab\u8840\u4e5f\u3002\u523a\u51fa\u5176\u8840\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u7acb\u5df2\u3002 Emperor said: How is the timing of Qi? Obaku said, Evil enters within the canons, discarding in the blood vessels, its cold and warmth have not yet blended, like a surge wave, coming and going, therefore not always present. Therefore it says: it is coming, one must stop it, stopping it, take it, without encountering its surge, inscribing it. The true Qi is the canal Qi, the canal Qi is too empty, so it says: its arrival cannot be met, this means. Therefore it says: the timing of evil is not certain, the great Qi has passed, inscribing it will cause the true Qi to dissipate, if it dissipates there will be no return, and evil Qi will arrive again, causing the disease to accumulate further. It cannot be chased, this means. Not allowed to hang it on a hair, waiting for the arrival of evil, then inserting the needle and inscribing, whether before or after, the blood and Qi have been exhausted, the disease cannot be cured, so it says: knowing when to take it is like aiming at a target, not knowing when to take it is like attaching a peg, this means. Emperor said: What about supplementing and inscribing? Obaku said: This is an attack on evil, quickly expelling it to replenish the true Qi, this evil is new guests, without a fixed location, pushing it will make it move forward, pulling it will make it stop, reversing it and piercing it warms the blood. Piercing out its blood, the disease is cured</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u7136\u771f\u90aa\u4ee5\u5408\uff0c\u6ce2\u96b4\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u5019\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5be9\u636b\u5faa\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u4e4b\u76db\u865b\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u5bdf\u5176\u5de6\u53f3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u76f8\u5931\u53ca\u76f8\u6e1b\u8005\uff0c\u5be9\u5176\u75c5\u85cf\u4ee5\u671f\u4e4b\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e09\u90e8\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e0d\u5225\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u4e0d\u5206\u3002\u5730\u4ee5\u5019\u5730\uff0c\u5929\u4ee5\u5019\u5929\uff0c\u4eba\u4ee5\u5019\u4eba\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5e9c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e09\u90e8\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\u75c5\u8108\u4e4b\u8655\uff0c\u96d6\u6709\u5927\u904e\u4e14\u81f3\uff0c\u5de5\u4e0d\u80fd\u7981\u4e5f\u3002\u8a85\u7f70\u7121\u904e\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\uff1a\u5927\u60d1\uff0c\u53cd\u4e82\u5927\u7d93\uff0c\u771f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fa9\uff0c\u7528\u5be6\u70ba\u865b\uff0c\u4ee5\u90aa\u70ba\u771f\uff0c\u7528\u937c\u7121\u7fa9\uff0c\u53cd\u70ba\u6c23\u8cca\uff0c\u596a\u4eba\u6b63\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f9e\u70ba\u9006\uff0c\u69ae\u885b\u6563\u4e82\uff0c\u771f\u6c23\u5df2\u5931\uff0c\u90aa\u7368\u5167\u8457\uff0c\u7d55\u4eba\u9577\u547d\uff0c\u4e88\u4eba\u5929\u6b83\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e09\u90e8\u4e5d\u5019\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e45\u9577\u3002\u56e0\u4e0d\u77e5\u5408\u4e4b\u56db\u6642\u4e94\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u52a0\u76f8\u52dd\uff0c\u91cb\u90aa\u653b\u6b63\uff0c\u7d55\u4eba\u9577\u547d\u3002\u90aa\u4e4b\u65b0\u5ba2\u4f86\u4e5f\uff0c\u672a\u6709\u5b9a\u8655\uff0c\u63a8\u4e4b\u5247\u524d\uff0c\u5f15\u4e4b\u5247\u6b62\uff0c\u9022\u800c\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u7acb\u5df2\u3002 The emperor said: Good. Although the distinction between good and evil is clear, the eight trigrams do not move if circumstances are right, and I wonder what will happen next. Duke of Zhou replied: By observing the changes in the three lines within the nine phases, one can determine whether they are flourishing or declining and adjust accordingly. One should pay attention to where the energy is lost on the left, right, top, and bottom, as well as any significant shifts, and predict when the illness will resolve. Not knowing the three lines means that yin and yang are not distinct, and heaven and earth are not separate. Earth adjusts to earth, heaven adjusts to heaven, and humans adjust to humans. By defining the three lines in the center, it is said: A physician who does not know the nine phases of the illness cannot control the pulses. Punishment without error, the command says: Great confusion, reversal of the great classic, which is truly irrevocable, using reality as falsehood, using evil as truth, using needles without meaning, and becoming a thief of vital energy, depriving people of their genuine energy and following it with perversity, scattering the honor guard, losing the true vital energy, leaving only evil inside, and cutting off life expectancy, thus bringing disaster from heaven upon people. Because they do not know the three lines and nine phases, they cannot sustain longevity. Since they do not understand the harmony of the four times and the five phases, they are likely to emphasize one over the other, attack the genuine with evil, cut off life expectancy, and bring disaster upon people. The new evil comes from an unknown source; if it is pushed, it will advance, and if pulled, it will stop. Record this when you encounter it, as the illness has taken root.</p>"},{"location":"28_huangdi-neijing_tong-ping-xu-shi-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u901a\u8a55\u865b\u5be6\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u865b\u5be6\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u90aa\u6c23\u76db\u5247\u5be6\uff0c\u7cbe\u6c23\u596a\u5247\u865b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u865b\u5be6\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u865b\u8005\u80ba\u865b\u4e5f\uff0c\u6c23\u9006\u8005\u8db3\u5bd2\u4e5f\uff0c\u975e\u5176\u6642\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u7576\u5176\u6642\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u9918\u85cf\u7686\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u91cd\u5be6\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6240\u8b02\u91cd\u5be6\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u5927\u71b1\u75c5\uff0c\u6c23\u71b1\u8108\u6eff\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u91cd\u5be6\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u7d61\u4ff1\u5be6\u4f55\u5982\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u6cbb\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u7d61\u7686\u5be6\uff0c\u662f\u5bf8\u8108\u6025\u800c\u5c3a\u7de9\u4e5f\uff0c\u7686\u7576\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u6ed1\u5247\u5f9e\uff0c\u6fc7\u5247\u9006\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u865b\u5be6\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u5f9e\u5176\u7269\u985e\u59cb\uff0c\u6545\u4e94\u85cf\u9aa8\u8089\u6ed1\u5229\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9577\u4e45\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d61\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7d93\u6c23\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7d61\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7d93\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u8005\uff0c\u8108\u53e3\u71b1\u800c\u5c3a\u5bd2\u4e5f\uff0c\u79cb\u51ac\u70ba\u9006\uff0c\u6625\u590f\u70ba\u5f9e\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u865b\u7d61\u6eff\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u865b\u7d61\u6eff\u8005\uff0c\u5c3a\u71b1\u6eff\u8108\u53e3\u5bd2\u6fc7\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b64\u6625\u590f\u6b7b\u79cb\u51ac\u751f\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u6b64\u8005\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7d61\u6eff\u7d93\u865b\uff0c\u7078\u9670\u523a\u967d\uff1b\u7d93\u6eff\u7d61\u865b\uff0c\u523a\u9670\u7078\u967d\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u91cd\u865b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u6c23\u4e0a\u865b\u5c3a\u865b\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u91cd\u865b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u6cbb\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6240\u8b02\u6c23\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u7121\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u5c3a\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u884c\u6b65\u6047\u7136\u3002\u8108\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u8c61\u9670\u4e5f\u3002\u5982\u6b64\u8005\uff0c\u6ed1\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u6fc7\u5247\u6b7b\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor asked, What is the meaning of yijing (\u865a\u5be6)? Huanghuang replied, When qi is excessive, it is real; when qi is deficient, it is empty. The emperor then asked, What is the nature of yijing and shiyijing (\u5be6\u5b9f)? Huanghuang answered, The qi is empty in the lungs, and the qi is reversed in the feet, resulting in death if it occurs at the wrong time and life if it occurs at the right time. The same applies to the remaining treasures. The emperor asked, What do you mean by zhishi (\u91cd\u5be6)? Huanghuang replied, Zhishi refers to large heat diseases, where the qi is hot and the pulse is full. When the emperor asked, How are the jingai (\u7d93\u81e8) and the mai (\u7d61) treated when both are full? Huanghuang answered, When the jingai and the mai are both full, it means that the qi at the guan is urgent while the qi at the cun is slack. Therefore, it should be treated, and this is why it says: 'Slippery, follow; turbid, reverse.' The emperor then asked, What happens when the qi of the jingai is insufficient and the qi of the mai has a surplus? Huanghuang replied, When the qi in the jingai is insufficient but there is an excess of qi in the mai, it means that the pulse at the guan is hot while the pulse at the cun is cold. In autumn and winter, this causes reversal, while in spring and summer, it follows. The treatment should focus on the main disease. The emperor then asked, What happens when the jingai is empty and the mai is full? Huanghuang replied, The qi in the mai is hot and the pulse at the guan is cold and turbid, meaning that spring and summer cause death while autumn and winter cause life. What should be done to treat this condition? Huanghuang answered, When the mai is full and the jingai is empty, use cupping and acupuncture; when the mai is empty and the jingai is full, use acupuncture and cupping. The emperor asked, What do you mean by chixu (\u91cd\u865a)? Huanghuang replied, The qi is deficient in the feet, with a weak pulse at the guan, meaning that this condition is heavy. The pulse is deficient at the cun, which means there is no yin energy. This leads to death if it occurs at an inopportune time and life if it occurs at an opportune time.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5bd2\u6c23\u66b4\u4e0a\uff0c\u8108\u6eff\u800c\u5be6\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5be6\u800c\u6ed1\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u5be6\u800c\u9006\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u5be6\u6eff\uff0c\u624b\u8db3\u5bd2\uff0c\u982d\u71b1\uff0c\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u79cb\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u51ac\u590f\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u8108\u6d6e\u800c\u6fc7\uff0c\u6fc7\u800c\u8eab\u6709\u71b1\u8005\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u5f62\u76e1\u6eff\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u5f62\u76e1\u6eff\u8005\uff0c\u8108\u6025\u5927\u5805\uff0c\u5c3a\u6fc7\u800c\u4e0d\u61c9\u4e5f\uff0c\u5982\u662f\u8005\uff0c\u6545\u5f9e\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u9006\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u5f9e\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u9006\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6240\u8b02\u5f9e\u8005\uff0c\u624b\u8db3\u6eab\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u9006\u8005\uff0c\u624b\u8db3\u5bd2\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e73\u5b50\u800c\u75c5\u71b1\uff0c\u8108\u61f8\u5c0f\u8005\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u624b\u8db3\u6eab\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u5bd2\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e73\u5b50\u4e2d\u98a8\u71b1\uff0c\u5598\u9cf4\u80a9\u606f\u8005\uff0c\u8108\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5598\u9cf4\u80a9\u606f\u8005\uff0c\u8108\u5be6\u5927\u4e5f\uff0c\u7de9\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u6025\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8178\u6fbc\u4fbf\u8840\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8eab\u71b1\u5247\u6b7b\uff0c\u5bd2\u5247\u751f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8178\u6fbc\u4e0b\u767d\u6cab\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u6c88\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u8108\u6d6e\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8178\u6fbc\u4e0b\u81bf\u8840\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u61f8\u7d55\u5247\u6b7b\uff0c\u6ed1\u5927\u5247\u751f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8178\u6fbc\u4e4b\u5c6c\uff0c\u8eab\u4e0d\u71b1\uff0c\u8108\u4e0d\u61f8\u7d55\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6ed1\u5927\u8005\u66f0\u751f\uff0c\u61f8\u6fc7\u8005\u66f0\u6b7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u85cf\u671f\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7672\u75be\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u640f\u5927\u6ed1\uff0c\u4e45\u81ea\u5df2\uff1b\u8108\u5c0f\u5805\u6025\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7672\u75be\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u865b\u5be6\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u865b\u5247\u53ef\u6cbb\uff0c\u5be6\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6d88\u7649\u865b\u5be6\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u5be6\u5927\uff0c\u75c5\u4e45\u53ef\u6cbb\uff1b\u8108\u61f8\u5c0f\u5805\uff0c\u75c5\u4e45\u4e0d\u53ef\u6cbb\u3002 Emperor: The cold winds are strong, and the pulse is full and real. What does this mean? Grand Preceptor: If the pulse is slippery, it means life; if the pulse is reversed, it means death. Emperor: The pulse is full and tight, the hands and feet are cold, and the head is hot. What does this mean? Grand Preceptor: This refers to the signs of spring and autumn, which bring life, while those of winter and summer bring death. If the pulse is shallow and there is heat in the body, it means death. Emperor: What does it mean when the form is completely filled? Grand Preceptor: When the form is completely filled, the pulse is hurried, large, and tight, and the small yin does not respond properly. In such a case, following the proper path leads to life, while going against it leads to death. Emperor: What does it mean to follow the proper path and lead to life, and go against it and lead to death? Grand Preceptor: By following the proper path, I mean that the hands and feet are warm. By going against it, I mean that the hands and feet are cold. Emperor: When there is fever in infancy, and the pulse is suspended and small, what does this mean? Grand Preceptor: If the hands and feet are warm, it means life; if they are cold, it means death. Emperor: When there is wind-heat fever in infancy, with coughing, shortness of breath, and shoulder pain, what does the pulse look like? Grand Preceptor: Coughing, shortness of breath, and shoulder pain indicate a large and strong pulse, which may lead to life if treated gently, or to death if treated urgently. Emperor: What does it mean when there is blood in the intestines? Grand Preceptor: If the body is hot, it means death; if it is cold, it means life. Emperor: What does it mean when there is white discharge from the intestines? Grand Preceptor: A sinking pulse indicates life, while a floating pulse indicates death. Emperor: What does it mean when there is pus in the intestinal discharge? Grand Preceptor: A hanging and disappearing pulse means death, while a large and sliding pulse means life. Emperor: What does it mean when there is no heat in the intestines, and the pulse is not sinking and disappearing? Grand Preceptor: A large and sliding pulse indicates life, while a tight and sinking pulse indicates death, in accordance with the time of onset. Emperor: What does it mean when there is extreme haste and urgency? Grand Preceptor: The pulse is rapid and slippery, persisting by itself; the pulse is small and tight, leading to death and cannot be treated. Emperor: What does it mean when the pulse in extreme hastiness is weak or strong? Grand Preceptor: If it is weak, it can be treated; if it is strong, it means death. Emperor: What does it mean when the wasting and reality of the pulse are discussed? Grand Preceptor: The reality can be treated, while the strength leads to death.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5f62\u5ea6\u9aa8\u5ea6\u8108\u5ea6\u7b4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u77e5\u5176\u5ea6\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u4e9f\u6cbb\u7d93\u7d61\uff0c\u590f\u4e9f\u6cbb\u7d93\u4fde\uff0c\u79cb\u4e9f\u6cbb\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u51ac\u5247\u9589\u585e\u3002\u9589\u585e\u8005\uff0c\u7528\u85e5\u800c\u5c11\u937c\u77f3\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u5c11\u937c\u77f3\u8005\uff0c\u975e\u7670\u75bd\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\uff0c\u7670\u75bd\u4e0d\u5f97\u9803\u6642\u56de\u3002\u7670\u4e0d\u77e5\u6240\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u4e0d\u61c9\u624b\uff0c\u4e4d\u4f86\u4e4d\u5df2\uff0c\u523a\u624b\u592a\u9670\u508d\u4e09\u75cf\u8207\u7e93\u8108\u5404\u4e8c\u3002\u6396\u7670\u5927\u71b1\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u4e94\uff0c\u523a\u800c\u71b1\u4e0d\u6b62\uff0c\u523a\u624b\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e09\uff0c\u523a\u624b\u592a\u9670\u7d93\u7d61\u8005\u5927\u9aa8\u4e4b\u6703\u5404\u4e09\u3002\u66b4\u7670\u7b4b\u7ddb\uff0c\u96a8\u5206\u800c\u75db\uff0c\u9b44\u6c57\u4e0d\u76e1\uff0c\u80de\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6cbb\u5728\u7d93\u4fde\u3002\u8179\u66b4\u6eff\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d6\u624b\u592a\u967d\u7d93\u7d61\u8005\uff0c\u80c3\u4e4b\u52df\u4e5f\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4fde\u53bb\u810a\u690e\u4e09\u5bf8\u508d\u4e94\uff0c\u7528\u54e1\u5229\u937c\u3002\u970d\u4e82\uff0c\u523a\u4fde\u508d\u4e94\uff0c\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u53ca\u4e0a\u508d\u4e09\u3002\u523a\u7647\u9a5a\u8108\u4e94\uff0c\u937c\u624b\u592a\u9670\u5404\u4e94\uff0c\u523a\u7d93\u592a\u967d\u4e94\uff0c\u523a\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u7d93\u7d61\u508d\u8005\u4e00\uff0c\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u4e00\uff0c\u4e0a\u8e1d\u4e94\u5bf8\u523a\u4e09\u937c\u3002 The emperor said: The body can be measured in terms of bones, pulse, and sinews. How do we know the measurements? The emperor said: In spring, treat the channels and collaterals; in summer, treat the channels and tendons; in autumn, treat the six palaces; in winter, close them up. When they are closed up, treatment with medicine is preferred over bloodletting. This is what is meant by using less bloodletting: it does not refer to pimples or boils, as pimples and boils should be treated promptly. A pimple cannot be recognized, and when pressed, it does not respond appropriately. It appears and disappears suddenly, and five needles are inserted into the Taoyang channel at the hand side of the Sanjiao and Larm merge and two into the large intestine channel at the hand side of the Sanjiao and Taiyang. If there is a hot pimple on the loin, five needles are inserted into the Shao Yang channel at the foot, and if the heat does not subside, three needles are inserted into the hand Jueyin channel at the Taiyin channel where the large bones meet, each at a distance of three. When sinews become tense and painful, distribute the treatment to the channels and tendons; the soul sweat does not disperse, and the source energy is insufficient, which can be treated at the Jueyin channel. When the abdomen is distended, it cannot be pressed down, take five needles from the Taiyang channel at the abdominal gathering place, remove two inches of Shao Yin from the spine, and use an Ayush needle. Hoarseness occurs, insert five needles at the Jueyin at a distance of five, and one each into the Yangming channel at the foot and above the ankle, pressing for three needles at the fifth inch of the Achilles tendon.</p> <p>4: \u51e1\u6cbb\u6d88\u7649\u4ec6\u64ca\uff0c\u504f\u67af\u75ff\u53a5\uff0c\u6c23\u6eff\u767c\u9006\uff0c\u80a5\u8cb4\u4eba\uff0c\u5247\u9ad8\u6881\u4e4b\u75be\u4e5f\u3002\u9694\u585e\u9589\u7d55\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5247\u66b4\u6182\u4e4b\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u66b4\u53a5\u800c\u807e\uff0c\u504f\u585e\u9589\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5167\u6c23\u66b4\u8584\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u5f9e\u5167\u5916\u4e2d\u98a8\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u6545\u7626\u7559\u8457\u4e5f\u3002\u8e60\u8ddb\uff0c\u5bd2\u98a8\u6fd5\u4e4b\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9ec3\u75b8\u66b4\u75db\uff0c\u7672\u75be\u53a5\u72c2\uff0c\u4e45\u9006\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\u4e5f\u3002\u4e94\u85cf\u4e0d\u5e73\uff0c\u516d\u5e9c\u9589\u585e\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\u4e5f\u3002\u982d\u75db\u8033\u9cf4\uff0c\u4e5d\u7ac5\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u8178\u80c3\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\u4e5f\u3002 Any treatments for the condition of high lofty people such as therapy to regulate, eliminating the attack of dampness and expelling pathogens, treating the paralysis of the limbs, and restoring vital energy can relieve this condition. Isolated blockage closing off the channels, disruption of Qi flow both above and below leads to acute grief syndrome. Sudden stroke and deafness, partial obstruction or closure of the channels, internal Qi is severely deficient. Not following the principles of treating interior and exterior wind diseases, resulting in emaciation. Limping, cold, damp diseases. The Yellow Emperor said: jaundice, acute pain, blindness, madness, is caused by long-term imbalance of vital energy. Internal organs are not functioning properly, and the blockage of six divisions leads to this condition.

Huan Dynasty replied, When Yin and Yang are out of alignment, they become deficient or excessive, and reverse or follow in either the inner or outer, with differing sources, thus causing diseases to manifest differently. The Emperor asked, May I hear about these different states? Huan Dynasty said, Yang represents heavenly Qi, governing the exterior, while Yin represents earthly Qi, governing the interior. Therefore, the path of Yang is real and the path of Yin is vacuous. Thus, when one contracts wind evil, Yang is affected; when one eats unrefined food and does not regulate rest or movement, Yin is affected. When Yang is affected, it enters the six ministries, and when Yin is affected, it enters the five organs. Entering the six ministries results in fever and restlessness at night; entering the five organs leads to nausea and diarrhea, which can persist as dysentery. Therefore, the throat governs heavenly Qi, and the palate governs earthly Qi. Thus, Yang receives wind Qi, and Yin receives damp Qi. The flow of Yin Qi rises from the foot to the head and descends along the arms to the tips of the fingers; the flow of Yang Qi rises from the hand to the head and descends to the foot. Hence, it is said that in diseases of Yang, the ascent is extreme while the descent is weak, and in diseases of Yin, the descent is extreme while the ascent is weak. Therefore, when one is injured by wind, the upper part is affected first; when one is injured by dampness, the lower part is affected first</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u813e\u75c5\u800c\u56db\u652f\u4e0d\u7528\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u56db\u652f\u7686\u7a1f\u6c23\u65bc\u80c3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5f97\u81f3\u7d93\uff0c\u5fc5\u56e0\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u4e43\u5f97\u7a1f\u4e5f\u3002\u4eca\u813e\u75c5\u4e0d\u80fd\u70ba\u80c3\u884c\u5176\u6d25\u6db2\uff0c\u56db\u652f\u4e0d\u5f97\u7a1f\u6c34\u7a40\u6c23\uff0c\u6c23\u65e5\u4ee5\u8870\uff0c\u8108\u9053\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u7b4b\u9aa8\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u7686\u7121\u6c23\u4ee5\u751f\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u7528\u7109\u3002 The emperor asked, Why are the four limbs not nourished in cases of pemphigus (\u813e\u75c5), and what is the reason for this? Qi Bo replied, The four limbs all obtain qi from the stomach. If they cannot reach the meridians, it is due to a problem with the spleen. Hence, they can obtain qi. Now, in cases of pemphigus, the spleen cannot provide nourishment for the stomach, and the four limbs cannot obtain water and grain qi. The qi declines daily, the meridian channels are not beneficial, and the tendons, bones, muscles, and flesh all lack qi to generate life, so they are not used.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u813e\u4e0d\u4e3b\u6642\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u813e\u8005\u571f\u4e5f\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e2d\u592e\uff0c\u5e38\u4ee5\u56db\u6642\u9577\u56db\u85cf\uff0c\u5404\u5341\u516b\u65e5\u5bc4\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u7368\u4e3b\u65bc\u6642\u4e5f\u3002\u813e\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u5e38\u8457\u80c3\u571f\u4e4b\u7cbe\u4e5f\uff0c\u571f\u8005\uff0c\u751f\u842c\u7269\u800c\u6cd5\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u6545\u4e0a\u4e0b\u81f3\u982d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e3b\u6642\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked: Why is the spleen not in charge of the seasons?

It should not be solely responsible for managing the seasons. The spleen's function, which involves connecting with the nourishing energy of the earth, extends throughout both the upper and lower realms; thus, it should not be in charge of the seasons</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u813e\u8207\u80c3\u4ee5\u819c\u76f8\u9023\u8033\uff0c\u800c\u80fd\u70ba\u4e4b\u884c\u5176\u6d25\u6db2\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u8005\u4e09\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u8cab\u80c3\u5c6c\u813e\u7d61\u55cc\uff0c\u6545\u592a\u9670\u70ba\u4e4b\u884c\u6c23\u65bc\u4e09\u9670\u3002\u967d\u660e\u8005\uff0c\u8868\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u6d77\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ea6\u70ba\u4e4b\u884c\u6c23\u65bc\u4e09\u967d\u3002\u85cf\u5e9c\u5404\u56e0\u5176\u7d93\u800c\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u80c3\u884c\u5176\u6d25\u6db2\u3002\u56db\u652f\u4e0d\u5f97\u7a1f\u6c34\u7a40\u6c23\uff0c\u65e5\u4ee5\u76ca\u8870\uff0c\u9670\u9053\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u7b4b\u9aa8\u808c\u8089\u7121\u6c23\u4ee5\u751f\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u7528\u7109\u3002 The emperor asked: The spleen and stomach are connected by a membrane, and yet they can cause the fluids to flow. Why is this so? T\u00e1ib\u00f3 replied: The Ch\u00edyu\u00e8 channel is the three Y\u00edn channels, and its pulse connects to the stomach and belongs to the spleen's network of the L\u00edngt\u00f3ng. Thus, the Ch\u00edyue channel causes Q\u00ec to flow in the three Y\u00edn. The Y\u00e1ngm\u00edng is the exterior, and the sea of the five Z\u0101ng and six F\u01d4. It also causes Q\u00ec to flow in the three Y\u00e1ng. Each storehouse receives Q\u00ec according to its meridian from the Y\u00e1ngm\u00edng, thus causing the stomach to move the fluids. If the four limbs are not properly balanced, water and grain Q\u00ec will decrease each day, the Y\u012bn pathway will not be favorable, muscles, bones, and flesh will have no Q\u00ec to generate life, and therefore will not be used.</p>"},{"location":"2_huangdi-neijing_si-qi-diao-shen-da-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u56db\u6c23\u8abf\u795e\u5927\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u6625\u4e09\u6708\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u767c\u9673\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u4ff1\u751f\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4ee5\u69ae\uff0c\u591c\u81e5\u65e9\u8d77\uff0c\u5ee3\u6b65\u65bc\u5ead\uff0c\u88ab\u9aee\u7de9\u5f62\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5fd7\u751f\uff0c\u751f\u800c\u52ff\u6bba\uff0c\u4e88\u800c\u52ff\u596a\uff0c\u8cde\u800c\u52ff\u7f70\uff0c\u6b64\u6625\u6c23\u4e4b\u61c9\u990a\u751f\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u9006\u4e4b\u5247\u50b7\u809d\uff0c\u590f\u70ba\u5bd2\u8b8a\uff0c\u5949\u9577\u8005\u5c11\u3002\u590f\u4e09\u6708\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u8543\u79c0\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u6c23\u4ea4\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u83ef\u5be6\uff0c\u591c\u81e5\u65e9\u8d77\uff0c\u7121\u53ad\u65bc\u65e5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5fd7\u7121\u6012\uff0c\u4f7f\u83ef\u82f1\u6210\u79c0\uff0c\u4f7f\u6c23\u5f97\u6cc4\uff0c\u82e5\u6240\u611b\u5728\u5916\uff0c\u6b64\u590f\u6c23\u4e4b\u61c9\u990a\u9577\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u9006\u4e4b\u5247\u50b7\u5fc3\uff0c\u79cb\u70ba\u75ce\u7627\uff0c\u5949\u6536\u8005\u5c11\uff0c\u51ac\u81f3\u91cd\u75c5\u3002\u79cb\u4e09\u6708\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u5bb9\u5e73\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u4ee5\u6025\uff0c\u5730\u6c23\u4ee5\u660e\uff0c\u65e9\u81e5\u65e9\u8d77\uff0c\u8207\u96de\u4ff1\u8208\uff0c\u4f7f\u5fd7\u5b89\u5be7\uff0c\u4ee5\u7de9\u79cb\u5211\uff0c\u6536\u6582\u795e\u6c23\uff0c\u4f7f\u79cb\u6c23\u5e73\uff0c\u7121\u5916\u5176\u5fd7\uff0c\u4f7f\u80ba\u6c23\u6e05\uff0c\u6b64\u79cb\u6c23\u4e4b\u61c9\u990a\u6536\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\uff0c\u9006\u4e4b\u5247\u50b7\u80ba\uff0c\u51ac\u70ba\u98f1\u6cc4\uff0c\u5949\u85cf\u8005\u5c11\u3002\u51ac\u4e09\u6708\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u9589\u85cf\uff0c\u6c34\u51b0\u5730\u577c\uff0c\u7121\u64fe\u4e4e\u967d\uff0c\u65e9\u81e5\u665a\u8d77\uff0c\u5fc5\u5f85\u65e5\u5149\uff0c\u4f7f\u5fd7\u82e5\u4f0f\u82e5\u533f\uff0c\u82e5\u6709\u79c1\u610f\uff0c\u82e5\u5df2\u6709\u5f97\uff0c\u53bb\u5bd2\u5c31\u6eab\uff0c\u7121\u6cc4\u76ae\u819a\u4f7f\u6c23\u4e9f\u596a\uff0c\u6b64\u51ac\u6c23\u4e4b\u61c9\u990a\u85cf\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u9006\u4e4b\u5247\u50b7\u814e\uff0c\u6625\u70ba\u75ff\u53a5\uff0c\u5949\u751f\u8005\u5c11\u3002 In the third month of spring, this refers to sending forth Chen. Heaven and Earth are all alive, and all things flourish through honor. Sleep early and rise early, walk with leisure in the courtyard, with hair and form softened, so as to nurture ambition. Do not kill when born, do not rob what is given, and do not punish when honoring. This is the way of nourishing the qi of spring for generating life. Reverse this, and it will harm the liver.

Sleep early and rise early, not tired of the sun, nurture ambition without anger, help the flowers bloom beautifully, let the qi be released like a cherished object outside. This is the way of nourishing the qi of summer for lengthening life. Reverse this, and it will harm the heart. Summer for diseases like cholera, those who follow will be fewer. In the third month of autumn, this refers to Tongping. Heaven's qi is urgent, and Earth's qi is clear. Sleep early and rise early, along with the rooster waking up, nurture a calm mind, moderate the harshness of autumn, recover and replenish the spirit, maintain the qi of autumn in balance, without external ambition, let the lung qi be clean, this is the way of nourishing the qi of autumn for collecting. Reverse this, and it will harm the lungs. Winter for exhaustion, those who store will be fewer. In the third month of winter, this refers to closing storage. The ice water and ruined land, do not disturb the Yang, sleep early and wake up late, waiting for sunlight, nurture ambition like hiding or concealing, if there are private intentions, if there is already something obtained, let go of the cold and approach warmth, do not release the qi to cause the skin to dry out and steal the qi. This is the way of nourishing the qi of winter for storing. Reverse this, and it will harm the kidneys.

When the sun rises, the moon and stars are no longer visible; evil influences enter through the pores, the yang qi is blocked, and the earthly energy is manifest. The mists are not clear, then dew will not descend. There is confusion in traffic, and the lives of all things are not protected; without protection, there will be many dead trees. Evil qi does not disperse, winds and rains are not moderate, dew does not descend, and the millet will not grow well. The bandits' wind has arrived frequently, violent rains have occurred often, the heavens and earth do not protect their seasons, and they have lost the way of the Dao; then, the Central State will perish completely. Only the sage follows this and therefore has no strange diseases, all things are not lost, and the qi does not become exhausted. Reversing the spring qi, then the shining yang will not be born, and the liver's qi will vary internally. Reversing the summer qi, then the great yang will not grow, and the heart's qi will be hidden internally. Reversing the autumn qi, then the great yin will not shrink, and the lung's qi will become bitter and full. Reversing the winter qi, then the small yin will not hide, and the kidney's qi will sink alone. The four seasons' yin and yang are the roots of all things. Therefore, the sage nourishes yang in spring and summer, and nourishes yin in autumn and winter, following their roots, so he can harmonize with all things, sinking and floating at the door of their generation and growth. Reversing their roots is to cut off their source and destroy their true nature.</p> <p>3: \u6545\u9670\u967d\u56db\u6642\u8005\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4e4b\u7d42\u59cb\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u672c\u4e5f\uff0c\u9006\u4e4b\u5247\u707d\u5bb3\u751f\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e4b\u5247\u82db\u75be\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5f97\u9053\u3002\u9053\u8005\uff0c\u8056\u4eba\u884c\u4e4b\uff0c\u611a\u8005\u4f69\u4e4b\u3002\u5f9e\u9670\u967d\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u9006\u4e4b\u5247\u6b7b\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e4b\u5247\u6cbb\uff0c\u9006\u4e4b\u5247\u4e82\u3002\u53cd\u9806\u70ba\u9006\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5167\u683c\u3002\u662f\u6545\u8056\u4eba\u4e0d\u6cbb\u5df2\u75c5\uff0c\u6cbb\u672a\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u6cbb\u5df2\u4e82\uff0c\u6cbb\u672a\u4e82\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u75c5\u5df2\u6210\u800c\u5f8c\u85e5\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e82\u5df2\u6210\u800c\u5f8c\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u8b6c\u7336\u6e34\u800c\u7a7f\u4e95\uff0c\u9b2d\u800c\u9444\u9310\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ea6\u665a\u4e4e\u3002 One who knows the yin and yang of the four seasons is the beginning and end of all things, the root of life and death. Reversing it brings calamity, following it brings harsh punishment that does not arise, so it is called attaining the Way. The Way is what sages practice, while fools wear it on their person. Following yin and yang brings life, reversing it brings death, following it brings order, reversing it brings chaos. Reversed is called inner potentiality. Therefore, sages do not treat after a disease has already formed, nor treat before one has yet to form; they do not bring order after chaos has already formed, nor treat before chaos has yet to form. This is what we mean. To cure after the illness has become established is like drawing water when thirsty, or forging a spear while under attack--is it not too late?</p>"},{"location":"30_huangdi-neijing_yang-ming-mai-jie_zh_translated/","title":"\u967d\u660e\u8108\u89e3","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u75c5\uff0c\u60e1\u4eba\u8207\u706b\uff0c\u805e\u6728\u97f3\u5247\u60d5\u7136\u800c\u9a5a\uff0c\u9418\u9f13\u4e0d\u70ba\u52d5\uff0c\u805e\u6728\u97f3\u800c\u9a5a\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6545\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u660e\u8005\u80c3\u8108\u4e5f\uff0c\u80c3\u8005\uff0c\u571f\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u805e\u6728\u97f3\u800c\u9a5a\u8005\uff0c\u571f\u60e1\u6728\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5176\u60e1\u706b\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u660e\u4e3b\u8089\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u8840\u6c23\u76db\uff0c\u90aa\u5ba2\u4e4b\u5247\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u751a\u5247\u60e1\u706b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u60e1\u4eba\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u660e\u53a5\u5247\u5598\u800c\u60cb\uff0c\u60cb\u5247\u60e1\u4eba\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6216\u5598\u800c\u6b7b\u8005\uff0c\u6216\u5598\u800c\u751f\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53a5\u9006\u9023\u85cf\u5247\u6b7b\uff0c\u9023\u7d93\u5247\u751f\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: The Yangming pulse, when sick, is bad for people and fire. Hearing wood sound, feeling startled and frightened, bells and drums do not move, hearing wood sound while frightened, why is that? I want to hear the reason. Huangdi answered: Yangming is the Stomach meridian, the Stomach is Earth, so hearing the wood sound and being frightened is because Earth is bad for Wood. Emperor said: What is bad fire? Huangdi said: The Yangming governs the flesh, with the meridian blood and qi abundant, if a demonic pathogen enters then it will be hot, and if it becomes too hot, it is bad for fire. Emperor said: What is bad people? Huangdi said: When Yangming is deficient, there is panting and gasping, and gasping is bad for people. Emperor asked: If someone pants and dies or pants and lives, why is that? Huangdi answered: If the deficiency and excess are combined, then it will die, and if they are coordinated, then it will live.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u75c5\u751a\u5247\u68c4\u8863\u800c\u8d70\uff0c\u767b\u9ad8\u800c\u6b4c\uff0c\u6216\u81f3\u4e0d\u98df\u6578\u65e5\uff0c\u8e30\u57a3\u4e0a\u5c4b\uff0c\u6240\u4e0a\u4e4b\u8655\uff0c\u7686\u975e\u5176\u7d20\u6240\u80fd\u4e5f\uff0c\u75c5\u53cd\u80fd\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u56db\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u8af8\u967d\u4e4b\u672c\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u76db\u5247\u56db\u652f\u5be6\uff0c\u5be6\u5247\u80fd\u767b\u9ad8\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u68c4\u8863\u800c\u8d70\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u71b1\u76db\u65bc\u8eab\uff0c\u6545\u68c4\u8863\u6b32\u8d70\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u5984\u8a00\u7f75\u8a48\u4e0d\u907f\u89aa\u8e08\u800c\u6b4c\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u76db\u5247\u4f7f\u4eba\u5984\u8a00\u7f75\u8a48\u4e0d\u907f\u89aa\u8e08\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u6b32\u98df\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u98df\uff0c\u6545\u5984\u8d70\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said: Good. When the illness is severe, one abandons clothing and runs, climbs high and sings, or may not eat for several days, jumping over walls to enter a house - all of which are beyond one's previous abilities. How can someone who is ill be capable of such actions? Master Qi said: The four limbs are the origin of Yang energy. When Yang is strong, the four limbs are real, and thus able to climb high. The Emperor said: What about those who abandon clothing and run? Master Qi said: The heat is intense within the body, causing one to abandon clothing and want to run. The Emperor said: What about those who speak nonsense, curse, do not avoid their parents, and sing while doing so? Master Qi said: When Yang energy is strong, it causes a person to speak nonsense, curse, and not avoid their parents, and thus not want to eat, not want to eat, and therefore walk aimlessly.</p>"},{"location":"31_huangdi-neijing_re-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u71b1\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4eca\u592b\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u50b7\u5bd2\u4e4b\u985e\u4e5f\uff0c\u6216\u6108\u6216\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u6b7b\u7686\u4ee5\u516d\u4e03\u65e5\u4e4b\u9592\uff0c\u5176\u6108\u7686\u4ee5\u5341\u65e5\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u89e3\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6545\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u5de8\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u8af8\u967d\u4e4b\u5c6c\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u9023\u65bc\u98a8\u5e9c\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u8af8\u967d\u4e3b\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u4eba\u4e4b\u50b7\u65bc\u5bd2\u4e5f\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u75c5\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u96d6\u751a\u4e0d\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u5169\u611f\u65bc\u5bd2\u800c\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u4e0d\u514d\u65bc\u6b7b\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked, saying: Today, all cases of fever are due to damage from cold. Some recover and some die. Those who die usually do so within six or seven days, and those who recover usually take more than ten days. I don't know the reason for this. I would like to hear its cause. The Duke said: The Greater Yang is one of the sons of Yang. Its pulse connects with the Palace of Winds, hence it is the chief of Yang Qi (Vital Energy) in the body. When a person is injured by cold, they become sick with fever. Although the fever may be severe and not lead to death immediately, those who are affected by both cold and heat will inevitably face death.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u72c0\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u50b7\u5bd2\u4e00\u65e5\uff0c\u5de8\u967d\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u982d\u9805\u75db\u8170\u810a\u5f37\u3002\u4e8c\u65e5\u967d\u660e\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u4e3b\u8089\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u4fe0\u9f3b\u7d61\u65bc\u76ee\uff0c\u6545\u8eab\u71b1\u76ee\u75bc\u800c\u9f3b\u4e7e\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u81e5\u4e5f\u3002\u4e09\u65e5\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u4e3b\u81bd\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u5faa\u8107\u7d61\u65bc\u8033\uff0c\u6545\u80f8\u8107\u75db\u800c\u8033\u807e\u3002\u4e09\u967d\u7d93\u7d61\u7686\u53d7\u5176\u75c5\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u5165\u65bc\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u6545\u53ef\u6c57\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u56db\u65e5\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u8108\u5e03\u80c3\u4e2d\u7d61\u65bc\u55cc\uff0c\u6545\u8179\u6eff\u800c\u55cc\u4e7e\u3002\u4e94\u65e5\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u8108\u8cab\u814e\u7d61\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u7e6b\u820c\u672c\uff0c\u6545\u53e3\u71e5\u820c\u4e7e\u800c\u6e34\u3002\u516d\u65e5\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u8108\u5faa\u9670\u5668\u800c\u7d61\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u6545\u7169\u6eff\u800c\u56ca\u7e2e\u3002\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u7686\u53d7\u75c5\uff0c\u69ae\u885b\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5247\u6b7b\u77e3\u3002 The Emperor said: I wish to hear about his condition.

On the second day, Y\u00e1ngm\u00edng attacked it, and Y\u00e1ngm\u00edng governs the flesh. His pulse is at the tip of his nose and goes to his eyes, so he has fever in his body and eye pain, and his nose is dry, and he cannot lie down. On the third day, Sh\u00e0oy\u00e1ng attacked him, and Sh\u00e0oy\u00e1ng governs the liver. His pulse runs along his ribs and goes to his ears, so he has pain in his chest and back and his ears are deafened. All three Y\u00e1ng meridians were affected by his illness but had not yet entered the viscera, so it stopped at the emperor. On the fourth day, T\u00e0iy\u012bn attacked him, and T\u00e0iy\u012bn's pulse spreads in the stomach cavity and goes to the lips, so he is bloated and his lips are dry. On the fifth day, Sh\u00e0oy\u012bn attacked him, and Sh\u00e0oy\u012bn's pulse penetrates the kidneys and goes to the lungs, attaching to the tongue's root, so his mouth is parched, and his tongue is dry, and he is thirsty. On the sixth day, J\u016bny\u00e1ng attacked him, and J\u016bny\u00e1ng's pulse circulates around the y\u012bn organs and goes to the liver, so he is bothered and his swelling. All three Y\u00e1ng and Sh\u00e0o Y\u00e1ng, the five viscera and six ministries, were affected by the illness, and the honor guard did not move, and the five viscera could not communicate, so he would die.</p> <p>3: \u5176\u4e0d\u5169\u611f\u65bc\u5bd2\u8005\uff0c\u4e03\u65e5\u5de8\u967d\u75c5\u8870\uff0c\u982d\u75db\u5c11\u6108\uff1b\u516b\u65e5\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u75c5\u8870\uff0c\u8eab\u71b1\u5c11\u6108\uff1b\u4e5d\u65e5\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u75c5\u8870\uff0c\u8033\u807e\u5fae\u805e\uff1b\u5341\u65e5\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u75c5\u8870\uff0c\u8179\u6e1b\u5982\u6545\uff0c\u5247\u601d\u98f2\u98df\uff1b\u5341\u4e00\u65e5\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u75c5\u8870\uff0c\u6e34\u6b62\u4e0d\u6eff\uff0c\u820c\u4e7e\u5df2\u800c\u568f\uff1b\u5341\u4e8c\u65e5\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u75c5\u8870\uff0c\u56ca\u7e31\u5c11\u8179\u5fae\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u6c23\u7686\u53bb\uff0c\u75c5\u65e5\u5df2\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u5404\u901a\u5176\u85cf\u8108\uff0c\u75c5\u65e5\u8870\u5df2\u77e3\u3002\u5176\u672a\u6eff\u4e09\u65e5\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u6c57\u800c\u5df2\uff1b\u5176\u6eff\u4e09\u65e5\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u6cc4\u800c\u5df2\u3002 The person experiencing the symptoms would experience a gradual improvement in their condition. On the seventh day, they would have a high fever due to Jupiter disease and experience headaches that would improve over time.

The emperor asked how to treat this disease, and the Duke said that one should treat it by addressing the individual's specific ailment and by attending to their vital energy.

What is the reason for this? Duke Huan replied: Among the remnants, those who have a severe fever and force themselves to eat will experience remnants. If someone in this category, they are already weak from the illness, but their fever still lingers due to the weakness of their vital energy. The hot and cold energies combine, resulting in remnants.

How should the pulse correspond to their illness condition? Qi Bo said: A patient with two feelings of coldness, if sick for one day, both Greater Yang and Lesser Yang are affected, resulting in headache and dry mouth; if sick for two days, both Conception Vessel and Governor Vessel are affected, leading to abdominal distension and body heat, without appetite or desire to speak; if sick for three days, both Minor Yang and Major Yin are affected, resulting in deafness, swelling of the cheeks, and difficulty swallowing, with saliva not entering, unable to recognize people, and dying on the sixth day. Emperor said: The Five Organs are injured, the Six Offices are not connected, and the Royal Guards cannot function. How can one die in three days? Qi Bo said: Yang Ming is the long channel among the twelve meridians. Its qi and blood are abundant, so the patient does not recognize people. On the third day, all of their qi is depleted, resulting in death. For any illness caused by cold damage that becomes warm, the peak heat of early summer represents the warmth phase, while the peak heat of late summer represents the heat phase. Sweating should be allowed during both phases and should not be stopped</p>"},{"location":"32_huangdi-neijing_ci-re_zh_translated/","title":"\u523a\u71b1","text":"<p>1: \u809d\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5c0f\u4fbf\u5148\u9ec3\uff0c\u8179\u75db\u591a\u81e5\u8eab\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u722d\uff0c\u5247\u72c2\u8a00\u53ca\u9a5a\uff0c\u8107\u6eff\u75db\uff0c\u624b\u8db3\u8e81\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u5b89\u81e5\uff0c\u5e9a\u8f9b\u751a\uff0c\u7532\u4e59\u5927\u6c57\uff0c\u6c23\u9006\u5247\u5e9a\u8f9b\u6b7b\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u5176\u9006\u5247\u982d\u75db\u54e1\u54e1\uff0c\u8108\u5f15\u885d\u982d\u4e5f\u3002\u5fc3\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u4e0d\u6a02\uff0c\u6578\u65e5\u4e43\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u722d\u5247\u5352\u5fc3\u75db\uff0c\u7169\u60b6\u5584\u5614\uff0c\u982d\u75db\u9762\u8d64\u7121\u6c57\uff0c\u58ec\u7678\u751a\uff0c\u4e19\u4e01\u5927\u6c57\uff0c\u6c23\u9006\u5247\u58ec\u7678\u6b7b\uff0c\u523a\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u592a\u967d\u3002\u813e\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u982d\u91cd\u9830\u75db\uff0c\u7169\u5fc3\u984f\u9752\uff0c\u6b32\u5614\u8eab\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u722d\u5247\u8170\u75db\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u4fdb\u4ef0\uff0c\u8179\u6eff\u6cc4\uff0c\u5169\u9837\u75db\uff0c\u7532\u4e59\u751a\uff0c\u620a\u5df1\u5927\u6c57\uff0c\u6c23\u9006\u5247\u7532\u4e59\u6b7b\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u967d\u660e\u3002\u80ba\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u6dc5\u7136\u53a5\uff0c\u8d77\u6beb\u6bdb\u60e1\u98a8\u5bd2\uff0c\u820c\u4e0a\u9ec3\u8eab\u71b1\u3002\u71b1\u722d\uff0c\u5247\u5598\u6b2c\uff0c\u75db\u8d70\u80f8\u81ba\u80cc\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u5927\u606f\uff0c\u982d\u75db\u4e0d\u582a\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\u800c\u5bd2\uff0c\u4e19\u4e01\u751a\uff0c\u5e9a\u8f9b\u5927\u6c57\uff0c\u6c23\u9006\u5247\u4e19\u4e01\u6b7b\uff0c\u523a\u624b\u592a\u9670\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u51fa\u8840\u5982\u5927\u8c46\uff0c\u7acb\u5df2\u3002\u814e\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u8170\u75db\u4bd2\u75e0\uff0c\u82e6\u6e34\u6578\u98f2\uff0c\u8eab\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u722d\uff0c\u5247\u9805\u75db\u800c\u5f37\uff0c\u4bd2\u5bd2\u4e14\u75e0\uff0c\u8db3\u4e0b\u71b1\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u8a00\uff0c\u5176\u9006\uff0c\u5247\u9805\u75db\u54e1\u54e1\u6fb9\u6fb9\u7136\uff0c\u620a\u5df1\u751a\uff0c\u58ec\u7678\u5927\u6c57\uff0c\u6c23\u9006\u5247\u620a\u5df1\u6b7b\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u8af8\u6c57\u8005\uff0c\u81f3\u5176\u6240\u52dd\u65e5\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\u4e5f\u3002\u809d\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5de6\u9830\u5148\u8d64\uff0c\u5fc3\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u984f\u5148\u8d64\uff0c\u813e\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u9f3b\u5148\u8d64\uff0c\u80ba\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u53f3\u9830\u5148\u8d64\uff0c\u814e\u71b1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u9824\u5148\u8d64\uff0c\u75c5\u96d6\u672a\u767c\uff0c\u898b\u8d64\u8272\u8005\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u6cbb\u672a\u75c5\u3002\u71b1\u75c5\u5f9e\u90e8\u6240\u8d77\u8005\uff0c\u81f3\u671f\u800c\u5df2\uff1b\u5176\u523a\u4e4b\u53cd\u8005\uff0c\u4e09\u5468\u800c\u5df2\uff1b\u91cd\u9006\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u8af8\u7576\u6c57\u8005\uff0c\u81f3\u5176\u6240\u52dd\u65e5\uff0c\u6c57\u5927\u51fa\u4e5f\u3002\u8af8\u6cbb\u71b1\u75c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u98f2\u4e4b\u5bd2\u6c34\uff0c\u4e43\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u5fc5\u5bd2\u8863\u4e4b\uff0c\u5c45\u6b62\u5bd2\u8655\uff0c\u8eab\u5bd2\u800c\u6b62\u4e5f\u3002 Patients with hepatic fever have yellow urine first, abdominal pain with much lying down, body heat and restlessness leading to madness and strange speech, pain in the flank, restless hands and feet, and difficulty in resting.

Qi Bo replied: The name of this disease is yin-yang intersection, and intersection means death. Emperor said: I wish to hear your explanation. Qi Bo said: Sweat comes from grain, grain comes from essence. Now, pathogenic qi is struggling in the bones and flesh, causing sweat to appear, which means that the pathogenic factor has overcome the essence. If the essence wins, one will be able to eat without fever again. But if there is fever again, it means that the pathogenic factor has overcome, one cannot eat and is near death. It is said in the theory of fevers: Sweating and a full and rapid pulse indicates a dangerous situation. In this case, the pulse is not responding to the sweat, meaning it does not overcome the disease, so death is inevitable. If one is speaking madly, it means they have lost their mind, and losing one's mind leads to death.

Hui Bao replied: The illness from laboring in the wind is located below the lungs, causing people to become short of breath and have a strong desire to look up at ghosts. They also produce saliva like tears, and the cold wind causes them to shiver. This is the disease caused by laboring in the wind. The Emperor asked: How do you treat it? Hui Bao replied: Use the method of raising the head slightly. Those who are strong can do it for three days, middle-aged people for five days, and those who are not strong should do it for seven days. When they spit out green and yellow saliva, their condition will be like a boil, as large as a thrown pulse, and it will come out of the mouth like a nosebleed.

It would be better not to acupuncture. Qi Bo said: Vacuity should not be acupunctured, but if it has to be acupunctured, by the fifth day, the qi will definitely arrive. Emperor asked: What will happen when it arrives? Qi Bo said: When it arrives, the patient will have a deficiency of qi and fever, fever starts from the back and gradually moves towards the head, sweating, palms become hot, mouth becomes dry and thirsty, urine is yellow, eyes are swollen, there is a sound in the abdomen, the body feels heavy and difficult to move, menstruation does not come, the patient is irritable and cannot eat. This disease is called wind water, and it belongs to acupuncture treatment. Emperor said: I wish to hear your explanation. Qi Bo said: The pathogenic qi gathers, and its qi must be deficient, and if yin is deficient, yang will attack, so there is a deficiency of qi and fever with sweating. Yellow urine means that there is heat in the lower abdomen. Not being able to lie down properly means that the stomach is not harmonious. When lying down, the hiccups become more severe, which means that the lung is being pressed. All water-related symptoms are first seen as swelling below the eyes. Emperor asked: How do you know? Qi Bo said: Water is yin, and the area below the eyes is also yin. The lower abdomen is where yin resides, so when there is water in the lower abdomen, it causes swelling below the eyes. True qi rises upwards, causing the mouth to be dry and the tongue to be parched, making it difficult to lie down, and when lying down, hiccups bring out clear water. All water-related diseases cause difficulty in lying down, which leads to hiccups becoming more severe. A sound in the abdomen indicates that the disease is located in the stomach. The spleen is weak, causing irritability and not being able to eat. Difficulty in walking and carrying a heavy body are due to kidney qi in the foot. Menstruation does not come because the uterine vessel is closed. The uterine vessel belongs to the heart and is connected to the uterus, so today the qi rises and presses the lung, preventing heart qi from flowing down and causing menstruation to not come.

It stops when victorious, and when encountering wind, it feels like needling and fire.

Yet they do not freeze with shivering; what disease is this? Huang Di answered: In humans, the kidney essence is strong, dealing with water affairs, the Yang essence declines, the kidney marrow is dry and does not grow, one water cannot win over two fires. The kidney is water, and it is born in the bone; if the kidney does not exist, then the marrow cannot be full, causing great cold to the bone. Therefore, because they do not freeze with shivering, it is due to the one Yang of the liver and the two Yangs of the heart, and the lonely storage of the kidney. One water cannot win over two fires, so they do not freeze with shivering. This disease is called bone rigidity; it is a condition for humans.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e4b\u8089\u82db\u8005\uff0c\u96d6\u8fd1\u8863\u7d6e\uff0c\u7336\u5c1a\u82db\u4e5f\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u4f55\u75be\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u69ae\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u5be6\u4e5f\uff0c\u69ae\u6c23\u865b\u5247\u4e0d\u4ec1\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u865b\u5247\u4e0d\u7528\uff0c\u69ae\u885b\u4ff1\u865b\uff0c\u5247\u4e0d\u4ec1\u4e14\u4e0d\u7528\uff0c\u8089\u5982\u6545\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eba\u8eab\u8207\u5fd7\u4e0d\u76f8\u6709\uff0c\u66f0\u6b7b\u3002 The emperor said: People's flesh is weak, even if they are close to clothing, it is still weak.

What are the reasons for all of these, and I wish to hear their explanations. The Duke of Shou said: Those who cannot lie down and breathe with sound are due to the reverse of yangming, which controls the lower three yang meridians that are now flowing in the opposite direction, thus causing the breathing sounds. Yangming refers to the stomach channel, the stomach is the sea of the six ministers, and its qi also flows downward. When yangming reverses and cannot follow its path, it cannot lie down. The Classic of Internal Medicine says: If the stomach is not harmonious, one will not be able to rest comfortably, referring to this situation. Those who rise and walk as usual but breathe with sound are due to the reverse of lung meridian channels. Lung channel Qi cannot follow the path of the meridians, causing qi to accumulate but not move, making those who have a slight disturbance in their lung channel breathe with sound while rising and walking as usual. Those who pant even when lying down are due to an intruding water qi. Water follows the channels of rivers and fluids, and the kidney stores water, controls fluids, and is responsible for sleeping and panting.

Hua-Bo replied: Measles begins from an initial outbreak, starting from the hair follicle. It spreads or shrinks depending on the situation, one feels cold all over, the back and waist hurt, and once the cold leaves, both inside and out become hot, headaches feel like they are cracking open, and one thirsts for cold drinks. Emperor Ask: What Qi causes this? I wish to hear of its pathway. Hua-Bo said: The Yin and Yang are in conflict above and below, creating emptiness and reality, causing the Yin and Yang to move. When Yang is dominant over Yin, there is real Yin and empty Yang, and when Yang is empty, this leads to chills and trembling. If Great Yang is empty, it causes pain in the back, neck, head, and shoulders; if all three Yang are empty, then Yin Qi prevails, and since Yin Qi prevails, the bones feel cold and painful; when heat is internalized, this leads to both inside and out being hot, causing shortness of breath and thirst; thus desiring cool drinks. All of these are acquired summer damages from heat, with excess heat trapped within the skin's depths, beyond the intestines and stomach, this is where the dispersed Qi resides. This makes one sweat profusely, perspiration glands open, allowing for autumn Qi to enter, sweating encounters wind, and by bathing with water, the Water Qi settles within the skin's depths, alongside the Defensive Qi. The Defensive Qi travels throughout the day in Yang and at night in Yin, this Qi receives Yang and exits outward, receives Yin and resides within, causing internal and external to be weak, thus it occurs daily</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u9593\u65e5\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6c23\u4e4b\u820d\u6df1\uff0c\u5167\u8584\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u7368\u767c\uff0c\u9670\u90aa\u5167\u8457\uff0c\u9670\u8207\u967d\u722d\u4e0d\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u9593\u65e5\u800c\u4f5c\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5176\u4f5c\u65e5\u664f\u8207\u5176\u65e5\u65e9\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u90aa\u6c23\u5ba2\u65bc\u98a8\u5e9c\uff0c\u5faa\u8182\u800c\u4e0b\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u4e00\u65e5\u4e00\u591c\u5927\u6703\u65bc\u98a8\u5e9c\uff0c\u5176\u660e\u65e5\u65e5\u4e0b\u4e00\u7bc0\uff0c\u6545\u5176\u4f5c\u4e5f\u664f\uff0c\u6b64\u5148\u5ba2\u65bc\u810a\u80cc\u4e5f\uff0c\u6bcf\u81f3\u65bc\u98a8\u5e9c\u5247\u8160\u7406\u958b\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u958b\u5247\u90aa\u6c23\u5165\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u5165\u5247\u75c5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u65e5\u4f5c\u7a0d\u76ca\u664f\u4e5f\u3002\u5176\u51fa\u65bc\u98a8\u5e9c\uff0c\u65e5\u4e0b\u4e00\u7bc0\uff0c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u65e5\u4e0b\u81f3\u9ab6\u9aa8\uff0c\u4e8c\u5341\u516d\u65e5\u5165\u65bc\u810a\u5167\uff0c\u6ce8\u65bc\u4f0f\u8182\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e0a\u884c\uff0c\u4e5d\u65e5\u51fa\u65bc\u7f3a\u76c6\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u65e5\u9ad8\uff0c\u6545\u4f5c\u65e5\u76ca\u65e9\u4e5f\u3002\u5176\u9593\u65e5\u767c\u8005\uff0c\u7531\u90aa\u6c23\u5167\u8584\u65bc\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u6a6b\u9023\u52df\u539f\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u9053\u9060\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u6df1\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u9072\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u8207\u885b\u6c23\u4ff1\u884c\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u7686\u51fa\uff0c\u6545\u9593\u65e5\u4e43\u4f5c\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor said: Who is the one that makes it day by day? Hui Bo said: Its Qi is released deeply, its Yin is thin inside, Yang-Qi is emitted alone, Yin evil is retained inside, Yin and Yang compete not being able to come out, thus making it day by day. Emperor said: Good. What Qi makes the day wane when it becomes day? Hui Bo said: Evil Qi resides in the lungs, circulating downwards, defensive Qi gathers daily and nightly in the lungs, on the following day it goes down a node, thus making it dayless. This evil residing at the spine, every time arriving at the lungs the network will open, the network opens then evil Qi enters, evil Qi entering then disease arises, and this daylessness makes it more waning. When it comes out of the lungs, going down a node on the following day, 25 nodes down to the vertebrae, 26 nodes entering the spine, connecting at the hiding tendon's meridian, its Qi rises upwards, 9 days later coming out from the huiyin, its Qi is high and makes it day more early. When there is an interval day, it is due to evil Qi being thin in the five organs, connecting the source origin. Its way is distant, its Qi is deep, its movement is slow, not able to join with defensive Qi, not being able to all come out, thus making an interval day.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u885b\u6c23\u6bcf\u81f3\u65bc\u98a8\u5e9c\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u4e43\u767c\uff0c\u767c\u5247\u90aa\u6c23\u5165\uff0c\u5165\u5247\u75c5\u4f5c\u3002\u4eca\u885b\u6c23\u65e5\u4e0b\u4e00\u7bc0\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e4b\u767c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u7576\u98a8\u5e9c\uff0c\u5176\u65e5\u4f5c\u8005\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u90aa\u6c23\u5ba2\u65bc\u982d\u9805\u5faa\u8182\u800c\u4e0b\u8005\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u865b\u5be6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u90aa\u4e2d\u7570\u6240\uff0c\u5247\u4e0d\u5f97\u7576\u5176\u98a8\u5e9c\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u90aa\u4e2d\u65bc\u982d\u9805\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u81f3\u982d\u9805\u800c\u75c5\uff1b\u4e2d\u65bc\u80cc\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u81f3\u80cc\u800c\u75c5\uff1b\u4e2d\u65bc\u8170\u810a\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u81f3\u8170\u810a\u800c\u75c5\uff1b\u4e2d\u65bc\u624b\u8db3\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u81f3\u624b\u8db3\u800c\u75c5\u3002\u885b\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u8207\u90aa\u6c23\u76f8\u5408\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u4f5c\u3002\u6545\u98a8\u7121\u5e38\u5e9c\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u767c\uff0c\u5fc5\u958b\u5176\u8160\u7406\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u5408\uff0c\u5247\u5176\u5e9c\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 The Emperor said: Confucius said that guardian Qi is always at the doors of the Temple of Winds, and when it sends out its breath, evil Qi enters. If evil Qi enters, then one will fall ill. Now guardian Qi is sinking one step each day. How could this be? Duke Mu replied: This evil Qi resides in the head and neck, circulates through the tendons, and descends. Hence its manifestations are different, and it cannot be approached at its residence. Therefore, when evil Qi resides in the head and neck, guardian Qi accumulates at the head and one falls ill; when it resides in the back, guardian Qi accumulates at the back and one falls ill; when it resides in the waist and spine, guardian Qi accumulates at the waist and spine and one falls ill; when it resides in the hands and feet, guardian Qi accumulates at the hands and feet and one falls ill. When guardian Qi and evil Qi converge, then one falls ill. Therefore, the Temple of Winds has no constant abode, as guardian Qi's place of emission must open its orifices, and the place where evil Qi resides is its residence.

Master Qi said: Wind energy stays in its place, which is why it is always present; measles energy enters the meridians and channels and then sinks internally, which is why defensive energy is mobilized. The Emperor asked: Why do measles first start with cold and then become hot? Master Qi replied: In summer, one gets injured from intense heat, causing excessive sweating and the pores opening widely; encountering the dry and cold summer energy in the body's water, it becomes trapped within the pores and skin. In autumn, one gets injured by wind, so the illness is complete. The cold is yin energy, and wind is yang energy; being injured first by cold and then by wind, this is why it starts as cold and then becomes hot. The Emperor asked: What about when it first becomes hot and then cold? Master Qi replied: This is being injured first by wind and then by cold, which is why it first becomes hot and then cold; it arises at its own time, and is called warm measles. When there is only heat but no cold, yin energy is deficient and yang energy emerges, causing restlessness and irritability, with the hands and feet becoming hot and feeling like vomiting; this is called acute measles.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u7d93\u8a00\u6709\u9918\u8005\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u8005\u88dc\u4e4b\u3002\u4eca\u71b1\u70ba\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u5bd2\u70ba\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u592b\u7627\u8005\u4e4b\u5bd2\uff0c\u6e6f\u706b\u4e0d\u80fd\u6eab\u4e5f\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u71b1\uff0c\u51b0\u6c34\u4e0d\u80fd\u5bd2\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e4b\u985e\u3002\u7576\u6b64\u4e4b\u6642\uff0c\u826f\u5de5\u4e0d\u80fd\u6b62\uff0c\u5fc5\u9808\u5176\u81ea\u8870\uff0c\u4e43\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u4e5f\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u8aaa\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1b\u7d93\u8a00\u7121\u523a\u7187\u7187\u4e4b\u71b1\uff0c\u7121\u523a\u6e3e\u6e3e\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u7121\u523a\u6f09\u6f09\u4e4b\u6c57\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u5176\u75c5\u9006\u672a\u53ef\u6cbb\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u7627\u4e4b\u59cb\u767c\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u7576\u662f\u4e4b\u6642\uff0c\u967d\u865b\u800c\u9670\u76db\uff0c\u5916\u7121\u6c23\uff0c\u6545\u5148\u5bd2\u6144\u4e5f\u3002\u9670\u6c23\u9006\u6975\uff0c\u5247\u5fa9\u51fa\u4e4b\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u8207\u9670\u5fa9\u5e76\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u5247\u9670\u865b\u800c\u967d\u5be6\uff0c\u6545\u5148\u71b1\u800c\u6e34\u3002\u592b\u7627\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u65bc\u967d\u5247\u967d\u52dd\uff0c\u5e76\u65bc\u9670\u5247\u9670\u52dd\uff0c\u9670\u52dd\u5247\u5bd2\uff0c\u967d\u52dd\u5247\u71b1\u3002\u7627\u8005\uff0c\u98a8\u5bd2\u4e4b\u6c23\u4e0d\u5e38\u4e5f\uff0c\u75c5\u6975\u5247\u5fa9\u3002\u81f3\u75c5\u4e4b\u767c\u4e5f\uff0c\u5982\u706b\u4e4b\u71b1\uff0c\u5982\u98a8\u96e8\u4e0d\u53ef\u7576\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u7d93\u8a00\u66f0\uff1a\u65b9\u5176\u76db\u6642\u5fc5\u6bc0\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8870\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e8b\u5fc5\u5927\u660c\u3002\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u7627\u4e4b\u672a\u767c\u4e5f\uff0c\u9670\u672a\u5e76\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u672a\u5e76\u9670\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u771f\u6c23\u5f97\u5b89\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u4e43\u4ea1\uff0c\u6545\u5de5\u4e0d\u80fd\u6cbb\u5176\u5df2\u767c\uff0c\u70ba\u5176\u6c23\u9006\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u653b\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\uff0c\u65e9\u664f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7627\u4e4b\u4e14\u767c\u4e5f\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u4e14\u79fb\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fc5\u5f9e\u56db\u672b\u59cb\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u5df2\u50b7\uff0c\u9670\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u5148\u5176\u6642\u5805\u675f\u5176\u8655\uff0c\u4ee4\u90aa\u6c23\u4e0d\u5f97\u5165\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u4e0d\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u5be9\u5019\u898b\u4e4b\u5728\u5b6b\u7d61\u76db\u5805\u800c\u8840\u8005\u7686\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b64\u771f\u5f80\u800c\u672a\u5f97\u5e76\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7627\u4e0d\u767c\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7627\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u66f4\u76db\u66f4\u865b\uff0c\u7576\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u5728\u4e5f\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u967d\uff0c\u5247\u71b1\u800c\u8108\u8e81\uff1b\u5728\u9670\uff0c\u5247\u5bd2\u800c\u8108\u975c\uff1b\u6975\u5247\u9670\u967d\u4ff1\u8870\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u76f8\u96e2\uff0c\u6545\u75c5\u5f97\u4f11\uff1b\u885b\u6c23\u96c6\uff0c\u5247\u5fa9\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked: A disease that has too much heat and not enough cold is called 'feng.' Boiling water cannot warm it, and ice water cannot cool it; both have an excess and a deficiency. At such a time, an expert physician cannot treat it but must let it decline. Why so? I would like to hear the explanation. Qi Bo said: A classic text does not prescribe acupuncture for excessive heat, does not prescribe acupuncture for abundant blood vessels, and does not prescribe acupuncture for perspiration. Therefore, a disease is incurable when it reaches this stage. The classic text says, 'At the height of its course, one must destroy it; in decline, one must aid it, and there will be great success.' </p> <p>Feng, he continued, begins with an imbalance between yang and yin energies. When that occurs, yang is depleted while yin is excessive, resulting in a lack of external energy and thus the initial stage presents with cold symptoms. When yin energy becomes excessively dominant, it will cause yang to resurface, and both yin and yang become unbalanced externally; this leads to an initial state of heat and thirst. </p> <p>In feng disease, he explained, when yang or yin energies predominate, the result is either cold or heat. When the yin energy prevails, there are cold symptoms; when the yang energy prevails, there are heat symptoms. Feng, or wind-cold energy, is not constant and extremes of disease can resolve. </p> <p>By the time the illness has fully manifested, he said, it is like a fire that is intense or a storm that cannot be withstood. Therefore, the classic text states: 'When its full force appears, it will collapse; when it declines, one must aid it, and there will be great success.' This is what I mean. </p> <p>If feng has not yet fully manifested, he said, and yin and yang energies have not become unbalanced, regulate them. When true energy is at peace, evil energy will vanish, and the physician cannot treat an already-manifested illness because the energy is out of balance. </p> <p>The Emperor asked: How should one intervene in the early stages of feng and what about late stages? Qi Bo said: In the early stages of feng, yin and yang energies have not yet become unbalanced, but if left untreated, they will become imbalanced. Beginning at the four extremities, first strengthen yang energy so it can protect against the invasion of evil energy; do not let yin energy overflow and do not let yang energy escape. Observe carefully and take blood samples from those who are sinewy and strong. This is a preparatory stage that has not yet reached harmony. </p> <p>If feng has not yet manifested, he said, its energies will fluctuate between excess and deficiency. If the disease is located in the yang energy, there will be heat and blood vessels will be agitated; if it is located in the yin energy, there will be cold symptoms and blood vessels will be quiet. Extremes of either can cause both yin and yang energies to decline, separating defensive Qi energies and leading to illness. When defensive Qi gathers, the disease may return.</p> <p>6: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6642\u6709\u9593\u4e8c\u65e5\u6216\u81f3\u6578\u65e5\u767c\uff0c\u6216\u6e34\u6216\u4e0d\u6e34\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u9593\u65e5\u8005\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u8207\u885b\u6c23\u5ba2\u65bc\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u6642\u76f8\u5931\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f8\u5f97\uff0c\u6545\u4f11\u6578\u65e5\u4e43\u4f5c\u4e5f\u3002\u7627\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u66f4\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u6216\u751a\u6216\u4e0d\u751a\uff0c\u6545\u6216\u6e34\u6216\u4e0d\u6e34\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8ad6\u8a00\u590f\u50b7\u65bc\u6691\uff0c\u79cb\u5fc5\u75c5\u7627\uff0c\u4eca\u7627\u4e0d\u5fc5\u61c9\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u61c9\u56db\u6642\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u5176\u75c5\u7570\u5f62\u8005\uff0c\u53cd\u56db\u6642\u4e5f\u3002\u5176\u4ee5\u79cb\u75c5\u8005\u5bd2\u751a\uff0c\u4ee5\u51ac\u75c5\u8005\u5bd2\u4e0d\u751a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6625\u75c5\u8005\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u590f\u75c5\u8005\u591a\u6c57\u3002 The emperor asked: In some cases, there may be an interval of two or several days, and one may feel thirsty or not feel thirsty. What is the reason for this? Duke Huan responded: During that period, the pathogenic qi and the defensive qi are in conflict at the six departments, and sometimes they cannot find each other, resulting in rest. This occurs because yin and yang may be predominant to varying degrees, leading one to feel thirsty or not feel thirsty. The emperor asked: Discussing the topic of summer ailments caused by heat, if someone falls ill with fever in the autumn, why is it not necessarily applicable today? Duke Huan responded: This applies to seasonal diseases. Someone's illness manifesting abnormally is due to the reversal of the seasons. In cases where one becomes ill in autumn, they are particularly cold; in cases where one becomes ill in winter, they are not excessively cold; in cases where one becomes ill in spring, there is excessive wind; and in cases where one becomes ill in summer, there is excessive sweating.</p> <p>7: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u75c5\u6eab\u7627\u8207\u5bd2\u7627\u800c\u7686\u5b89\u820d\uff0c\u820d\u65bc\u4f55\u85cf\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6eab\u7627\u8005\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u51ac\u4e2d\u65bc\u98a8\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c23\u85cf\u65bc\u9aa8\u9ad3\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u81f3\u6625\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u5927\u767c\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u9047\u5927\u6691\uff0c\u8166\u9ad3\u720d\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u6d88\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u767c\u6cc4\uff0c\u6216\u6709\u6240\u7528\u529b\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u8207\u6c57\u7686\u51fa\uff0c\u6b64\u75c5\u85cf\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u5148\u5f9e\u5167\u51fa\u4e4b\u65bc\u5916\u4e5f\u3002\u5982\u662f\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u865b\u800c\u967d\u76db\uff0c\u967d\u76db\u5247\u71b1\u77e3\uff0c\u8870\u5247\u6c23\u5fa9\u53cd\u5165\uff0c\u5165\u5247\u967d\u865b\uff0c\u967d\u865b\u5247\u5bd2\u77e3\uff0c\u6545\u5148\u71b1\u800c\u5f8c\u5bd2\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u6eab\u7627\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7649\u7627\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7649\u7627\u8005\uff0c\u80ba\u7d20\u6709\u71b1\u6c23\u76db\u65bc\u8eab\uff0c\u53a5\u9006\u4e0a\u885d\uff0c\u4e2d\u6c23\u5be6\u800c\u4e0d\u5916\u6cc4\uff0c\u56e0\u6709\u6240\u7528\u529b\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u958b\uff0c\u98a8\u5bd2\u820d\u65bc\u76ae\u819a\u4e4b\u5167\u3001\u5206\u8089\u4e4b\u9592\u800c\u767c\uff0c\u767c\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u76db\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u76db\u800c\u4e0d\u8870\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u77e3\u3002\u5176\u6c23\u4e0d\u53ca\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u6545\u4f46\u71b1\u800c\u4e0d\u5bd2\uff0c\u6c23\u5167\u85cf\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u800c\u5916\u820d\u65bc\u5206\u8089\u4e4b\u9592\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u6d88\u720d\u812b\u8089\uff0c\u6545\u547d\u66f0\u7649\u7627\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Emperor said: Both fever with heat and cold are secure, where is the shelter? Duke of Shou said: The one with heat, obtained in winter from wind, the qi is hidden in the bone marrow during spring when the Yang qi expands greatly, the pathogenic qi cannot be released by itself, encountering great summer heat, the brain and marrow dry up, muscles dissolve, tendons leak fluids, and there may be some force used. The pathogenic qi and sweat all come out, this illness is sheltered in the kidney, and its qi first comes out from within to go outside. If so, yin is deficient and yang is abundant, yang being abundant leads to heat, and when it weakens, the qi returns, and yin becomes deficient, leading to cold, hence it is called heat evil.</p> <p>Emperor asked: What about febrile disease? Duke of Shou said: Febrile disease, the lungs have a hot qi in the body, the excess overturns, and the qi is full in the center but not released outside, causing some force to be used. Tendons open, wind and cold hide within the skin and subcutaneous tissue while manifesting, when Yang qi is abundant, and Yang being abundant does not weaken, then there is illness. Its qi does not reach yin, hence only heat but no cold, its qi is sheltered in the heart, and released outside in the subcutaneous tissue, causing the person to waste away, dry up, and shed skin, hence it is called febrile disease. Emperor said: Good.</p>"},{"location":"36_huangdi-neijing_ci-nve_zh_translated/","title":"\u523a\u7627","text":"<p>1: \u8db3\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u7627\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u8170\u75db\u982d\u91cd\uff0c\u5bd2\u5f9e\u80cc\u8d77\uff0c\u5148\u5bd2\u5f8c\u71b1\uff0c\u7187\u7187\u668d\u668d\u7136\uff0c\u71b1\u6b62\u6c57\u51fa\uff0c\u96e3\u5df2\uff0c\u523a\u90c4\u4e2d\u51fa\u8840\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u7627\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u8eab\u9ad4\u89e3\u344a\uff0c\u5bd2\u4e0d\u751a\uff0c\u71b1\u4e0d\u751a\uff0c\u60e1\u898b\u4eba\uff0c\u898b\u4eba\u5fc3\u60d5\u60d5\u7136\uff0c\u71b1\u591a\u6c57\u51fa\u751a\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u3002\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u7627\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5148\u5bd2\u6d12\u6dc5\u6d12\u6dc5\u5bd2\u751a\u4e45\u4e43\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u53bb\u6c57\u51fa\u559c\u898b\u65e5\u6708\u5149\u706b\u6c23\uff0c\u4e43\u5feb\u7136\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u8dd7\u4e0a\uff0c\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u7627\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u4e0d\u6a02\uff0c\u597d\u5927\u606f\uff0c\u4e0d\u55dc\u98df\uff0c\u591a\u5bd2\u71b1\u6c57\u51fa\uff0c\u75c5\u81f3\u5247\u5584\u5614\uff0c\u5614\u5df2\u4e43\u8870\uff0c\u5373\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u7627\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5614\u5410\u751a\uff0c\u591a\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u591a\u5bd2\u5c11\uff1b\u6b32\u9589\u6236\u7256\u800c\u8655\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u96e3\u5df2\u3002\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u7627\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u8170\u75db\u5c11\u8179\u6eff\uff0c\u5c0f\u4fbf\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u5982\u7643\u72c0\uff0c\u975e\u7643\u4e5f\uff0c\u6578\u4fbf\uff0c\u610f\u6050\u61fc\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8179\u4e2d\u6092\u6092\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u3002 The ailments associated with the foot [Yang] channel are as follows:  1.

In cases where the pulse is full and large, in an urgent situation, insert one needle each at the five Shu points of the affected area, and proceed to extract blood. If the pulse is somewhat full but empty, it is more suitable to use medicine rather than needles; needles should not be used. In treating febrile diseases as soon as they appear, within a short time they can be cured, but if one misses this opportunity, it will be too late.

Before the onset of the convulsion, insert a needle at the appropriate location. One insertion results in weakness, two insertions allow identification of the affected meridian, and three insertions resolve the issue. If the issue persists, insert a needle below the tongue to bleed the meridians; if it still persists, insert a needle into the center of the chest to release the meridians. Additionally, if a needle is inserted at the point located below the shoulder blade on the affected side, the issue will be resolved. The two meridians beneath the tongue are referred to as pure springs.</p> <p>6: \u523a\u7627\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u554f\u5176\u75c5\u4e4b\u6240\u5148\u767c\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u5148\u982d\u75db\u53ca\u91cd\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u523a\u982d\u4e0a\u53ca\u5169\u984d\u5169\u7709\u9592\u51fa\u8840\u3002\u5148\u9805\u80cc\u75db\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u5148\u8170\u810a\u75db\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u523a\u90c4\u4e2d\u51fa\u8840\uff0c\u5148\u624b\u81c2\u75db\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u523a\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u967d\u660e\u5341\u6307\u9592\u3002\u5148\u8db3\u811b\u75e0\u75db\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u523a\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u5341\u6307\u9592\u51fa\u8840\u3002\u98a8\u7627\uff0c\u7627\u767c\u5247\u6c57\u51fa\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u523a\u4e09\u967d\u7d93\u80cc\u4fde\u4e4b\u8840\u8005\uff0c\u4bd2\u75e0\u75db\u751a\u6309\u4e4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u540d\u66f0\u80d5\u9ad3\u75c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u9471\u937c\u937c\u7d55\u9aa8\u51fa\u8840\uff0c\u7acb\u5df2\u3002\u8eab\u9ad4\u5c0f\u75db\uff0c\u523a\u81f3\u9670\u3002\u8af8\u9670\u4e4b\u4e95\u7121\u51fa\u8840\uff0c\u9592\u65e5\u4e00\u523a\u3002\u7627\u4e0d\u6e34\uff0c\u9592\u65e5\u800c\u4f5c\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u3002\u6e34\u800c\u9592\u65e5\u4f5c\uff0c\u523a\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u3002\u6eab\u7627\u6c57\u4e0d\u51fa\uff0c\u70ba\u4e94\u5341\u4e5d\u523a\u3002 For a person with chills, first inquire about the location where the illness first manifested and then acupuncture that area.

The Liver moves cold to the Heart, causing madness. The Heart moves cold to the Lungs, and the Lungs waste away. Wasting of the lungs is characterized by coughing up phlegm and blood, and this cannot be treated. The Lung moves cold to the Kidney, causing an excess of water. In cases of excess water, pressing the abdomen does not alleviate the pain.

The Duke answered: All the five organs and six sense organs can cause people to sneeze, it's not just the lungs. Emperor said: I would like to hear more about this. The Duke said: The skin and hair are what the lungs control. The skin and hair are the first to be affected by pathogenic qi, and the pathogenic qi follows their control. When cold drinks or food enter the stomach, they travel along the lung channel to the lungs, causing the lungs to become cold. Cold lungs cause internal and external control to merge, and the pathogenic factor attacks the body, resulting in a lung sneeze. Each of the five organs is affected by disease at different times, and none of them are unaffected. People and heaven harmonize with each other, so the five organs each have their ways of treatment. When it's cold, they are susceptible to disease, mild cases result in sneezing, while severe cases lead to leaking or pain. Riding autumn, the lungs are the first to be affected by pathogenic factors, riding spring causes the liver to be first affected, riding summer causes the heart to be first affected, riding yin results in the spleen being the first affected, and riding winter leads to the kidneys being the first affected.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u7570\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u80ba\u6b2c\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u6b2c\u800c\u5598\u606f\u6709\u97f3\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u553e\u8840\u3002\u5fc3\u6b2c\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u6b2c\u5247\u5fc3\u75db\u3002\u5589\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4ecb\u5982\u6897\u72c0\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u54bd\u816b\u5589\u75fa\u3002\u809d\u6b2c\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u6b2c\u5247\u5169\u8107\u4e0b\u75db\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f49\uff0c\u8f49\u5247\u5169\u80e0\u4e0b\u6eff\u3002\u813e\u6b2c\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u6b2c\u5247\u53f3\u8107\u4e0b\u75db\u9670\u9670\u5f15\u80a9\u80cc\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u52d5\uff0c\u52d5\u5247\u6b2c\u5287\u3002\u814e\u6b2c\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u6b2c\u5247\u8170\u80cc\u76f8\u5f15\u800c\u75db\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u6b2c\u6d8e\u3002 The emperor asked, What is the peculiarity of this?

If the spleen is not relieved, it affects the stomach; when the stomach is disturbed, it causes nausea and vomiting. If this persists, worms will appear. If the liver is not relieved, it affects the gallbladder; when the gallbladder is disturbed, it causes qi to rise up and there will be bile secretion.

If the heart is not relieved, it affects the small intestine; when the small intestine is disturbed, there will be shortness of breath and loss of vital energy. If the kidneys are not relieved, it affects the bladder; when the bladder is disturbed, there will be incontinence.

Thus, there is sudden pain. When warmed, the pain stops, because heating is more effective in this case. Cold Qi residing within the channels is thinner than fire Qi, resulting in a full pulse, which hurts but cannot be pressed, and when cold Qi ascends from above, the pulse is large and disorderly, causing great pain that cannot be pressed. When cold Qi resides in the intestines, the ligament of the mucosa does not allow blood to disperse, causing small vessel referral pain; pressing it causes blood to disperse, stopping the pain. Cold Qi residing at the lumbar vertebrae causes a deep pulse that cannot be reached, making pressing ineffective. Cold Qi residing in the Chong channel, originating from the Ren channel and ascending along the middle line, results in an obstructed pulse when cold Qi is present, causing breathing difficulty and shortness of breath. When cold Qi resides at the Bladder channel, the pulse weeps, indicating blood deficiency, which causes pain when it is pulled together by the Bladder; pressing leads to the arrival of fire Qi, stopping the pain. Cold Qi residing in the liver channel causes the reining Qi to be obstructed at the kidneys. Kidney yin is depleted, but yang Qi has not yet entered, causing sudden death without anyone knowing. Reversal of Qi leads to life again. Cold Qi residing in the intestines causes reining Qi to rise, resulting in pain with vomiting. Cold Qi residing in the small intestine causes it not to gather, resulting in diarrhea and lower abdominal pain. When fire Qi remains in the small intestine, there is pain in the intestines, fever, and scorched thirst, leading to constipation and an inability to release them, causing pain and closure without flow.

I know that all diseases arise from Qi, anger causes Qi to rise, joy causes Qi to become calm, sorrow causes Qi to dissipate, fear causes Qi to descend, cold causes Qi to contract, heat causes Qi to discharge, shock causes Qi to be disordered, labor causes Qi to deplete, and thought causes Qi to congeal. Qi has nine different manifestations; how can diseases arise? </p> <p>Marquis Wen said: When angry, Qi rises up excessively, causing vomiting of blood and purging of the bowels, so it is Qi that rises. When joyful, Qi becomes harmonious and spirit moves smoothly, causing the defense qi to flow freely through the channels, so it is Qi that becomes calm. When sorrowful, the heart is bound tightly, the lungs spread out their leaves and raise them up, yet the middle jiao does not communicate, and the defensive qi does not scatter, so it is Qi that dissipates. When afraid, the vital essence scatters, causing the middle jiao to close, and when closed, the Qi returns and causes the lower jiao to distend, so it is Qi that does not circulate. Cold causes the networks and vessels to contract, preventing Qi from circulating, so it is Qi that contracts. When heated, the networks and vessels open, causing the defense qi to sweat profusely, so it is Qi that discharges. When shocked, the heart has nowhere to rely on, the spirit has nowhere to return, the mind has no place to settle, so it is Qi that becomes disordered. When working hard, there is panting and sweating, both internally and externally are out of balance, so it is Qi that depletes. When thinking, the heart has a place to store, the spirit has a place to return, the genuine qi remains but does not circulate, so it is Qi that congeals</p>"},{"location":"3_huangdi-neijing_sheng-qi-tong-tian-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u751f\u6c23\u901a\u5929\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u81ea\u53e4\u901a\u5929\u8005\u751f\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u672c\u65bc\u9670\u967d\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u516d\u5408\u4e4b\u5167\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e5d\u5dde\u4e5d\u7ac5\u4e94\u85cf\u5341\u4e8c\u7bc0\uff0c\u7686\u901a\u4e4e\u5929\u6c23\u3002\u5176\u751f\u4e94\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e09\uff0c\u6578\u72af\u6b64\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u90aa\u6c23\u50b7\u4eba\uff0c\u6b64\u58fd\u547d\u4e4b\u672c\u4e5f\u3002\u84bc\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u6e05\u6de8\uff0c\u5247\u5fd7\u610f\u6cbb\uff0c\u9806\u4e4b\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u56fa\uff0c\u96d6\u6709\u8cca\u90aa\uff0c\u5f17\u80fd\u5bb3\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b64\u56e0\u6642\u4e4b\u5e8f\u3002\u6545\u8056\u4eba\u50b3\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u670d\u5929\u6c23\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u795e\u660e\u3002\u5931\u4e4b\u5247\u5167\u9589\u4e5d\u7ac5\uff0c\u5916\u58c5\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u6563\u89e3\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u81ea\u50b7\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u524a\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: The foundation of connecting with heaven is from ancient times. It comes from the space between yin and yang, within the six harmonies, nine zones and five layers, and twelve channels. Their qi connects to the celestial qi. When there are five openings and three layers, often falling into this, evil qi harms people, which is the basis of life and death. The pure and clear qi of the sky regulates intention and follows it, leading to the strengthening of yang qi, even if there are external evil influences, they cannot harm. This is due to the appropriate order of the times. Therefore, sages transmit spirit and serve celestial qi in order to connect with the divine light. Failing this, nine apertures close internally, exterior muscles harden, guarding and dispersing qi, which is called self-harm and the decline of qi.</p> <p>2: \u967d\u6c23\u8005\u82e5\u5929\u8207\u65e5\uff0c\u5931\u5176\u6240\uff0c\u5247\u6298\u58fd\u800c\u4e0d\u5f70\uff0c\u6545\u5929\u904b\u7576\u4ee5\u65e5\u5149\u660e\u3002\u662f\u6545\u967d\u56e0\u800c\u4e0a\uff0c\u885b\u5916\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u56e0\u65bc\u5bd2\uff0c\u6b32\u5982\u904b\u6a1e\uff0c\u8d77\u5c45\u5982\u9a5a\uff0c\u795e\u6c23\u4e43\u6d6e\u3002\u56e0\u65bc\u6691\uff0c\u6c57\u7169\u5247\u5598\u559d\uff0c\u975c\u5247\u591a\u8a00\uff0c\u9ad4\u82e5\u71d4\u70ad\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\u800c\u6563\u3002\u56e0\u65bc\u6fd5\uff0c\u9996\u5982\u88f9\uff0c\u6fd5\u71b1\u4e0d\u6518\uff0c\u5927\u7b4b\u7ddb\u77ed\uff0c\u5c0f\u7b4b\u5f1b\u9577\uff0c\u7ddb\u77ed\u70ba\u62d8\uff0c\u5f1b\u9577\u70ba\u75ff\u3002\u56e0\u65bc\u6c23\uff0c\u70ba\u816b\uff0c\u56db\u7dad\u76f8\u4ee3\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u4e43\u7aed\u3002 If one is like the sun and heaven, losing their place will result in a bent life that does not shine brightly. Therefore, celestial stems correspond to solar illumination. Hence, the Yang Qi ascends above, and pertains to the outlying area (i.e., the periphery of the body). Because of Cold, one wishes to be like an axis, arising and settling as if startled; the spirit energy rises. Because of Heat, sweat vexes and causes panting and hoarse speech; in silence, it results in much speaking; the body is like scorched charcoal with sweat being released to disperse. Because of Dampness, the head is like a swaddling cloth, damp heat does not distinguish boundaries, large sinews are tightened and shortened, small sinews are loosened and lengthened; tightening and shortening leads to rigidity, while loosening and lengthening lead to weakness. Because of Qi, there is distention, with the four limbs taking turns in being distended; Yang Qi is depleted.</p> <p>3: \u967d\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u7169\u52de\u5247\u5f35\uff0c\u7cbe\u7d55\u8f9f\u7a4d\uff0c\u65bc\u590f\u4f7f\u4eba\u714e\u53a5\u3002\u76ee\u76f2\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u8996\uff0c\u8033\u9589\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u807d\uff0c\u6f70\u6f70\u4e4e\u82e5\u58de\u90fd\uff0c\u6c68\u6c68\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6b62\u3002\u967d\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u5927\u6012\u5247\u5f62\u6c23\u7d55\uff0c\u800c\u8840\u83c0\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u8584\u53a5\u3002\u6709\u50b7\u65bc\u7b4b\u7e31\uff0c\u5176\u82e5\u4e0d\u5bb9\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\u504f\u6cae\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u504f\u67af\u3002\u6c57\u51fa\u898b\u6fd5\uff0c\u4e43\u751f\u75e4\u75bf\u3002\u9ad8\u6881\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u8db3\u751f\u5927\u4e01\uff0c\u53d7\u5982\u6301\u865b\u3002\u52de\u6c57\u7576\u98a8\uff0c\u5bd2\u8584\u70ba\u76bb\uff0c\u9b31\u4e43\u75e4\u3002 Persons with excessive Yang Qi, when fatigued or overworked, their Essence is depleted and accumulated, causing them to be scorched in summer. Their eyesight cannot see, and they cannot hear with their ears, and saliva drools uncontrollably, like the ruins of a city. When Yang Qi becomes enraged, one's physical condition is disrupted, causing blood to flow upward, leading to dizziness. There are injuries to the tendons that cannot be tolerated; sweating occurs on one side, leading to emaciation in one part. Sweat is visible and generates boils and swelling. High fever leads to the formation of large blisters, which are as difficult to hold as emptiness.

If one cannot open or close, cold Qi will invade, leading to the formation of large swellings. Blood stagnation is like a piglet stuck in a drainpipe, leaving behind tendons and sinews. Yang Qi transforms into thinness, spreading fear and shock. If the energy does not circulate properly, it goes against the flesh's principles and causes boils and tumors. Before the soul sweat has evaporated, one's form is weak and energy is depleted, closing the acupuncture points leads to wind sickness. Therefore, wind is the source of all diseases; when calm and clear, the flesh and sinews close and reject even harsh winds and toxic poisons. If a disease persists, it will change forms and not parallel up and down, making it difficult for skilled doctors to treat. Thus, Yang Qi accumulates diseases leading to death, while Yang Qi must be separated; separation must be written, without delay in proper treatment, leading to failure</p> <p>5: \u6545\u967d\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u65e5\u800c\u4e3b\u5916\uff0c\u5e73\u65e6\u4eba\u6c23\u751f\uff0c\u65e5\u4e2d\u800c\u967d\u6c23\u9686\uff0c\u65e5\u897f\u800c\u967d\u6c23\u5df2\u865b\uff0c\u6c23\u9580\u4e43\u9589\u3002\u662f\u6545\u66ae\u800c\u6536\u62d2\uff0c\u7121\u64fe\u7b4b\u9aa8\uff0c\u7121\u898b\u9727\u9732\uff0c\u53cd\u6b64\u4e09\u6642\uff0c\u5f62\u4e43\u56f0\u8584\u3002 Individuals with a yang nature: by midday they are in charge, and the qi of the people is generated at night.

If Yin does not overcome Yang, then the pulse will flow thinly and rapidly, leading to madness. If Yang does not overcome Yin, then the five organs struggle for Qi, and the nine orifices do not communicate. Thus, the sage person establishes Yin and Yang, coordinates tendons and vessels, and makes bone marrow strong and firm, allowing Qi and blood to flow well.

Hence indulgence in food leads to the sinews' dispersion, causing the intestines to form fistulas. Thus great drinking results in reversed Qi. Thus exerting oneself causes kidney Qi to be injured and bones to decay. In all matters of yin and yang, yang being sealed is key; if the two do not harmonize, it is like spring without autumn or winter without summer. Hence to harmonize them, this is called sheng du. Therefore, when yang is strong but cannot be sealed, yin Qi will vanish; yin is leveled and yang concealed, spirit will be treated, yin and yang separate, and Qi of spirit will vanish due to exposure to cold wind, thus giving rise to cold and heat.</p> <p>8: \u662f\u4ee5\u6625\u50b7\u65bc\u98a8\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u7559\u9023\uff0c\u4e43\u70ba\u6d1e\u6cc4\u3002\u590f\u50b7\u65bc\u6691\uff0c\u79cb\u70ba\u75ce\u7627\u3002\u79cb\u50b7\u65bc\u6fd5\uff0c\u4e0a\u9006\u800c\u6b2c\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u75ff\u53a5\u3002\u51ac\u50b7\u65bc\u5bd2\uff0c\u6625\u5fc5\u6eab\u75c5\u3002\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u66f4\u50b7\u4e94\u85cf\u3002 Therefore, the harm caused by the spring wind gives rise to a cold condition; the pathogenic qi lingers and results in an excretion.

Therefore, if the taste is excessively sour, liver qi will dominate with fluids, spleen qi will be exhausted. If the taste is overly salty, bone qi will labor, muscles will be short, heart qi will be repressed. If the taste is too sweet, heart qi will pant heavily, complexion will be black and kidney qi will not regulate. If the taste is excessively bitter, spleen qi will not moisten, stomach qi will become thick. If the taste is overly pungent, channels and vessels will collapse, spirit will be dispersed. Therefore, carefully harmonize the five tastes, so that bones will be upright and muscles pliable, qi and blood will circulate, essences will be subtle, practice the way according to law, and one can enjoy longevity by following heaven's decrees</p>"},{"location":"40_huangdi-neijing_fu-zhong-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u8179\u4e2d\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u75c5\u5fc3\u8179\u6eff\uff0c\u65e6\u98df\u5247\u4e0d\u80fd\u66ae\u98df\uff0c\u6b64\u70ba\u4f55\u75c5\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u540d\u70ba\u9f13\u8139\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u4ee5\u96de\u77e2\u91b4\u4e00\u5291\u77e5\u4e8c\u5291\u5df2\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6642\u6709\u5fa9\u767c\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u98f2\u98df\u4e0d\u7bc0\uff0c\u6545\u6642\u6709\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u5176\u75c5\u4e14\u5df2\uff0c\u6642\u6545\u7576\u75c5\uff0c\u6c23\u805a\u65bc\u8179\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor asked: One has a full heart and abdomen, and cannot eat in the morning if they eat at night.

What is this disease, and can it be treated? Hui Bo replied: The name of the disease is Fu Ling. Emperor: How does one contract the Fu Ling disease? Hui Bo answered: It occurs from wrapping the intestines with blood, residing outside the stomach and intestines, and cannot be treated. If treated, pressing it will inevitably lead to death. Emperor: Why is that so? Hui Bo replied: Below, it is caused by yin deficiency causing intestinal bleeding; above, it is due to pressure on the diaphragm and spleen, causing ulcers in the diaphragm and spleen. This is a long-standing disease difficult to treat. As for someone living in Qi who is upstairs as a rebel and downstairs as a follower, do not act hastily or seize urgently; discuss it in the context of acupuncture law. Emperor: When people have hip and knee joint pain, their bodies are swollen and surrounded by pain, what disease is this? Hui Bo replied: The disease is called Fu Ling, and it is a wind-related illness. Its energy overflowed in the large intestine and settled on the tendons, and the roots of the tendons are below. Therefore, it surrounds the hip and causes pain. Do not move it, as moving it will cause water drowning disease.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u6578\u8a00\u71b1\u4e2d\u6d88\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u670d\u9ad8\u6881\u82b3\u8349\u77f3\u85e5\uff0c\u77f3\u85e5\u767c\u7628\uff0c\u82b3\u8349\u767c\u72c2\u3002\u592b\u71b1\u4e2d\u6d88\u4e2d\u8005\u7686\u5bcc\u8cb4\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eca\u7981\u9ad8\u6881\uff0c\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u5176\u5fc3\uff0c\u7981\u82b3\u8349\u77f3\u85e5\uff0c\u662f\u75c5\u4e0d\u6108\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u8aaa\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u82b3\u8349\u4e4b\u6c23\u7f8e\uff0c\u77f3\u85e5\u4e4b\u6c23\u608d\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5176\u6c23\u6025\u75be\u5805\u52c1\uff0c\u6545\u975e\u7de9\u5fc3\u548c\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u670d\u6b64\u4e8c\u8005\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u670d\u6b64\u4e8c\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u7136\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u71b1\u6c23\u6153\u608d\uff0c\u85e5\u6c23\u4ea6\u7136\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u76f8\u9047\u6050\u5167\u50b7\u813e\u3002\u813e\u8005\u571f\u4e5f\u800c\u60e1\u6728\uff0c\u670d\u6b64\u85e5\u8005\uff0c\u81f3\u7532\u4e59\u65e5\u66f4\u8ad6\u3002 The Emperor said: Master Zh\u016b says that, in treating fever, one should not use high-ranking medicinal herbs such as flowers, grasses, and stones. Stones produce toxins, while flowers induce madness. The fever patients are usually wealthy and powerful individuals. Prohibiting the use of high-ranking herbs is against their wishes; prohibiting the use of flower and stone medicines will not cure them. I would like to hear your opinion on this matter. Lord Bi said: The virtues of flower and stone medicines are potent and swift, but they are not suitable for those who need to calm their hearts and harmonize with others. The Emperor asked: Why are they not suitable? Lord Bi replied: Because the fever energy is fierce and uncontrollable, the energy of the medicines is also like this. Combining them may cause internal damage to the spleen. The spleen represents earth and dislikes wood. Those who take these medicines will have more discussions on the day of jia and yi.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6709\u75c5\u81ba\u816b\u9838\u75db\u80f8\u6eff\u8179\u8139\u6b64\u70ba\u4f55\u75c5\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u5f97\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u540d\u53a5\u9006\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7078\u4e4b\u5247\u7616\uff0c\u77f3\u4e4b\u5247\u72c2\uff0c\u9808\u5176\u6c23\u5e76\uff0c\u4e43\u53ef\u6cbb\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u7136\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u6c23\u91cd\u4e0a\uff0c\u6709\u9918\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u7078\u4e4b\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u5165\u9670\uff0c\u5165\u5247\u7616\uff0c\u77f3\u4e4b\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u72c2\uff0c\u9808\u5176\u6c23\u5e76\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u5168\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor asked, What is this illness that causes one to have the diseases of fever, swollen neck, throat pain, a full chest and distended abdomen?

The diseases are different and have different names. Sometimes it affects the five organs and six palaces, and one does not know how to treat it. I hope to hear your explanation.</p> <p>The Duke answered: Wind energy is stored in the skin's slackness, and it cannot be dispersed internally or externally. Wind is changeable and often causes chills and sweating. If it is cold, one loses strength and appetite; if it is hot, the muscles weaken, causing the person to tremble and unable to eat - this is called cold-heat.</p> <p>Wind energy and Yang Ming enter the stomach and spleen, ascending through the meridians to the eye's surface. If a person is fat, wind energy cannot be released externally, leading to heat in the eyes; if a person is thin, wind is released externally, causing cold in the eyes and tearing.</p> <p>Wind energy and Yang Qi both enter and circulate through the meridians, dispersing into the muscle's slackness and interfering with defensive Qi. If the pathway is not smooth, it causes muscle spasms and sores; if defensive Qi congeals and does not move, the muscles become unyielding.</p> <p>Strokes are caused by excessive heat and unclear Qi, damaging the nasal bridge and causing the skin to degenerate.

Wind affecting the five viscera and six bowels is also called viscera-bowel wind, each entering its gate, resulting in localized or offsetting wind. If wind Qi ascends through the wind palace, it is brain wind; if it enters the head, it is eye wind and eye cold; when drinking, it is leak wind; when inside a room and sweating, it is interior wind; after bathing, it is neck wind; if prolonged, it becomes intestinal wind with diarrhea; outside in the hairy regions, it is a wind of discharge. Thus, wind is the root of myriad diseases. When its transformations become varied and diverse, they may be called epidemic diseases, with no constant treatment, yet they all involve wind Qi. </p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u85cf\u98a8\u4e4b\u5f62\u72c0\u4e0d\u540c\u8005\u4f55\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u8a3a\u53ca\u5176\u75c5\u80fd\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u80ba\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u591a\u6c57\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u8272\u768f\u7136\u767d\uff0c\u6642\u6b2c\u77ed\u6c23\uff0c\u665d\u65e5\u5247\u5dee\uff0c\u66ae\u5247\u751a\uff0c\u8a3a\u5728\u7709\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u767d\uff1b\u5fc3\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u591a\u6c57\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u7126\u7d55\u5584\u6012\u5687\uff0c\u8d64\u8272\uff0c\u75c5\u751a\u5247\u8a00\u4e0d\u53ef\u5feb\uff0c\u8a3a\u5728\u53e3\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u8d64\uff1b\u809d\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u591a\u6c57\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u5584\u60b2\u8272\u5fae\u84bc\uff0c\u55cc\u4e7e\u5584\u6012\uff0c\u6642\u618e\u5973\u5b50\uff0c\u8a3a\u5728\u76ee\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u9752\uff1b\u813e\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u591a\u6c57\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u6020\u58af\uff0c\u56db\u652f\u4e0d\u6b32\u52d5\uff0c\u8272\u8584\u5fae\u9ec3\uff0c\u4e0d\u55dc\u98df\uff0c\u8a3a\u5728\u9f3b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u9ec3\uff1b\u814e\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u591a\u6c57\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u9762\u75dd\u7136\u6d6e\u816b\uff0c\u810a\u75db\u4e0d\u80fd\u6b63\u7acb\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u70b1\uff0c\u96b1\u66f2\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u8a3a\u5728\u808c\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u9ed1\uff0c\u80c3\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u9838\u591a\u6c57\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u98df\u98f2\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u9b32\u585e\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u8179\u5584\u6eff\uff0c\u5931\u8863\u5247\u441c\u8139\uff0c\u98df\u5bd2\u5247\u6cc4\uff0c\u8a3a\u5f62\u7626\u800c\u8179\u5927\uff1b\u9996\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\u982d\u9762\u591a\u6c57\u60e1\u98a8\u7576\u5148\u98a8\u4e00\u65e5\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u751a\u982d\u75db\u4e0d\u53ef\uff0c\u4ee5\u51fa\u5167\u81f3\u5176\u98a8\u65e5\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u5c11\u6108\uff1b\u6f0f\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u6216\u591a\u6c57\uff0c\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u55ae\u8863\uff0c\u98df\u5247\u6c57\u51fa\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u8eab\u6c57\uff0c\u5598\u606f\u60e1\u98a8\uff0c\u8863\u5e38\u6fe1\uff0c\u53e3\u4e7e\u5584\u6e34\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u52de\u4e8b\uff1b\u6cc4\u98a8\u4e4b\u72c0\uff0c\u591a\u6c57\uff0c\u6c57\u51fa\u6cc4\u8863\u4e0a\uff0c\u53e3\u4e2d\u4e7e\u4e0a\u6f2c\uff0c\u5176\u98a8\u4e0d\u80fd\u52de\u4e8b\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u76e1\u75db\u5247\u5bd2\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Emperor: What are the different manifestations of the Five Winds, and I wish to hear about their diagnosis and treatment.

The accumulations do not stop, and it also harms internally, with the dominant winds and qi leading to harm in people.

Zhi Bo said: Those who enter and hide (the qi) die; those who linger on the tendons and bones suffer for a long time; and those who linger on the skin and flesh are easily harmed.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u5ba2\u65bc\u516d\u5e9c\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u4ea6\u5176\u98df\u98f2\u5c45\u8655\uff0c\u70ba\u5176\u75c5\u672c\u4e5f\u3002\u516d\u5e9c\u4ea6\u5404\u6709\u4fde\uff0c\u98a8\u5bd2\u6fd5\u6c23\u4e2d\u5176\u4fde\uff0c\u800c\u98df\u98f2\u61c9\u4e4b\uff0c\u5faa\u4fde\u800c\u5165\uff0c\u5404\u820d\u5176\u5e9c\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4ee5\u937c\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u85cf\u6709\u4fde\uff0c\u516d\u5e9c\u6709\u5408\uff0c\u5faa\u8108\u4e4b\u5206\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u767c\uff0c\u5404\u96a8\u5176\u904e\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u7633\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked, What are the six ministries? The Duke of Zhou replied, This refers to their food and drink and their place of residence, which are the origins of their diseases. Each of the six ministries has its own affinity, and when affected by wind, cold, or dampness, they act according to their affinity and take refuge in their respective ministries. The Emperor asked, How would you treat it with a lancet? The Duke of Zhou replied, The Five Canisters have affinities, and the six ministries have correspondences.

Master Of Gi said: Glory refers to the Qi of grains, regulated in the Five Zang and poured into the Six Fu, which can enter the Meridians. Therefore, by following the Meridians up and down and penetrating the Five Zang and Six Fu. Glory is the fierce Qi of grains, with its Qi agile, swift, slippery, and unable to enter the Meridians. So, by circulating within the skin and flesh, dispersing in the muscles, fumigating on the Lung and Stomach, opposite the Qi will cause disease, following the Qi will cure. If it does not merge with the Wind, Cold, Dampness Qi, it will not be lethargic.</p> <p>Emperor asked: Why is there pain or no pain, or numbness in some cases? Master Of Gi said: Pain indicates that Cold Qi is abundant, and therefore causes pain. Numbness without pain or sensitivity is due to the disease becoming deep-seated, and the disordered flow of Qi and blood at the meridians and collaterals. The skin does not nourish properly, resulting in insensitivity. Cold indicates that Yang Qi is deficient and Yin Qi is abundant, which benefit each other, causing cold. Heat indicates that Yang Qi is abundant and Yin Qi is deficient, and the pathogenic factor attacks Yang or Yin, causing numbness and heat. Sweating and becoming damp indicates meeting excessive Dampness, with Yang Qi deficient and Yin Qi abundant, causing the two Qis to feel each other, resulting in sweating and becoming damp.</p> <p>Emperor asked: What causes numbness without pain? Master Of Gi said: Numbness resides in the bones, making it heavy; numbness resides in the meridians, making blood congeal and not flow; numbness resides in the tendons, making them unable to bend and stretch; numbness resides in the flesh, causing insensitivity; so if all five of these are present, there is no pain. All cases of numbness have different treatments: encountering Cold will cause constriction, encountering Heat will cause stretching.</p> <p>Emperor said: Good. Why do some types of numbness hurt and others do not? Master Of Gi said: Numbness is in the bones, making it heavy; numbness resides in the meridians, causing blood to congeal and not flow; numbness resides in the tendons, making them unable to bend and stretch; numbness resides in the flesh, causing insensitivity; so if all five of these are present, there is no pain. All cases of numbness have different treatments: encountering Cold will cause constriction, encountering Heat will cause stretching.

The Grand Officer replied, The Lung governs the skin and hair of the body, the Heart governs the blood vessels of the body, the Liver governs the tendons and membranes of the body, the Spleen governs the muscle tissue of the body, and the Kidney governs the bone marrow of the body. Therefore, when Lung is heated, the skin and hair become weak, and if they are not properly nourished, it leads to impotence and involuntary discharge; when Heart's Qi is heated, the blood vessels below become deficient while those above become excessive, leading to deficiency of blood vessels below, which results in weak pulse, causing impotence, limp erections, and inability to stand upright; when Liver's Qi is heated, the Gallbladder leaks, causing bitterness, drying up of tendons and membranes, resulting in stiff and spasmodic muscles, leading to impotence; when Spleen's Qi is heated, the Stomach becomes dry and one experiences thirst, muscle tissue not being nourished properly leads to muscle weakness, causing atrophy of muscle tissue; when Kidney's Qi is heated, the backbone does not support properly, bones become brittle and marrow decreases, resulting in impotence due to weak bones.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u5f97\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u80ba\u8005\u85cf\u4e4b\u9577\u4e5f\uff0c\u70ba\u5fc3\u4e4b\u84cb\u4e5f\uff1b\u6709\u6240\u5931\u4ea1\uff0c\u6240\u6c42\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u5247\u767c\u80ba\u9cf4\uff0c\u9cf4\u5247\u80ba\u71b1\u8449\u7126\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u85cf\u56e0\u80ba\u71b1\u8449\u7126\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u75ff\u8e84\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u60b2\u54c0\u592a\u751a\uff0c\u5247\u80de\u7d61\u7d55\uff0c\u80de\u7d61\u7d55\uff0c\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u5167\u52d5\uff0c\u767c\u5247\u5fc3\u4e0b\u5d29\u6578\u6eb2\u8840\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u300a\u672c\u75c5\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u5927\u7d93\u7a7a\u865b\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u808c\u75fa\uff0c\u50b3\u70ba\u8108\u75ff\u3002\u601d\u60f3\u7121\u7aae\uff0c\u6240\u9858\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u610f\u6deb\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u5165\u623f\u592a\u751a\uff0c\u5b97\u7b4b\u5f1b\u7e31\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u7b4b\u75ff\uff0c\u53ca\u70ba\u767d\u6deb\u3002\u6545\u300a\u4e0b\u7d93\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u7b4b\u75ff\u8005\uff0c\u751f\u65bc\u809d\u4f7f\u5167\u4e5f\u3002\u6709\u6f38\u65bc\u6fd5\u4ee5\u6c34\u70ba\u4e8b\uff0c\u82e5\u6709\u6240\u7559\u5c45\u8655\u76f8\u6fd5\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u6fe1\u6f2c\uff0c\u75fa\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec1\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u8089\u75ff\u3002\u6545\u300a\u4e0b\u7d93\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u8089\u75ff\u8005\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u6fd5\u5730\u4e5f\u3002\u6709\u6240\u9060\u884c\u52de\u5026\uff0c\u9022\u5927\u71b1\u800c\u6e34\uff0c\u6e34\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u5167\u4f10\uff0c\u5167\u4f10\u5247\u71b1\u820d\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u814e\u8005\uff0c\u6c34\u85cf\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eca\u6c34\u4e0d\u52dd\u706b\uff0c\u5247\u9aa8\u67af\u800c\u9ad3\u865b\uff0c\u6545\u8db3\u4e0d\u4efb\u8eab\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u9aa8\u75ff\u3002\u6545\u300a\u4e0b\u7d93\u300b\u66f0\uff0c\u9aa8\u75ff\u8005\uff0c\u751f\u65bc\u5927\u71b1\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u5225\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u80ba\u71b1\u8005\uff0c\u8272\u767d\u800c\u6bdb\u6557\uff1b\u5fc3\u71b1\u8005\uff0c\u8272\u8d64\u800c\u7d61\u8108\u6ea2\uff0c\u809d\u71b1\u8005\uff0c\u8272\u84bc\u800c\u722a\u67af\uff1b\u813e\u71b1\u8005\uff0c\u8272\u9ec3\u800c\u8089\u8815\u52d5\uff1b\u814e\u71b1\u8005\uff0c\u8272\u9ed1\u800c\u9f52\u69c1\u3002 The Emperor asked, How can it be obtained? The Duke of Tang replied: The lungs are the storehouse of Qi and serve as a cover for the heart; when there is something lost or missing and one cannot obtain what they seek, the lungs will emit a sound, and once there is a sound, the lungs will heat and burn the leaves, thus causing it to be called 'five storehouses due to lung heat and burning of the leaves.' It is said: when grief is too great, the channels will stop, and once the channels have stopped, the Yang Qi will move internally, leading to palpitations and bleeding below the heart. Therefore, in the treatise on Originating Diseases, it is said: 'Great vacuity leads to muscle paralysis, and this is called the disease.' Contemplation without end results in desires not being fulfilled, and one's intentions become excessive outside, leading to a dwelling place that is too wet. The muscles become flaccid and unable to tendon reflex, resulting in muscle weakness. Therefore, in the treatise on Diseases of the Extremities, it is said: 'Muscle weakness comes from a damp environment.' When one engages in distant travel and becomes tired, encountering great heat while thirsty, the Yang Qi retreats internally, causing the heat to reside in the kidneys, which are the water storehouse. If water cannot withstand fire, then bones will dry up and marrow will be depleted, resulting in weakness of the limbs. Therefore, in the treatise on Diseases of the Extremities, it is said: 'Bone weakness comes from great heat.' The Emperor asked, How can they be distinguished? The Duke of Tang replied: Lung heat manifests as a pale complexion and hair falling; heart heat manifests as a reddish complexion with overflowing channels and vessels; liver heat manifests as a blue-green complexion with nails becoming dry; spleen heat manifests as a yellow complexion with muscle tremors; kidney heat manifests as a dark complexion with teeth becoming worn.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5982\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u53ef\u77e3\uff0c\u8ad6\u8a00\u6cbb\u75ff\u8005\u7368\u53d6\u967d\u660e\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u660e\u8005\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u6d77\uff0c\u4e3b\u958f\u5b97\u7b4b\uff0c\u5b97\u7b4b\u4e3b\u675f\u9aa8\u800c\u5229\u6a5f\u95dc\u4e5f\u3002\u885d\u8108\u8005\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u6d77\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e3b\u6ef2\u704c\u8c3f\u8c37\uff0c\u8207\u967d\u660e\u5408\u65bc\u5b97\u7b4b\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u63d4\u5b97\u7b4b\u4e4b\u6703\uff0c\u6703\u65bc\u6c23\u8857\uff0c\u800c\u967d\u660e\u70ba\u4e4b\u9577\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u5e36\u8108\uff0c\u800c\u7d61\u65bc\u7763\u8108\u3002\u6545\u967d\u660e\u865b\u5247\u5b97\u7b4b\u7e31\uff0c\u5e36\u8108\u4e0d\u5f15\uff0c\u6545\u8db3\u75ff\u4e0d\u7528\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5404\u88dc\u5176\u6ece\u800c\u901a\u5176\u4fde\uff0c\u8abf\u5176\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u548c\u5176\u9006\u9806\uff0c\u7b4b\u8108\u9aa8\u8089\uff0c\u5404\u4ee5\u5176\u6642\u53d7\u6708\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u5df2\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Emperor said: If Master's words are true, how can one take the Yangming for treating paralysis? Hui Bo said: The Yangming is the sea of the Five Zang and Six Fu organs, which governs the Yuan Shen and Gu Qi, and the Yuan Shen governs binding the bones and nourishing the Jing Luo vessels. The Jing vessels are the sea of the Conception Vessel, which governs the Gui and Luo rivers, and merge with the Yangming at the Yuan Shen, where the Yin and Yang meet the Yuan Shen, meeting at the Qi Street. In this case, the Yangming provides length, and all belong to the Conception Vessel, and are governed by the Governor Vessel. Therefore, if the Yangming is deficient, the Yuan Shen is disordered, the Conception Vessel does not guide, and thus the paralysis occurs. Emperor asked: How can it be treated? Hui Bo said: Each organ should be supplemented and opened accordingly, regulate its excess and deficiency, harmonize its ascending and descending, sinews, vessels, bones, and flesh should each be governed by their respective time to receive the moon phase, then the illness will resolve.

Hua Tuo replied: When yang qi declines below, it leads to a cold condition; when yin qi declines below, it leads to a feverish condition. Emperor asked: If the fever condition is due to the foot, what is the reason for this? Hua Tuo said: Yang qi arises from the tips of the five fingers and yin qi gathers at the soles and accumulates in the heart of the foot; therefore, if yin qi prevails, there will be heat at the foot. Emperor asked: What is the cause of cold condition? Hua Tuo said: The yin qi arises from the tips of the five fingers and gathers at the knees and accumulates at the knee cap; hence, if yin qi prevails, there will be cold from the tips of the five fingers to the knees. Emperor asked: Why do cold and fever conditions result in failure? Hua Tuo said: The front yin is where the governing vessels gather and the Taiyang Yingming merge. In spring and summer, there is an abundance of yang qi and a lack of yin qi; in autumn and winter, yin qi flourishes while yang qi declines. This person possesses strength, but due to autumn and winter, it takes away what they need, causing the qi to struggle upwards and not be able to recover, leading to the depletion of essence and allowing pathogenic qi to arise from within. The qi is weakened, yang qi cannot nourish its channels and networks, yang qi gradually decreases, yin qi remains alone, and thus the hands and feet become cold. Emperor asked: What is the nature of fever condition? Hua Tuo said: When food enters the stomach, the network and transporting vessels are filled while the meridian vessels are empty; the spleen governs the stomach's transformation of fluids, yin qi is lacking, leading to yang qi intruding. Yang qi intruding leads to an unbalanced stomach, causing essence qi to be exhausted, essence qi being exhausted leads to failure of nourishing the four limbs, this person will drink excessively as if fully sated and go to bed, causing the qi to gather in the spleen without dispersing, the qi of alcohol and grain mingle, leading to fever within the body and appearing red and flushed. The qi of alcohol is abundant but causes the essence of the kidneys to decline, allowing yang qi to prevail, resulting in heat in the hands and feet. Emperor asked: Can cold and fever conditions cause someone to be bloated and not know who they are? Hua Tuo said: When yin qi prevails above, it leads to deficiency below, causing the abdomen to distend; when yang qi prevails above, the qi rises incorrectly, and pathogenic qi rebels, leading to confusion of yang qi, resulting in not knowing who they are.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u9858\u805e\u516d\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u53a5\u72c0\u75c5\u80fd\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5de8\u967d\u4e4b\u53a5\uff0c\u5247\u816b\u9996\u982d\u91cd\uff0c\u8db3\u4e0d\u80fd\u884c\uff0c\u767c\u70ba\u7734\u4ec6\uff1b\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u53a5\uff0c\u5247\u7672\u75be\u6b32\u8d70\u547c\uff0c\u8179\u6eff\u4e0d\u5f97\u81e5\u9762\u8d64\u800c\u71b1\uff0c\u5984\u898b\u800c\u5984\u8a00\uff1b\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u53a5\uff0c\u5247\u66b4\u807e\u9830\u816b\u800c\u71b1\uff0c\u8107\u75db\uff0c\u4bd2\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u904b\uff1b\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u53a5\uff0c\u5247\u8179\u6eff\u441c\u8139\u5f8c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e0d\u6b32\u98df\uff0c\u98df\u5247\u5614\u4e0d\u5f97\u81e5\uff1b\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u53a5\uff0c\u5247\u53e3\u4e7e\u6eba\u8d64\uff0c\u8179\u6eff\u5fc3\u75db\uff1b\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u53a5\uff0c\u5247\u5c11\u8179\u816b\u75db\uff0c\u8179\u8139\u6d87\u6eb2\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u597d\u81e5\u5c48\u819d\uff0c\u9670\u7e2e\u816b\u4bd2\u5167\u71b1\uff0c\u76db\u5247\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u76db\u4e0d\u865b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7d93\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u592a\u9670\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u4bd2\u6025\u6523\uff0c\u5fc3\u75db\u5f15\u8179\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u865b\u6eff\u5614\u8b8a\uff0c\u4e0b\u6cc4\u6e05\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\uff1b\u53a5\u9670\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u6523\u8170\u75db\uff0c\u865b\u6eff\u524d\u9589\u8b6b\u8a00\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\uff1b\u4e09\u9670\u4ff1\u9006\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u524d\u5f8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u624b\u8db3\u5bd2\uff0c\u4e09\u65e5\u6b7b\u3002\u592a\u967d\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u50f5\u4ec6\u5614\u8840\u5584\u8842\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\uff1b\u5c11\u967d\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u6a5f\u95dc\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u6a5f\u95dc\u4e0d\u5229\u8005\uff0c\u8170\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u884c\uff0c\u9805\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u9867\uff0c\u767c\u8178\u7670\u4e0d\u53ef\u6cbb\u9a5a\u8005\u6b7b\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u53a5\u9006\u5598\u6b2c\u8eab\u71b1\uff0c\u5584\u9a5a\u8842\u5614\u8840\u3002\u624b\u592a\u9670\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u865b\u6eff\u800c\u6b2c\uff0c\u5584\u5614\u6cab\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\uff1b\u624b\u5fc3\u4e3b\u5c11\u9670\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u5fc3\u75db\u5f15\u5589\u8eab\u71b1\u6b7b\u4e0d\u53ef\u6cbb\u3002\u624b\u592a\u967d\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u8033\u807e\u6ce3\u51fa\uff0c\u9805\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u9867\uff0c\u8170\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdb\u4ef0\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\uff1b\u624b\u967d\u660e\u5c11\u967d\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u767c\u5589\u75fa\uff0c\u55cc\u816b\u75d3\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u8005\u3002 Emperor said: Good. I wish to hear about the six classic meridians and their pathological disorders.

Mastering the classics refers to understanding the flow of qi throughout heaven, while mastering the lower classics refers to understanding the changes in disease.

The constant ones refer to managing strange diseases so that they do not lead to death during the four seasons, while odd ones are able to cause death at the four seasons. Regarding the odd, it prevents strange diseases from causing death during the four seasons; regarding the constant, one can cause death at the four seasons.

The Duke said, The fetal cord attaches to the kidney, the source of the yin essence, passing through the kidney and connecting to the tongue. Therefore, one cannot speak. Emperor Yellow asked, What is the treatment for this? The Duke said, There is no cure; it will resolve by itself in the tenth month. Acupuncture says, It is a condition without damage or excess. Treatment consists of promoting the body's natural healing abilities by reinforcing the deficiency and allowing the rash to develop fully before addressing it. The term 'without damage or excess' refers to a weakened body that does not require the use of jade stones. In this case, there is an internal mass within the abdomen that is expelled, leading to the expulsion of essence and the disease becoming entrenched in the body, causing the rash.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u8107\u4e0b\u6eff\u6c23\u9006\uff0c\u4e8c\u4e09\u6b72\u4e0d\u5df2\uff0c\u662f\u70ba\u4f55\u75c5\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u540d\u66f0\u606f\u7a4d\uff0c\u6b64\u4e0d\u59a8\u65bc\u98df\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u7078\u523a\uff0c\u7a4d\u70ba\u5c0e\u5f15\u670d\u85e5\uff0c\u85e5\u4e0d\u80fd\u7368\u6cbb\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said: This illness causes a fullness and reversal below the ribs, lasting for days in children aged two or three.

What is it called, and how does one get it? Duke of Zhou: This is an excess of the Five Qi, known as the spleen. When the five flavors enter the mouth, they are stored in the stomach. The spleen moves the vital energy, and fluids reside in the spleen, thereby causing a person's mouth to taste bitter. This is the source of being overweight and enjoying sweet things; such people have eaten many sweet and rich foods, leading them to become overweight. Being overweight causes internal heat, and sweetness causes a feeling of fullness. As a result, their vital energy rises in excess, leading to thirst. Treatment involves using orchid (\u862d) to disperse stagnant qi.</p> <p>7: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u75c5\u53e3\u82e6\uff0c\u53d6\u967d\u9675\u6cc9\uff0c\u53e3\u82e6\u8005\u75c5\u540d\u70ba\u4f55\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u5f97\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u540d\u66f0\u81bd\u7649\u3002\u592b\u809d\u8005\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5c07\u4e5f\uff0c\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u81bd\uff0c\u54bd\u70ba\u4e4b\u4f7f\u3002\u6b64\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u6578\u8b00\u616e\u4e0d\u6c7a\uff0c\u6545\u81bd\u865b\u6c23\u4e0a\u6ea2\uff0c\u800c\u53e3\u70ba\u4e4b\u82e6\u3002\u6cbb\u4e4b\u4ee5\u81bd\u52df\u4fde\uff0c\u6cbb\u5728\u9670\u967d\u5341\u4e8c\u5b98\u76f8\u4f7f\u4e2d\u3002 Emperor: There is a person with a painful sore throat. They have taken water from Yangling Spring, yet the pain in their throat persists. What is this person's condition called, and how did they contract it? Minister Qi replied: The condition is called gallbladder confluence. The liver sends out a message, and the gallbladder responds by concentrating it. This person has been pondering and worrying for some time without making any decisions, which has caused their gallbladder to become deficient in Qi, causing it to rise upwards, resulting in throat pain. The treatment is to strengthen the gallbladder with Gui Piao, and the remedy lies in the communication between the Yin and Yang of the Twelve Organ Networks.</p> <p>8: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u7643\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u65e5\u6578\u5341\u6eb2\uff0c\u6b64\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e5f\uff1b\u8eab\u71b1\u5982\u70ad\uff0c\u9838\u81ba\u5982\u683c\uff0c\u4eba\u8fce\u8e81\u76db\uff0c\u5598\u606f\u6c23\u9006\uff0c\u6b64\u6709\u9918\u4e5f\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u8108\u5fae\u7d30\u5982\u9aee\u8005\uff0c\u6b64\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e5f\u3002\u5176\u75c5\u5b89\u5728\uff0c\u540d\u70ba\u4f55\u75c5\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u5728\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u5176\u76db\u5728\u80c3\u9817\u5728\u80ba\uff0c\u75c5\u540d\u66f0\u53a5\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\u3002\u6b64\u6240\u8b02\u5f97\u4e94\u6709\u9918\u4e8c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u4e94\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u4e8c\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6240\u8b02\u4e94\u6709\u9918\u8005\u4e94\u75c5\u4e4b\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e8c\u4e0d\u8db3\u8005\uff0c\u4ea6\u75c5\u6c23\u4e4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e5f\u3002\u4eca\u5916\u5f97\u4e94\u6709\u9918\u5167\u5f97\u4e8c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6b64\u5176\u8eab\u4e0d\u8868\u4e0d\u88cf\uff0c\u4ea6\u6b63\u6b7b\u660e\u77e3\u3002 The emperor said: Someone has symptoms where they are ill for a day or two with fever, and this is not enough.

Huo Bo said: The five excesses refer to having excess energy in the five diseases, while the two deficiencies refer to a lack of energy in the diseases.

If the disease is vacuity and affects the foot, it is because solar qi has dissolved earth qi as it emerges in the first month, and vacuity diseases are more common in winter. Therefore, vacuity results in a limping gait. The case of strong upward-pulling and bending of the back is due to an excess of solar qi contending [with yin qi] above, resulting in strong upward-pulling and bending of the back. Tinnitus, meaning that solar qi is abundant in all things and leaping, results in tinnitus. The case of wild and raving restlessness is due to solar qi being fully present above while yin qi ascends from below; with emptiness below and fullness above, this results in wild and raving restlessness. Floating leading to deafness is all due to qi. Entering the center leads to stiffness, which occurs when solar qi has reached its peak and then declines, resulting in stiffness. Internal theft results in collapse, leading to stiffness; this is a deficiency of the kidney [organ]. Inadequate nourishment from the kidneys results in collapse, manifesting as stiffness and numbness; this is due to deficient yin.</p> <p>2: \u5c11\u967d\u6240\u8b02\u5fc3\u8107\u75db\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u5c11\u967d\u76db\u4e5f\uff0c\u76db\u8005\u5fc3\u4e4b\u6240\u8868\u4e5f\u3002\u4e5d\u6708\u967d\u6c23\u76e1\u800c\u9670\u6c23\u76db\uff0c\u6545\u5fc3\u8107\u75db\u4e5f\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u4e0d\u53ef\u53cd\u5074\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u85cf\u7269\u4e5f\uff0c\u7269\u85cf\u5247\u4e0d\u52d5\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u53ef\u53cd\u5074\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u751a\u5247\u8e8d\u8005\uff0c\u4e5d\u6708\u842c\u7269\u76e1\u8870\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u7562\u843d\u800c\u58ae\uff0c\u5247\u6c23\u53bb\u967d\u800c\u4e4b\u9670\uff0c\u6c23\u76db\u800c\u967d\u4e4b\u4e0b\u9577\uff0c\u6545\u8b02\u8e8d\u3002 Of those who are said to have heart and flank pain due to Shao Yang, this refers to the excess of Shao Yang. The excess is what the heart expresses. In September, yang qi is exhausted and yin qi is abundant, so there is heart and flank pain, which means that one cannot turn over. Yin qi governs storage, and when it stores something, it does not move, thus one cannot turn over. When it reaches the extreme and leaps, in September all things have waned and grass and trees have fallen, so the yang has dissipated and the yin has accumulated, causing it to grow below the yang, hence it is said to leap</p> <p>3: \u967d\u660e\u6240\u8b02\u6d12\u6d12\u632f\u5bd2\u8005\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u8005\uff0c\u5348\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e94\u6708\u76db\u967d\u4e4b\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u76db\u800c\u9670\u6c23\u52a0\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u6d12\u6d12\u632f\u5bd2\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u811b\u816b\u800c\u80a1\u4e0d\u6536\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u4e94\u6708\u76db\u967d\u4e4b\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u8005\u8870\u65bc\u4e94\u6708\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u9670\u6c23\u4e0a\uff0c\u8207\u967d\u59cb\u722d\uff0c\u6545\u811b\u816b\u800c\u80a1\u4e0d\u6536\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u4e0a\u5598\u800c\u70ba\u6c34\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u4e0b\u800c\u5fa9\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0a\u5247\u90aa\u5ba2\u65bc\u85cf\u5e9c\u9593\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u6c34\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u80f8\u75db\u5c11\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u6c34\u6c23\u5728\u85cf\u5e9c\u4e5f\uff0c\u6c34\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u4e5f\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u5728\u4e2d\uff0c\u6545\u80f8\u75db\u5c11\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u751a\u5247\u53a5\u60e1\u4eba\u8207\u706b\uff0c\u805e\u6728\u97f3\u5247\u60d5\u7136\u800c\u9a5a\u8005\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u8207\u9670\u6c23\u76f8\u8584\uff0c\u6c34\u706b\u76f8\u60e1\uff0c\u6545\u60d5\u7136\u800c\u9a5a\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u6b32\u7368\u9589\u6236\u7256\u800c\u8655\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u8584\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u76e1\u800c\u9670\u76db\uff0c\u6545\u6b32\u7368\u9589\u6236\u7256\u800c\u5c45\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u75c5\u81f3\u5247\u6b32\u4e58\u9ad8\u800c\u6b4c\uff0c\u68c4\u8863\u800c\u8d70\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u5fa9\u722d\uff0c\u800c\u5916\u5e76\u65bc\u967d\uff0c\u6545\u4f7f\u4e4b\u68c4\u8863\u800c\u8d70\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u5ba2\u5b6b\u8108\u5247\u982d\u75db\u9f3b\u9f3d\u8179\u816b\u8005\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u5176\u5b6b\u7d61\u592a\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u982d\u75db\u9f3b\u9f3d\u8179\u816b\u4e5f\u3002 On the Yangming theory of chilling and warmth:  Yangming refers to the refreshing and warming energy. Yangming is the energy in the middle hour (noon) of the fifth solar term, which is when the yang energy is at its peak. When the yang energy is strong and the yin energy arrives, it causes a refreshing and cooling sensation. </p> <p>On the condition of knee swelling but thighs not receding: This is also related to the yin energy in the fifth solar term when the yang energy starts to decline. As the yang energy wanes in the fifth solar term, the yin energy surges upwards and competes with the yang energy, causing knee swelling and thighs that do not recede. </p> <p>On the condition of shortness of breath and feeling of suffocation: The yin energy has descended but then rises again, causing disruption in the lower abdomen where vital organs are located, leading to shortness of breath and a feeling of suffocation.</p> <p>On the condition of chest pain and weakness: The yin energy is present in the lower abdomen, where vital organs are located, and hence the chest pain and weakness. </p> <p>On the phenomenon of being shocked and frightened by sudden loud noises: The yang and yin energies are out of balance, and water and fire are at odds with each other, causing one to be startled and frightened by sudden loud noises.</p> <p>On the condition of wanting to be alone and closing oneself off: The yin and yang energies are out of balance, and when the yang energy is depleted and the yin energy is in excess, it leads to a desire for solitude and closure. </p> <p>On the condition of wanting to sing and climb high during illness: The yin and yang energies are competing, with the external force leaning towards the yang energy, leading to the desire to sing and climb high during illness. </p> <p>On the phenomenon of Toung-Chi (client's grandson) pulse and headache, nasal congestion, and abdominal distension: The Yangming energy is present in the upper body, where the grandson pulse is located. The presence of the grandson pulse indicates an imbalance of yin and yang energies, leading to headache, nasal congestion, and abdominal distension.</p> <p>4: \u592a\u9670\u6240\u8b02\u75c5\u8139\u8005\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u5b50\u4e5f\uff0c\u5341\u4e00\u6708\u842c\u7269\u6c23\u7686\u85cf\u65bc\u4e2d\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u75c5\u8139\uff1b\u6240\u8b02\u4e0a\u8d70\u5fc3\u70ba\u566b\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u76db\u800c\u4e0a\u8d70\u65bc\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u7d61\u5c6c\u5fc3\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u4e0a\u8d70\u5fc3\u70ba\u566b\u4e5f\uff1b\u6240\u8b02\u98df\u5247\u5614\u8005\uff0c\u7269\u76db\u6eff\u800c\u4e0a\u6ea2\uff0c\u6545\u5614\u4e5f\uff1b\u6240\u8b02\u5f97\u5f8c\u8207\u6c23\u5247\u5feb\u7136\u5982\u8870\u8005\uff0c\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u9670\u6c23\u4e0b\u8870\uff0c\u800c\u967d\u6c23\u4e14\u51fa\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5f97\u5f8c\u8207\u6c23\u5247\u5feb\u7136\u5982\u8870\u4e5f\u3002 Regarding the becoming full illness of the Yin: This refers to the Yin itself, as in the eleventh month, the Qi of all things is stored within it.

In the tenth lunar month, all creatures' Yang Qi is injured, hence the lower back pain. As for those who experience nausea and shortness of breath upon rising, the Yin Qi is below and the Yang Qi is above, with the Yang Qi floating without anything to support it, resulting in nausea and shortness of breath. Regarding those who cannot maintain their posture due to a deficiency of Yin and Yang, no one has ever governed the myriad creatures' Yin and Yang. When autumn energy arrives and the first frost falls, it kills all creatures, with the Yin and Yang of all creatures not yet stabilized and without a governor, causing them to lose their posture and not be able to see anything upon standing up. Regarding those who become easily angered due to a deficiency of Qi, the Yang Qi is disordered; since the Yang Qi is not discharged, the Liver Qi cannot regulate, leading to easy anger, which is known as Shan Jue. Regarding those who are afraid like someone about to be captured, the autumn energy has not yet completed its disappearance, with Yin deficient and Yang rising; Yin and Yang are insufficiently balanced, causing fear. Regarding those who dislike hearing sound and smell odor, the Stomach lacks Qi, so they dislike hearing sounds and smelling odors. Regarding those whose faces become black like the color of soil, the autumn energy has invaded internally, causing a change in their appearance. Regarding those who cough with blood when they exhale, it is damage to the Yang Meridian, with the Yang Qi not yet flourishing above and the pulse full; when full, there is coughing, and so blood appears at the nostrils.</p> <p>6: \u53a5\u9670\u6240\u8b02\u3fc9\u759d\u5a66\u4eba\u5c11\u8179\u816b\u8005\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u8fb0\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e09\u6708\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\u90aa\u5728\u4e2d\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u3fc9\u759d\u5c11\u8179\u816b\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u8170\u810a\u75db\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdb\u4ef0\u8005\uff0c\u4e09\u6708\u4e00\u632f\u69ae\u83ef\u842c\u7269\uff0c\u4e00\u4fdb\u800c\u4e0d\u4ef0\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u3fc9\u7643\u759d\u819a\u8139\u8005\uff0c\u66f0\u9670\u4ea6\u76db\u800c\u8108\u8139\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u3fc9\u7643\u759d\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u751a\u5247\u55cc\u4e7e\u71b1\u4e2d\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u8584\u800c\u71b1\uff0c\u6545\u55cc\u4e7e\u4e5f\u3002 Regarding the so-called pubic swelling of women with less abdomen, it is the Yin (kidneys) that is involved, and the Three Yin Evil in the middle of the third lunar month. Therefore, it is called pubic swelling and slight abdominal distension. As for the so-called lower back pain that cannot be cured by bending forward, the third lunar month is a time of one shaking honor and glory for all things, bending forward but not bending backward. Regarding the so-called pubic rash, it means that the Yin (kidneys) is also abundant but the pulse is not well circulated, hence it is called pubic rash. As for the case of extreme heat and dryness in the urethra, the Yin and Yang are weak and there is heat, which causes the urethra to dry up.</p>"},{"location":"4_huangdi-neijing_jin-gui-zhen-yan-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u91d1\u5331\u771f\u8a00\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u6709\u516b\u98a8\uff0c\u7d93\u6709\u4e94\u98a8\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u516b\u98a8\u767c\u90aa\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u7d93\u98a8\uff0c\u89f8\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u767c\u75c5\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u5f97\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u52dd\u8005\uff0c\u6625\u52dd\u9577\u590f\uff0c\u9577\u590f\u52dd\u51ac\uff0c\u51ac\u52dd\u590f\uff0c\u590f\u52dd\u79cb\uff0c\u79cb\u52dd\u6625\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u52dd\u4e5f\u3002\u6771\u98a8\u751f\u65bc\u6625\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u809d\uff0c\u4fde\u5728\u9838\u9805\uff1b\u5357\u98a8\u751f\u65bc\u590f\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u5fc3\uff0c\u4fde\u5728\u80f8\u8107\uff1b\u897f\u98a8\u751f\u65bc\u79cb\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u80ba\uff0c\u4fde\u5728\u80a9\u80cc\uff1b\u5317\u98a8\u751f\u65bc\u51ac\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u814e\uff0c\u4fde\u5728\u8170\u80a1\uff1b\u4e2d\u592e\u70ba\u571f\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u813e\uff1b\u4fde\u5728\u810a\u3002\u6545\u6625\u6c23\u8005\u75c5\u5728\u982d\uff0c\u590f\u6c23\u8005\u75c5\u5728\u85cf\uff0c\u79cb\u6c23\u8005\u75c5\u5728\u80a9\u80cc\uff0c\u51ac\u6c23\u8005\u75c5\u5728\u56db\u652f\u3002\u6545\u6625\u5584\u75c5\u9f3d\u8844\uff0c\u4ef2\u590f\u5584\u75c5\u80f8\u8107\uff0c\u9577\u590f\u5584\u75c5\u6d1e\u6cc4\u5bd2\u4e2d\uff0c\u79cb\u5584\u75c5\u98a8\u7627\uff0c\u51ac\u5584\u75c5\u75fa\u53a5\u3002\u6545\u51ac\u4e0d\u6309\u8e7b\uff0c\u6625\u4e0d\u9f3d\u8844\uff0c\u6625\u4e0d\u75c5\u9838\u9805\uff0c\u4ef2\u590f\u4e0d\u75c5\u80f8\u8107\uff0c\u9577\u590f\u4e0d\u75c5\u6d1e\u6cc4\u5bd2\u4e2d\uff0c\u79cb\u4e0d\u75c5\u98a8\u7627\uff0c\u51ac\u4e0d\u75c5\u75fa\u53a5\u98f1\u6cc4\uff0c\u800c\u6c57\u51fa\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u7cbe\u8005\u8eab\u4e4b\u672c\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u85cf\u65bc\u7cbe\u8005\u6625\u4e0d\u75c5\u6eab\u3002\u590f\u6691\u6c57\u4e0d\u51fa\u8005\uff0c\u79cb\u6210\u98a8\u7627\u3002\u6b64\u5e73\u4eba\u8108\u6cd5\u4e5f\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked, There are eight winds in heaven and five winds in the Classic of Changes. What do they mean? The Duke answered, The eight winds emit pathogenic factors, which are called the winds of the Classic of Changes. They strike the Five Organs, causing pathogenic Qi to give rise to diseases. Those who master the seasons will know which one triumphs over the others: spring triumphs over long summer, long summer triumphs over winter, winter triumphs over summer, and summer triumphs over autumn, and autumn triumphs over spring. This is known as the triumph of the four seasons. The east wind arises in spring, affecting the liver and knotting at the neck and jaw; the south wind arises in summer, affecting the heart and knotting at the chest and back; the west wind arises in autumn, affecting the lungs and knotting at the shoulder and back; and the north wind arises in winter, affecting the kidneys and knotting at the hips. The center is Earth, affecting the spleen and knotting at the spine. Therefore, diseases of Qi in spring affect the head; those of summer affect the abdomen; those of autumn affect the shoulder blades; and those of winter affect the limbs. Hence, spring is prone to skin eruptions, summer is prone to chest disorders, long summer is prone to diarrhea and cold damage, autumn is prone to windstroke, and winter is prone to numbness and paralysis. Consequently, one should not suppress urges in winter, nor indulge in skin eruptions in spring, nor suffer from neck and jaw pain in spring, nor chest disorders in summer, nor diarrhea and cold damage in long summer, nor windstroke in autumn, nor numbness and paralysis in winter. When the latter does occur, one should sweat it out, which is known as the Plain people's pulse method.</p> <p>2: \u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u4e2d\u6709\u9670\uff0c\u967d\u4e2d\u6709\u967d\u3002\u5e73\u65e6\u81f3\u65e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\u4e5f\uff1b\u65e5\u4e2d\u81f3\u9ec3\u660f\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\u4e5f\uff1b\u5408\u591c\u81f3\u96de\u9cf4\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\u4e5f\uff1b\u96de\u9cf4\u81f3\u5e73\u65e6\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u4eba\u4ea6\u61c9\u4e4b\u3002\u592b\u8a00\u4eba\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5247\u5916\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u5167\u70ba\u9670\u3002\u8a00\u4eba\u8eab\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5247\u80cc\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u8179\u70ba\u9670\u3002\u8a00\u4eba\u8eab\u4e4b\u85cf\u5e9c\u4e2d\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5247\u85cf\u8005\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u5e9c\u8005\u70ba\u967d\u3002\u809d\u5fc3\u813e\u80ba\u814e\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u7686\u70ba\u9670\u3002\u81bd\u80c3\u5927\u8178\u5c0f\u8178\u8180\u80f1\u4e09\u7126\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u7686\u70ba\u967d\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6b32\u77e5\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\uff0c\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\u8005\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u70ba\u51ac\u75c5\u5728\u9670\uff0c\u590f\u75c5\u5728\u967d\uff0c\u6625\u75c5\u5728\u9670\uff0c\u79cb\u75c5\u5728\u967d\uff0c\u7686\u8996\u5176\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u70ba\u65bd\u937c\u77f3\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u80cc\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\uff0c\u5fc3\u4e5f\uff1b\u80cc\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\uff0c\u80ba\u4e5f\uff1b\u8179\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\uff0c\u814e\u4e5f\uff1b\u8179\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\uff0c\u809d\u4e5f\uff1b\u8179\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u81f3\u9670\uff0c\u813e\u4e5f\u3002\u6b64\u7686\u9670\u967d\u8868\u88cf\u5167\u5916\u96cc\u96c4\u76f8\u8f38\u61c9\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u4ee5\u61c9\u5929\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\u3002 Thus it is said: Within Yin there is Yin, within Yang there is Yang. At dawn, the sun's Yang is the Yang within Yang; at noon, the sun's Yang is the Yang within Yin; at the crowing of the cock, the sun's Yin is the Yin within Yin; and from the crowing of the cock to dawn, the sun's Yin is the Yin within Yang. Therefore, humans should follow this pattern. As for human Yin and Yang, the outside is Yang and the inside is Yin. As for the Yin and Yang of the human body, the back is Yang and the front is Yin. As for the Yin and Yang of the body's storage chambers, the stored element is Yin and the chamber is Yang. The five organs of storage\u2014liver, heart, spleen, lung, and kidney\u2014are all Yin. The six fu organs of the three burners\u2014gallbladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, and triple burner\u2014are all Yang. So, how does one know the Yin within Yin and the Yang within Yang? Treat winter diseases as being in the Yin, summer diseases as being in the Yang, spring diseases as being in the Yin, and autumn diseases as being in the Yang, all depending on where they are located. Therefore, the back is Yang, the Yang within Yang, which is the heart; the back is Yang, the Yang within Yin, which is the lung; the abdomen is Yin, the Yin within Yin, which is the kidney; the abdomen is Yin, the Yin within Yang, which is the liver; and the abdomen is Yin, the Yin within the utmost Yin, which is the spleen. All of these demonstrate the interplay between Yin and Yang in the human body's exterior and interior, as well as the male and female aspects, so humans should follow this pattern to correspond with heaven's Yin and Yang.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u85cf\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6536\u53d7\u4e4e\uff0c\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u3002\u6771\u65b9\u9752\u8272\uff0c\u5165\u901a\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u958b\u7ac5\u65bc\u76ee\uff0c\u85cf\u7cbe\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u767c\u9a5a\u99ed\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u9178\uff0c\u5176\u985e\u8349\u6728\uff0c\u5176\u755c\u96de\uff0c\u5176\u7a40\u9ea5\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u4e0a\u70ba\u6b72\u661f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u6625\u6c23\u5728\u982d\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u97f3\u89d2\uff0c\u5176\u6578\u516b\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u77e5\u75c5\u4e4b\u5728\u7b4b\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u81ed\u81ca\u3002\u5357\u65b9\u8d64\u8272\uff0c\u5165\u901a\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u958b\u7ac5\u65bc\u8033\uff0c\u85cf\u7cbe\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u6545\u75c5\u5728\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u82e6\uff0c\u5176\u985e\u706b\uff0c\u5176\u755c\u7f8a\uff0c\u5176\u7a40\u9ecd\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u4e0a\u70ba\u7192\u60d1\u661f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u77e5\u75c5\u4e4b\u5728\u8108\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u97f3\u5fb5\uff0c\u5176\u6578\u4e03\uff0c\u5176\u81ed\u7126\u3002\u4e2d\u592e\u9ec3\u8272\uff0c\u5165\u901a\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u958b\u7ac5\u65bc\u53e3\uff0c\u85cf\u7cbe\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u6545\u75c5\u5728\u820c\u672c\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u7518\uff0c\u5176\u985e\u571f\uff0c\u5176\u755c\u725b\uff0c\u5176\u7a40\u7a37\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u4e0a\u70ba\u93ae\u661f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u77e5\u75c5\u4e4b\u5728\u8089\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u97f3\u5bae\uff0c\u5176\u6578\u4e94\uff0c\u5176\u81ed\u9999\u3002\u897f\u65b9\u767d\u8272\uff0c\u5165\u901a\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u958b\u7ac5\u65bc\u9f3b\uff0c\u85cf\u7cbe\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u6545\u75c5\u5728\u80cc\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u8f9b\uff0c\u5176\u985e\u91d1\uff0c\u5176\u755c\u99ac\uff0c\u5176\u7a40\u7a3b\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u4e0a\u70ba\u592a\u767d\u661f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u77e5\u75c5\u4e4b\u5728\u76ae\u6bdb\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u97f3\u5546\uff0c\u5176\u6578\u4e5d\uff0c\u5176\u81ed\u8165\u3002\u5317\u65b9\u9ed1\u8272\uff0c\u5165\u901a\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u958b\u7ac5\u65bc\u4e8c\u9670\uff0c\u85cf\u7cbe\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u6545\u75c5\u5728\u8c3f\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u9e79\uff0c\u5176\u985e\u6c34\uff0c\u5176\u755c\u5f58\uff0c\u5176\u7a40\u8c46\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u4e0a\u70ba\u8fb0\u661f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u77e5\u75c5\u4e4b\u5728\u9aa8\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u97f3\u7fbd\uff0c\u5176\u6578\u516d\uff0c\u5176\u81ed\u8150\u3002\u6545\u5584\u70ba\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u8b39\u5bdf\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u4e00\u9006\u4e00\u5f9e\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u8868\u88cf\uff0c\u96cc\u96c4\u4e4b\u7d00\uff0c\u85cf\u4e4b\u5fc3\u610f\uff0c\u5408\u5fc3\u65bc\u7cbe\uff0c\u975e\u5176\u4eba\u52ff\u6559\uff0c\u975e\u5176\u771f\u52ff\u6388\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5f97\u9053\u3002 The emperor said: The five viscera correspond to the four seasons, each having their own function. Duke Mu replied: Yes. The eastern color is green, it enters through the liver, opens the orifices of the eyes, stores the essence in the liver, and when there is disease, it manifests as shock and fright; its flavor is sour, its category is grasses, its birds are chickens, its grains are wheat, its season corresponds to the four seasons, above it is the seasonal star, so spring qi is in the head, its sound is jiao, its number is eight, thus knowing the disease is in the sinews.</p> <p>The southern color is red, it enters through the heart, opens the orifices of the ears, stores the essence in the heart, so the disease is in the five viscera, its flavor is bitter, its category is fire, its animals are sheep, its grains are millet, its season corresponds to the stars, above it is the planetary star, thus knowing the disease is in the pulse, its sound is zhi, its number is seven, its smell is burnt.</p> <p>The central color is yellow, it enters through the spleen, opens the orifices of the mouth, stores the essence in the spleen, so the disease is in the tongue origin, its flavor is sweet, its category is earth, its animals are oxen, its grains are millet, its season corresponds to the four seasons, above it is the star of tranquility, thus knowing the disease is in the flesh, its sound is gong, its number is five, its smell is fragrant.</p> <p>The western color is white, it enters through the lungs, opens the orifices of the nose, stores the essence in the lungs, so the disease is in the back, its flavor is spicy, its category is metal, its animals are horses, its grains are millet, its season corresponds to the four seasons, above it is the star of the celestial terminator, thus knowing the disease is in the skin and hair, its sound is shang, its number is nine, its smell is fetid.</p> <p>The northern color is black, it enters through the kidneys, opens the orifices of the two yin channels, stores the essence in the kidneys, so the disease is in the channels, its flavor is salty, its category is water, its animals are donkeys, its grains are beans, its season corresponds to the four seasons, above it is the star of the celestial stem, thus knowing the disease is in the bones, its sound is yi, its number is six, its smell is putrid.</p> <p>Therefore, skilled in pulse diagnosis should carefully examine the five viscera and their six organs, one reversing and one following, yin and yang, exterior and interior, recording the female and male records, storing the essence in the heart-mind, combining the heart-mind with the essence, not teaching others unless one is skilled, not granting unless one is true - this is attaining the way.</p>"},{"location":"50_huangdi-neijing_ci-yao-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u523a\u8981\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u523a\u8981\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u6709\u6d6e\u6c88\uff0c\u523a\u6709\u6dfa\u6df1\uff0c\u5404\u81f3\u5176\u7406\uff0c\u7121\u904e\u5176\u9053\uff1b\u904e\u4e4b\u5247\u5167\u50b7\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ca\u5247\u751f\u5916\u58c5\uff0c\u58c5\u5247\u90aa\u5f9e\u4e4b\u3002\u6dfa\u6df1\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u53cd\u70ba\u5927\u8cca\uff0c\u5167\u52d5\u4e94\u85cf\u5f8c\u751f\u5927\u75c5\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u6709\u5728\u6beb\u6bdb\u8160\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5728\u76ae\u819a\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5728\u808c\u8089\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5728\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5728\u7b4b\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5728\u9aa8\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5728\u9ad3\u8005\u3002\u662f\u6545\u523a\u6beb\u6bdb\u8160\u7406\uff0c\u7121\u50b7\u76ae\uff0c\u76ae\u50b7\u5247\u5167\u52d5\u80ba\uff0c\u80ba\u52d5\u5247\u79cb\u75c5\u6eab\u7627\uff0c\u6cdd\u6cdd\u7136\u5bd2\u6144\uff1b\u523a\u76ae\uff0c\u7121\u50b7\u8089\uff0c\u8089\u50b7\u5247\u5167\u52d5\u813e\uff0c\u813e\u52d5\u5247\u4e03\u5341\u4e8c\u65e5\u56db\u5b63\u4e4b\u6708\uff0c\u75c5\u8179\u8139\u7169\uff0c\u4e0d\u55dc\u98df\uff1b\u523a\u8089\uff0c\u7121\u50b7\u8108\uff0c\u8108\u50b7\u5247\u5167\u52d5\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u52d5\u5247\u590f\u75c5\u5fc3\u75db\uff1b\u523a\u8108\uff0c\u7121\u50b7\u7b4b\uff0c\u7b4b\u50b7\u5247\u5167\u52d5\u809d\uff0c\u809d\u52d5\u5247\u6625\u75c5\u71b1\u800c\u7b4b\u5f1b\uff1b\u523a\u7b4b\u7121\u50b7\u9aa8\uff0c\u9aa8\u50b7\u5247\u5167\u52d5\u814e\uff0c\u814e\u52d5\u5247\u51ac\u75c5\u8139\u8170\u75db\uff1b\u523a\u9aa8\uff0c\u7121\u50b7\u9ad3\uff0c\u9ad3\u50b7\u5247\u92b7\u9460\uff0c\u80fb\u9178\uff0c\u9ad4\u89e3\u344a\u7136\u4e0d\u53bb\u77e3\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked, I would like to hear about acupuncture. Tong Fahui replied, Disease has a floating and sinking sensation, and acupuncture has shallow and deep insertion. Each one should be at its proper level without exceeding its limits; otherwise, it will cause internal injury, not reaching the appropriate depth will cause external obstruction, and obstruction will lead to the invasion of evil qi. If shallow and deep cannot be controlled, it becomes a great danger, causing internal movement of the five zang organs and leading to serious disease. Thus, disease can be in the hair follicles, skin, muscles, vessels, tendons, and bones. Therefore, acupuncture the hair follicles without harming the skin; if the skin is harmed, it will cause internal movement of the lung, leading to autumn diseases of fever and chills. If you acupuncture the skin without harming the muscles, but the muscles are harmed, it will cause internal movement of the spleen, leading to diseases occurring every seventy-two days in all four seasons, abdominal distension and discomfort, and lack of appetite. Acupuncture the muscles without harming the vessels; if the vessels are harmed, it will cause internal movement of the heart, leading to summer diseases of heart pain. If you acupuncture the vessels without harming the tendons, but the tendons are harmed, it will cause internal movement of the liver, leading to spring diseases of fever and tendon weakness. Acupuncture the tendons without harming the bones; if the bones are harmed, it will cause internal movement of the kidney, leading to winter diseases of lower back pain. If you acupuncture the bones without harming the marrow, but the marrow is harmed, it will lead to waste and body aches that do not go away.</p>"},{"location":"51_huangdi-neijing_ci-qi-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u523a\u9f4a\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u523a\u6dfa\u6df1\u4e4b\u5206\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u9aa8\u8005\u7121\u50b7\u7b4b\uff0c\u523a\u7b4b\u8005\u7121\u50b7\u8089\uff0c\u523a\u8089\u8005\u7121\u50b7\u8108\uff0c\u523a\u8108\u8005\u7121\u50b7\u76ae\uff0c\u523a\u76ae\u8005\u7121\u50b7\u8089\uff0c\u523a\u8089\u8005\u7121\u50b7\u7b4b\uff0c\u523a\u7b4b\u8005\u7121\u50b7\u9aa8\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked, I would like to hear about the distinction between shallow and deep needling.

When piercing the tendon without injuring the flesh, you must remove it before reaching the tendon. When piercing the flesh without injuring the blood vessel, you must remove it before reaching the flesh. When piercing the blood vessel without injuring the skin, you must remove it before reaching the blood vessel. To pierce the skin without injuring the flesh means that the disease is in the skin, and by entering the skin, you do not harm the flesh. Piercing the flesh without injuring the tendon indicates that there is a problem with the tendon within the flesh. Piercing the tendon without injuring the bone indicates that there is a problem with the bone within the tendon.

Guanpu answered, Sticking the real, it becomes virtual; the needle penetrates heat, and the qi is real. Filling and discharging it, the needle penetrates cold, and the qi is virtual. Dispersing and eliminating, expelling evil blood, remove the needle. When the pathogenic factor prevails in the virtual, do not press the needle. Gradually pressing the real, quickly press the needle; quickly pressing the virtual, gradually press the needle. Speaking of real and virtual, it is a matter of the amount of qi being hot or cold. If there is none or if there is, it is difficult to know how fast or slow. Discern the later and earlier, knowing the order of disease progression. For the real and virtual, do not fail to use the method. When obtaining or losing it, separate from the method. The essence of real and virtual, the supreme skill of the nine needles, each has its own way to apply. Supplementing and opening at the time, correspond with qi's opening and closing. The name of the nine needles, each having a different shape, exhausts the needles according to what should be supplemented and opened.</p> <p>2: \u523a\u5be6\u9808\u5176\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u7559\u937c\u9670\u6c23\u9686\u81f3\uff0c\u4e43\u53bb\u937c\u4e5f\u3002\u523a\u865b\u9808\u5176\u5be6\u8005\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u9686\u81f3\uff0c\u937c\u4e0b\u71b1\u4e43\u53bb\u937c\u4e5f\u3002\u7d93\u6c23\u5df2\u81f3\uff0c\u614e\u5b88\u52ff\u5931\u8005\uff0c\u52ff\u8b8a\u66f4\u4e5f\u3002\u6df1\u6dfa\u5728\u5fd7\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u75c5\u4e4b\u5167\u5916\u4e5f\u3002\u8fd1\u9060\u5982\u4e00\u8005\uff0c\u6df1\u6dfa\u5176\u5019\u7b49\u4e5f\u3002\u5982\u81e8\u6df1\u6df5\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u6562\u58af\u4e5f\u3002\u624b\u5982\u63e1\u864e\u8005\uff0c\u6b32\u5176\u58ef\u4e5f\u3002\u795e\u7121\u71df\u65bc\u773e\u7269\u8005\uff0c\u975c\u5fd7\u89c0\u75c5\u4eba\u7121\u5de6\u53f3\u8996\u4e5f\u3002\u7fa9\u7121\u90aa\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u6b32\u7aef\u4ee5\u6b63\u4e5f\u3002\u5fc5\u6b63\u5176\u795e\u8005\uff0c\u6b32\u77bb\u75c5\u4eba\u76ee\u5236\u5176\u795e\uff0c\u4ee4\u6c23\u6613\u884c\u4e5f\u3002 The needle must penetrate the virtual aspect, leaving the subtle energy to rise fully. When the needle penetrates the real aspect, the vital energy descends and the needle is removed. Be careful when the energy has arrived, and do not change or alter anything. Know the shallow and deep aspects of the disease, as well as its external and internal manifestations. Treat the near and far equally, and balance the timing of your approach. When faced with a difficult case, be cautious and hesitant. Hold the needle as if grasping a tiger, wishing for strength. Be free from distractions and maintain focus on the patient. Uphold righteousness without deviation, seeking to align the mind with the truth.

I wish to learn about this method. Chi Po replied: To know about the division of the skin using channels and networks as reference is taught in all the classics. The Yang Ming's yang, named Hui Gui, has similar laws above and below, observe its part for any floating or swollen areas, these are all the floating networks of Yang Ming. If its color is predominantly blue, there is pain; if predominantly black, there is paralysis; if red or yellow, there is fever; if white, there is cold. With the five colors seen, this indicates cold and heat. When there is an abundance of floating networks, they enter the channels; yang governs outside while yin governs inside. The Shao Yang's yang, named Zhi Ri, has similar laws above and below, observe its part for any floating or swollen areas, these are all the floating networks of Shao Yang. When there is an abundance of floating networks, they enter the channels. Hence, in the case of the Yang aspect governing inside and the Yin aspect governing outside, it will be absorbed within. The Shao Yin's yin, named Zhi Ren, has similar laws above and below, observe its part for any floating or swollen areas, these are all the floating networks of Shao Yin. When there is an abundance of floating networks, they enter the channels. Their entry into the channels is from the Yang aspect and their exit is from the Yin aspect within the bones. The Heart Governor's yin, named Hui Gua, has similar laws above and below, observe its part for any floating or swollen areas, these are all the floating networks of the Heart Governor. When there is an abundance of floating networks, they enter the channels. The Tai Yin's yin, named Guan Ri, has similar laws above and below, observe its part for any floating or swollen areas, these are all the floating networks of Tai Yin. When there is an abundance of floating networks, they enter the channels. In summary, the twelve channels and network vessels are parts of the skin.</p> <p>2: \u662f\u6545\u767e\u75c5\u4e4b\u59cb\u751f\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u65bc\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u90aa\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5247\u8160\u7406\u958b\uff0c\u958b\u5247\u5165\u5ba2\u65bc\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u7559\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u50b3\u5165\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u7559\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u50b3\u5165\u65bc\u5e9c\uff0c\u5ee9\u65bc\u8178\u80c3\u3002\u90aa\u4e4b\u59cb\u5165\u65bc\u76ae\u4e5f\uff0c\u6cdd\u7136\u8d77\u6beb\u6bdb\uff0c\u958b\u8160\u7406\u3002\u5176\u5165\u65bc\u7d61\u4e5f\uff0c\u5247\u7d61\u8108\u76db\u8272\u8b8a\u3002\u5176\u5165\u5ba2\u65bc\u7d93\u4e5f\uff0c\u5247\u611f\u865b\u4e43\u9677\u4e0b\u3002\u5176\u7559\u65bc\u7b4b\u9aa8\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u5bd2\u591a\u5247\u7b4b\u6523\u9aa8\u75db\uff0c\u71b1\u591a\u5247\u7b4b\u5f1b\u9aa8\u6d88\uff0c\u8089\u720d\u4403\u7834\uff0c\u6bdb\u76f4\u800c\u6557\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u76ae\u4e4b\u5341\u4e8c\u90e8\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u75c5\u7686\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u76ae\u8005\uff0c\u8108\u4e4b\u90e8\u4e5f\u3002\u90aa\u5ba2\u65bc\u76ae\u5247\u8160\u7406\u958b\uff0c\u958b\u5247\u90aa\u5165\u5ba2\u65bc\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u7d61\u8108\u6eff\u5247\u6ce8\u65bc\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u7d93\u8108\u6eff\u5247\u5165\u820d\u65bc\u5e9c\u85cf\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u76ae\u8005\u6709\u5206\u90e8\uff0c\u4e0d\u8207\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u5927\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Therefore, illness begins with one hundred diseases and first manifests in the skin and hair. In the pathological stage, the channels are opened, leading to the penetration of pathogens into the sinew-meridians, where they lodge without leaving, spreading to the organs, lodging without leaving, and spreading to the palace (abdomen). Pathogens enter through the skin and hair, causing small lesions and hair loss. When they invade the meridians, the meridian channels become distended and change color. When pathogens reach the organs, the body's Qi becomes depleted and weakened. The Emperor asked Master Qi: If you can explain how illnesses affecting the skin's twelve divisions arise, what will they be like? The Duke of Shou replied: The skin is a division of the meridians. When pathogens invade the skin, the channels open up, and the pathogens then penetrate the sinew-meridians. When the meridian channels are full, they spread to the organ meridians, which in turn enter and lodge in the palace (abdomen). That is why there are twelve divisions of the skin, and when they are not balanced, illness can develop into a serious condition. The Emperor said: I understand.</p>"},{"location":"57_huangdi-neijing_jing-luo-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u7d93\u7d61\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u7d61\u8108\u4e4b\u898b\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u4e94\u8272\u5404\u7570\uff0c\u9752\u9ec3\u8d64\u767d\u9ed1\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u6709\u5e38\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u7d61\u7121\u5e38\u8b8a\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u4e4b\u5e38\u8272\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5fc3\u8d64\uff0c\u80ba\u767d\uff0c\u809d\u9752\uff0c\u813e\u9ec3\uff0c\u814e\u9ed1\uff0c\u7686\u4ea6\u61c9\u5176\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u8272\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d61\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u4ea6\u61c9\u5176\u7d93\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u7d61\u4e4b\u8272\u61c9\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u967d\u7d61\u4e4b\u8272\u8b8a\u7121\u5e38\uff0c\u96a8\u56db\u6642\u800c\u884c\u4e5f\u3002\u5bd2\u591a\u5247\u51dd\u6ce3\uff0c\u51dd\u6ce3\u5247\u9752\u9ed1\uff0c\u71b1\u591a\u5247\u6dd6\u6fa4\uff0c\u6dd6\u6fa4\u5247\u9ec3\u8d64\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u5e38\u8272\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u7121\u75c5\u3002\u4e94\u8272\u5177\u898b\u8005\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u5bd2\u71b1\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Emperor asked, Regarding the appearance of the pulse, its five colors are different: green, yellow, red, white, and black. What is the reason for this? The Grand Master replied, The Canon has constant colors, but the pulse does not have constancy in its variations. Emperor asked, What are the constant colors of the Canon? The Grand Master said, The heart is red, the lungs are white, the liver is green, the spleen is yellow, and the kidneys are black, all corresponding to the colors of the pulse. Emperor asked, Do the yin and yang of the pulse also correspond to the meridians? The Grand Master said, The color of the yin pulse corresponds to the meridian. The color of the yang pulse varies without constancy, following the four seasons. If there is much cold, it will become congealed and black; if there is much heat, it will become turbid and red. All of these are constant colors, and are said to be without disease. When the five colors are completely manifested, it is called cold and heat.

I am not aware of their locations. I would like to hear about them once again. Tang of Zhou bowed, paid respects and replied, What a difficult question! It is not that the sacred emperor cannot fathom it. So I humbly ask to expound in detail on their locations. The Emperor held out his hand and circumambulated saying, Your opening of my path; I have not seen its location, nor heard of its number, yet through you I am enlightened, and my ears are informed. Tang of Zhou said, This is what is called the easy language of a sage and the ease of controlling a good horse. The Emperor said, My easy language of a sage has not yet opened people's minds. Today, the truth I sought from you, the truth has enlightened me and dispelled my confusion. It is insufficient to discuss it. However, the Emperor requested Tang of Zhou to expound in detail on their locations, letting him understand their meanings, and asked him to conceal it in a golden casket, never to be revealed again. Tang of Zhou bowed and replied, Your subject explains it, my heart is pained and controlled, treating Heaven's lower aperture with Ten Windows and Upper Aperture. The Upper Aperture is the diaphragm, while the Lower Aperture is the Gate of Life. Back-muscle and Yang channels interweave to the left and right. If the disease is at the front, there will be pain in the back; if there is pain in the chest and diaphragm, one cannot breathe or lie down, with shortness of breath and pain on one side, the pulse will be full and slanting out of the gu\u00e0n m\u00e8i. There are 57 water points, and 1 head point for each of the Five Lines. In total, there are 365 acupuncture points.

Excess qi blocks, the pulse is hot, meat fails, and honor guards do not function, and it must become pus inside, break out outside, leaving at the joints, must be ruined.

The source of birth and death lies in them, and they are the abode of gods and spirits. When treating illness, one should seek the root cause. Therefore, accumulate Yang to represent Heaven, and accumulate Yin to represent Earth. When Yin is quiet and Yang is agitated, Yang generates Yin, and Yin nourishes Yang. Yang transforms Qi, and Yin takes form. Hot extremes generate cold, and cold extremes generate heat. Cold Qi generates turbidity, and hot Qi generates clarity.

Flavor nourishes form, form nourishes Qi, Qi nourishes essence, essence transforms into food, and the Qi generates form. When flavor is harmed, Qi is also harmed; when essence is transformed into Qi, Qi will be harmed by flavor. Yin flavor exits through the lower orifice, while Yang Qi exits through the upper orifice. Flavor that is thick pertains to Yin, and what is thin pertains to Yin's Yang. Qi that is thick pertains to Yang, and what is thin pertains to Yang's Yin. Thick flavor leaks, while thin flavor circulates freely. When Qi is thin, it leaks; when it is thick, it generates heat. The robust fire's Qi wanes, while the scant fire's Qi becomes robust. Robust fire consumes Qi, and Qi consumes scant fire. Robust fire disperses Qi, and scant fire generates Qi. Flavor and Qi, bitter and sweet dissipate and scatter as Yang; sour and salty induce excretion as Yin</p> <p>5: \u9670\u52dd\u5247\u967d\u75c5\uff0c\u967d\u52dd\u5247\u9670\u75c5\u3002\u967d\u52dd\u5247\u71b1\uff0c\u9670\u52dd\u5247\u5bd2\u3002\u91cd\u5bd2\u5247\u71b1\uff0c\u91cd\u71b1\u5247\u5bd2\u3002\u5bd2\u50b7\u5f62\uff0c\u71b1\u50b7\u6c23\u3002\u6c23\u50b7\u75db\uff0c\u5f62\u50b7\u816b\u3002\u6545\u5148\u75db\u800c\u5f8c\u816b\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u50b7\u5f62\u4e5f\uff1b\u5148\u816b\u800c\u5f8c\u75db\u8005\uff0c\u5f62\u50b7\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u98a8\u52dd\u5247\u52d5\uff0c\u71b1\u52dd\u5247\u816b\uff0c\u71e5\u52dd\u5247\u4e7e\uff0c\u5bd2\u52dd\u5247\u6d6e\uff0c\u6fd5\u52dd\u5247\u6fe1\u5beb\u3002 When yin prevails, yang becomes sick; when yang prevails, yin becomes sick.

The five organs transform the five types of energy to give rise to feelings of happiness, anger, sadness, and fear. Hence, extreme joy or anger can damage the yin or yang energy, while excessive stimulation of the lungs or liver can disrupt bodily functions. When the vital force ascends too high or when the pulse is disrupted, the body will not be able to heal itself. Therefore, it is essential to maintain balance between yin and yang. In winter, one must protect against cold; in spring, one must prevent heat illnesses; in summer, one must guard against sunstroke; and in autumn, one must avoid dampness to avoid colds and coughs.</p> <p>7: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e0a\u53e4\u8056\u4eba\uff0c\u8ad6\u7406\u4eba\u5f62\uff0c\u5217\u5225\u85cf\u5e9c\uff0c\u7aef\u7d61\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u6703\u901a\u516d\u5408\uff0c\u5404\u5f9e\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u6c23\u7a74\u6240\u767c\u5404\u6709\u8655\u540d\uff0c\u8c3f\u8c37\u5c6c\u9aa8\u7686\u6709\u6240\u8d77\uff0c\u5206\u90e8\u9006\u5f9e\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u689d\u7406\uff0c\u56db\u6642\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u76e1\u6709\u7d93\u7d00\uff0c\u5916\u5167\u4e4b\u61c9\uff0c\u7686\u6709\u8868\u88cf\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u7136\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u6771\u65b9\u751f\u98a8\uff0c\u98a8\u751f\u6728\uff0c\u6728\u751f\u9178\uff0c\u9178\u751f\u809d\uff0c\u809d\u751f\u7b4b\uff0c\u7b4b\u751f\u5fc3\uff0c\u809d\u4e3b\u76ee\u3002\u5176\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u7384\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u70ba\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u5316\u3002\u5316\u751f\u4e94\u5473\uff0c\u9053\u751f\u667a\uff0c\u7384\u751f\u795e\uff0c\u795e\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u98a8\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u6728\uff0c\u5728\u9ad4\u70ba\u7b4b\uff0c\u5728\u85cf\u70ba\u809d\uff0c\u5728\u8272\u70ba\u84bc\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u70ba\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u8072\u70ba\u547c\uff0c\u5728\u8b8a\u52d5\u70ba\u63e1\uff0c\u5728\u7ac5\u70ba\u76ee\uff0c\u5728\u5473\u70ba\u9178\uff0c\u5728\u5fd7\u70ba\u6012\u3002\u6012\u50b7\u809d\uff0c\u60b2\u52dd\u6012\uff1b\u98a8\u50b7\u7b4b\uff0c\u71e5\u52dd\u98a8\uff1b\u9178\u50b7\u7b4b\uff0c\u8f9b\u52dd\u9178\u3002\u5357\u65b9\u751f\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u751f\u706b\uff0c\u706b\u751f\u82e6\uff0c\u82e6\u751f\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u751f\u8840\uff0c\u8840\u751f\u813e\uff0c\u5fc3\u4e3b\u820c\u3002\u5176\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u71b1\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u706b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad4\u70ba\u8108\uff0c\u5728\u85cf\u70ba\u5fc3\uff0c\u5728\u8272\u70ba\u8d64\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u70ba\u5fb5\uff0c\u5728\u8072\u70ba\u7b11\uff0c\u5728\u8b8a\u52d5\u70ba\u6182\uff0c\u5728\u7ac5\u70ba\u820c\uff0c\u5728\u5473\u70ba\u82e6\uff0c\u5728\u5fd7\u70ba\u559c\u3002\u559c\u50b7\u5fc3\uff0c\u6050\u52dd\u559c\uff1b\u71b1\u50b7\u6c23\uff0c\u5bd2\u52dd\u71b1\uff0c\u82e6\u50b7\u6c23\uff0c\u9e79\u52dd\u82e6\u3002\u4e2d\u592e\u751f\u6fd5\uff0c\u6fd5\u751f\u571f\uff0c\u571f\u751f\u7518\uff0c\u7518\u751f\u813e\uff0c\u813e\u751f\u8089\uff0c\u8089\u751f\u80ba\uff0c\u813e\u4e3b\u53e3\u3002\u5176\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u6fd5\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u571f\uff0c\u5728\u9ad4\u70ba\u8089\uff0c\u5728\u85cf\u70ba\u813e\uff0c\u5728\u8272\u70ba\u9ec3\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u70ba\u5bae\uff0c\u5728\u8072\u70ba\u6b4c\uff0c\u5728\u8b8a\u52d5\u70ba\u5666\uff0c\u5728\u7ac5\u70ba\u53e3\uff0c\u5728\u5473\u70ba\u7518\uff0c\u5728\u5fd7\u70ba\u601d\u3002\u601d\u50b7\u813e\uff0c\u6012\u52dd\u601d\uff1b\u6fd5\u50b7\u8089\uff0c\u98a8\u52dd\u6fd5\uff1b\u7518\u50b7\u8089\uff0c\u9178\u52dd\u7518\u3002\u897f\u65b9\u751f\u71e5\uff0c\u71e5\u751f\u91d1\uff0c\u91d1\u751f\u8f9b\uff0c\u8f9b\u751f\u80ba\uff0c\u80ba\u751f\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u76ae\u6bdb\u751f\u814e\uff0c\u80ba\u4e3b\u9f3b\u3002\u5176\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u71e5\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u91d1\uff0c\u5728\u9ad4\u70ba\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u5728\u85cf\u70ba\u80ba\uff0c\u5728\u8272\u70ba\u767d\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u70ba\u5546\uff0c\u5728\u8072\u70ba\u54ed\uff0c\u5728\u8b8a\u52d5\u70ba\u6b2c\uff0c\u5728\u7ac5\u70ba\u9f3b\uff0c\u5728\u5473\u70ba\u8f9b\uff0c\u5728\u5fd7\u70ba\u6182\u3002\u6182\u50b7\u80ba\uff0c\u559c\u52dd\u6182\uff1b\u71b1\u50b7\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u5bd2\u52dd\u71b1\uff1b\u8f9b\u50b7\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u82e6\u52dd\u8f9b\u3002\u5317\u65b9\u751f\u5bd2\uff0c\u5bd2\u751f\u6c34\uff0c\u6c34\u751f\u9e79\uff0c\u9e79\u751f\u814e\uff0c\u814e\u751f\u9aa8\u9ad3\uff0c\u9ad3\u751f\u809d\uff0c\u814e\u4e3b\u8033\u3002\u5176\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u5bd2\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u6c34\uff0c\u5728\u9ad4\u70ba\u9aa8\uff0c\u5728\u85cf\u70ba\u814e\uff0c\u5728\u8272\u70ba\u9ed1\uff0c\u5728\u97f3\u70ba\u7fbd\uff0c\u5728\u8072\u70ba\u547b\uff0c\u5728\u8b8a\u52d5\u70ba\u6144\uff0c\u5728\u7ac5\u70ba\u8033\uff0c\u5728\u5473\u70ba\u9e79\uff0c\u5728\u5fd7\u70ba\u6050\u3002\u6050\u50b7\u814e\uff0c\u601d\u52dd\u6050\uff1b\u5bd2\u50b7\u8840\uff0c\u71e5\u52dd\u5bd2\uff1b\u9e79\u50b7\u8840\uff0c\u7518\u52dd\u9e79\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u8005\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4e4b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e5f\uff1b\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4e4b\u7537\u5973\u4e5f\uff1b\u5de6\u53f3\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u9053\u8def\u4e5f\uff1b\u6c34\u706b\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u5fb5\u5146\u4e5f\uff1b\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4e4b\u80fd\u59cb\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u5728\u5167\uff0c\u967d\u4e4b\u5b88\u4e5f\uff1b\u967d\u5728\u5916\uff1b\u9670\u4e4b\u4f7f\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor asked, I have heard that in ancient times, wise sages discussed the shape of human beings, classified them, listed their different types, and named the places where the Qi channels were located.

Is this true?</p> <p>Duke Ai replied, In the east, there is wind; wind generates wood; wood generates sourness; sourness generates the liver; the liver generates tendons; tendons generate the heart; the liver governs the eyes. The liver's celestial manifestation is the Xuan; its human manifestation is the Dao; its terrestrial manifestation is transformation; its residence is the liver; its color is blue; its sound is a horn; its emotional aspect is anger; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, sorrow surpasses anger.</p> <p>Wind-injured tendons are defeated by dryness; sour-injured tendons are defeated by bitter; bitter-injured hearts are defeated by salty.</p> <p>In the south, there is heat; heat generates fire; fire generates bitterness; bitterness generates the heart; the heart generates blood; blood generates the spleen; the heart governs the tongue. Its celestial manifestation is fire; its terrestrial manifestation is earth; its residence is the vessels; its residence is the spleen; its color is red; its sound is a summons; its emotional aspect is laughter; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, fear surpasses happiness; heat-injured Qi is defeated by cold; bitter-injured Qi is defeated by salty.</p> <p>In the center, there is dampness; dampness generates soil; soil generates sweetness; sweetness generates the spleen; the spleen generates flesh; flesh generates the lungs; the spleen governs the mouth. Its celestial manifestation is dampness; its terrestrial manifestation is earth; its residence is the flesh; its residence is the spleen; its color is yellow; its sound is a palace; its emotional aspect is thought; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, anger surpasses thought; damp-injured flesh is defeated by wind.</p> <p>In the west, there is aridity; aridity generates metal; metal generates pungency; pungency generates the lungs; the lungs generate skin and hair; skin and hair generate the kidneys; the lungs govern the nose. Its celestial manifestation is aridity; its terrestrial manifestation is metal; its residence is the skin and hair; its residence is the kidneys; its color is white; its sound is a market; its emotional aspect is sorrow; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, joy surpasses sorrow; heat-injured skin and hair are defeated by cold; pungency-injured skin and hair are defeated by bitter.</p> <p>In the north, there is cold; cold generates water; water generates salty; salty generates the kidneys; the kidneys generate bone marrow; bone marrow generates the liver; the kidneys govern the ears. Its celestial manifestation is cold; its terrestrial manifestation is water; its residence is the bones; its residence is the kidneys; its color is black; its sound is a cry; its emotional aspect is fear; its organ injured causes pain, and in this case, thought surpasses fear; cold-injured blood is defeated by dryness; salty-injured blood is defeated by sweet.</p> <p>Therefore, it is said that heaven and earth are the foundation of all things; yin and yang are the basis of blood and Qi; left and right are the path of yin and yang; water and fire are the signs of yin and yang; yin and yang are the source of all things. It is said that yin is inside, guarding the Yang; yang is outside, manifesting the function of yin.</p> <p>8: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cd5\u9670\u967d\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u52dd\u5247\u8eab\u71b1\uff0c\u8160\u7406\u9589\uff0c\u5598\u9ea4\u70ba\u4e4b\u4fdb\u4ef0\uff0c\u6c57\u4e0d\u51fa\u800c\u71b1\uff0c\u9f52\u4e7e\u4ee5\u7169\u51a4\u8179\u6eff\uff0c\u6b7b\uff0c\u80fd\u51ac\u4e0d\u80fd\u590f\u3002\u9670\u52dd\u5247\u8eab\u5bd2\u6c57\u51fa\uff0c\u8eab\u5e38\u6e05\uff0c\u6578\u6144\u800c\u5bd2\uff0c\u5bd2\u5247\u53a5\uff0c\u53a5\u5247\u8179\u6eff\uff0c\u6b7b\uff0c\u80fd\u590f\u4e0d\u80fd\u51ac\u3002\u6b64\u9670\u967d\u66f4\u52dd\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u75c5\u4e4b\u5f62\u80fd\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked, What is the difference between Yin and Yang? Duke Zhou replied, If Yang prevails, one will have a fever, the pulse will be tight, there will be shallow breathing and bending over, sweating without perspiration, teeth will be dry causing discomfort in the abdomen, and death. One is unable to withstand cold but can endure heat. If Yin prevails, one will have chills and sweating, the body will always feel cool, there will be frequent urination and feeling cold, leading to danger and fullness in the abdomen, resulting in death. One cannot withstand heat but can endure cold. This is the variation of the supremacy between Yin and Yang, and the form of disease.</p> <p>9: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8abf\u6b64\u4e8c\u8005\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u80fd\u77e5\u4e03\u640d\u516b\u76ca\uff0c\u5247\u4e8c\u8005\u53ef\u8abf\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u7528\u6b64\uff0c\u5247\u65e9\u8870\u4e4b\u7bc0\u4e5f\u3002\u5e74\u56db\u5341\uff0c\u800c\u9670\u6c23\u81ea\u534a\u4e5f\uff0c\u8d77\u5c45\u8870\u77e3\u3002\u5e74\u4e94\u5341\uff0c\u9ad4\u91cd\uff0c\u8033\u76ee\u4e0d\u8070\u660e\u77e3\u3002\u5e74\u516d\u5341\uff0c\u9670\u75ff\uff0c\u6c23\u5927\u8870\uff0c\u4e5d\u7ac5\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u4e0b\u865b\u4e0a\u5be6\uff0c\u6d95\u6ce3\u4ff1\u51fa\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u77e5\u4e4b\u5247\u5f37\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5247\u8001\uff0c\u6545\u540c\u51fa\u800c\u540d\u7570\u8033\u3002\u667a\u8005\u5bdf\u540c\uff0c\u611a\u8005\u5bdf\u7570\uff0c\u611a\u8005\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u667a\u8005\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u6709\u9918\u5247\u8033\u76ee\u8070\u660e\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u8f15\u5f37\uff0c\u8001\u8005\u5fa9\u58ef\uff0c\u58ef\u8005\u76ca\u6cbb\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u8056\u4eba\u70ba\u7121\u70ba\u4e4b\u4e8b\uff0c\u6a02\u606c\u61ba\u4e4b\u80fd\uff0c\u5f9e\u6b32\u5feb\u5fd7\u65bc\u865b\u65e0\u4e4b\u5b88\uff0c\u6545\u58fd\u547d\u65e0\u7aae\uff0c\u8207\u5929\u5730\u7d42\uff0c\u6b64\u8056\u4eba\u4e4b\u6cbb\u8eab\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor asked: What about these two things, how are they? Duke Mu replied: If one can discern the seven gains and eight losses, then these two things can be managed; if one does not know how to use them, then it will be the time of decline. At forty years old, one's vital energy is already half, and one declines in both physical strength and appearance. At fifty years old, one's body becomes heavy, and hearing and sight are no longer clear. At sixty years old, one's genital fluid is exhausted, the lung qi is severely weakened, the nine orifices do not function properly, the lower part is empty while the upper part is full, causing tears to flow. Therefore it is said: knowing this brings strength, not knowing leads to aging. Thus, the wise person perceives the similarity, while the fool perceives the difference. The fool does not suffice, but the wise person has surplus; and with surplus, one's hearing and sight become clear, one's body becomes strong, and the old grow more robust, the robust more treatable. Therefore, a sage deals in what is without action and delights in the ability of tranquility, following desires and hastening to emptiness; thus life is endless, and matches with heaven and earth. This is how a sage treats the body.</p> <p>10: \u5929\u4e0d\u8db3\u897f\u5317\uff0c\u6545\u897f\u5317\u65b9\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u53f3\u8033\u76ee\u4e0d\u5982\u5de6\u660e\u4e5f\u3002\u5730\u4e0d\u6eff\u6771\u5357\uff0c\u6545\u6771\u5357\u65b9\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de6\u624b\u8db3\u4e0d\u5982\u53f3\u5f37\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u7136\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6771\u65b9\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u8005\u5176\u7cbe\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u5247\u4e0a\u660e\u800c\u4e0b\u865b\uff0c\u6545\u4f7f\u8033\u76ee\u8070\u660e\uff0c\u800c\u624b\u8db3\u4e0d\u4fbf\u4e5f\u3002\u897f\u65b9\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u9670\u8005\u5176\u7cbe\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0b\uff0c\u5247\u4e0b\u76db\u800c\u4e0a\u865b\uff0c\u6545\u5176\u8033\u76ee\u4e0d\u8070\u660e\uff0c\u800c\u624b\u8db3\u4fbf\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u4ff1\u611f\u65bc\u90aa\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4e0a\u5247\u53f3\u751a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u5247\u5de6\u751a\uff0c\u6b64\u5929\u5730\u9670\u967d\u6240\u4e0d\u80fd\u5168\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u90aa\u5c45\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u5929\u6709\u7cbe\uff0c\u5730\u6709\u5f62\uff0c\u5929\u6709\u516b\u7d00\uff0c\u5730\u6709\u4e94\u91cc\uff0c\u6545\u80fd\u70ba\u842c\u7269\u4e4b\u7236\u6bcd\u3002\u6e05\u967d\u4e0a\u5929\uff0c\u6fc1\u9670\u6b78\u5730\uff0c\u662f\u6545\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u52d5\u975c\uff0c\u795e\u660e\u70ba\u4e4b\u7db1\u7d00\uff0c\u6545\u80fd\u4ee5\u751f\u9577\u6536\u85cf\uff0c\u7d42\u800c\u5fa9\u59cb\uff0c\u60df\u8ce2\u4eba\u4e0a\u914d\u5929\u4ee5\u990a\u982d\uff0c\u4e0b\u8c61\u5730\u4ee5\u990a\u8db3\uff0c\u4e2d\u508d\u4eba\u4e8b\u4ee5\u990a\u4e94\u85cf\u3002\u5929\u6c23\u901a\u65bc\u80ba\uff0c\u5730\u6c23\u901a\u65bc\u55cc\uff0c\u98a8\u6c23\u901a\u65bc\u809d\uff0c\u96f7\u6c23\u901a\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u8c37\u6c23\u901a\u65bc\u813e\uff0c\u96e8\u6c23\u901a\u65bc\u814e\u3002\u516d\u7d93\u70ba\u5ddd\uff0c\u8178\u80c3\u70ba\u6d77\uff0c\u4e5d\u7ac5\u70ba\u6c34\u6ce8\u4e4b\u6c23\u3002\u4ee5\u5929\u5730\u70ba\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u4e4b\u6c57\uff0c\u4ee5\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u96e8\u540d\u4e4b\uff1b\u967d\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee5\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u75be\u98a8\u540d\u4e4b\u3002\u66b4\u6c23\u8c61\u96f7\uff0c\u9006\u6c23\u8c61\u967d\u3002\u6545\u6cbb\u4e0d\u6cd5\u5929\u4e4b\u7d00\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u5730\u4e4b\u7406\uff0c\u5247\u707d\u5bb3\u81f3\u77e3\u3002 The Heaven above is not fully to the West, hence the West region is shadowy. The Earth below is not fully to the South-East, hence the South-East region is bright. The Emperor asked, Why is this so? The Duke of Chou replied, The East is bright, and brightness concentrates on top; when brightness is above, it is clear while it is empty below, causing the eyes and ears to be keen and sharp but making hands and feet weak. The West is shadowy, and shadows concentrate at the bottom; when shadows are at the bottom, there is abundance downwards and emptiness upwards, causing the eyes and ears not to be keen and sharp but making hands and feet agile. Both of these cause confusion, with confusion residing above making the right pronounced and below making the left pronounced, manifesting the inability of Heaven and Earth. Hence, Heaven has essence and Earth has form, Heaven has eight seasons and Earth has five li, allowing them to be parents for all things. The clear Yang ascends to Heaven; the turbid Yin returns to Earth. Therefore, the movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth have the spirits and light as their standards, enabling generation, growth, storage, and renewal. Only sages regulate Heaven above to nourish their heads, control Earth below to nourish their feet, and manage people's affairs to nourish their five viscera. The lung meridian receives the Qi of Heaven and Earth; the mouth meridian receives the Qi of Heaven and Earth; the liver meridian receives the wind Qi; the heart meridian receives the thunder Qi; the spleen meridian receives the grain Qi; the kidney meridian receives the water Qi. The six channels are like rivers, the stomach and intestines are like seas, and the nine orifices are the points of registration for the Qi of water. By using Heaven and Earth as the basis of Yin and Yang, the Yang sweat is named by Heaven and Earth's rain; the Yang Qi is named by Heaven and Earth's brisk wind. The thunder manifests as Yang energy; the lightning manifests as Yin energy. Therefore, treating unlawfulness in Heaven's records will bring disasters upon us</p> <p>11: \u6545\u90aa\u98a8\u4e4b\u81f3\uff0c\u75be\u5982\u98a8\u96e8\uff0c\u6545\u5584\u6cbb\u8005\u6cbb\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u6cbb\u808c\u819a\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u6cbb\u7b4b\u8108\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u6cbb\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u6cbb\u4e94\u85cf\u3002\u6cbb\u4e94\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u534a\u6b7b\u534a\u751f\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u5929\u4e4b\u90aa\u6c23\uff0c\u611f\u5247\u5bb3\u4eba\u4e94\u85cf\uff1b\u6c34\u7a40\u4e4b\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u611f\u5247\u5bb3\u65bc\u516d\u5e9c\uff1b\u5730\u4e4b\u6fd5\u6c23\uff0c\u611f\u5247\u5bb3\u76ae\u8089\u7b4b\u8108\u3002\u6545\u5584\u7528\u937c\u8005\uff0c\u5f9e\u9670\u5f15\u967d\uff0c\u5f9e\u967d\u5f15\u9670\uff0c\u4ee5\u53f3\u6cbb\u5de6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5de6\u6cbb\u53f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u6211\u77e5\u5f7c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8868\u77e5\u88cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u89c0\u904e\u8207\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e4b\u7406\uff0c\u898b\u5fae\u5f97\u904e\uff0c\u7528\u4e4b\u4e0d\u6b86\u3002\u5584\u8a3a\u8005\uff0c\u5bdf\u8272\u6309\u8108\uff0c\u5148\u5225\u9670\u967d\uff1b\u5be9\u6e05\u6fc1\uff0c\u800c\u77e5\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u8996\u5598\u606f\uff0c\u807d\u97f3\u8072\uff0c\u800c\u77e5\u6240\u82e6\uff1b\u89c0\u6b0a\u8861\u898f\u77e9\uff0c\u800c\u77e5\u75c5\u6240\u4e3b\u3002\u6309\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u89c0\u6d6e\u6c88\u6ed1\u6fc7\uff0c\u800c\u77e5\u75c5\u6240\u751f\uff1b\u4ee5\u6cbb\u7121\u904e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8a3a\u5247\u4e0d\u5931\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u4e4b\u59cb\u8d77\u4e5f\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u800c\u5df2\uff1b\u5176\u76db\uff0c\u53ef\u5f85\u8870\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u6545\u56e0\u5176\u8f15\u800c\u63da\u4e4b\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u91cd\u800c\u6e1b\u4e4b\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8870\u800c\u5f70\u4e4b\u3002\u5f62\u4e0d\u8db3\u8005\uff0c\u6eab\u4e4b\u4ee5\u6c23\uff0c\u7cbe\u4e0d\u8db3\u8005\uff0c\u88dc\u4e4b\u4ee5\u5473\u3002\u5176\u9ad8\u8005\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u8d8a\u4e4b\uff1b\u5176\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u5f15\u800c\u7aed\u4e4b\uff1b\u4e2d\u6eff\u8005\uff0c\u5beb\u4e4b\u65bc\u5167\uff1b\u5176\u6709\u90aa\u8005\uff0c\u6f2c\u5f62\u4ee5\u70ba\u6c57\uff1b\u5176\u5728\u76ae\u8005\uff0c\u6c57\u800c\u767c\u4e4b\uff1b\u5176\u6153\u608d\u8005\uff0c\u6309\u800c\u6536\u4e4b\uff1b\u5176\u5be6\u8005\uff0c\u6563\u800c\u5beb\u4e4b\u3002\u5be9\u5176\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5225\u67d4\u525b\uff0c\u967d\u75c5\u6cbb\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u75c5\u6cbb\u967d\uff0c\u5b9a\u5176\u8840\u6c23\uff0c\u5404\u5b88\u5176\u9109\uff0c\u8840\u5be6\u5b9c\u6c7a\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c23\u865b\u5b9c\ud851\ude72\u5f15\u4e4b\u3002 When evil winds reach their peak, they move swiftly like wind and rain. Therefore, a good doctor treats the skin, then treats the muscles, then treats the channels, then treats the six palaces, then treats the five organs. Treating the five organs is as if one were halfway dead and halfway alive. Thus, heaven's evil qi affects people's five organs; earth's damp qi harms skin, flesh, tendons, and channels; cold and heat from grains affect six palaces. Therefore, skilled acupuncturists guide yin to treat yang and guide yang to treat yin, treating right with left and left with right, knowing the other through knowing oneself, understanding what is hidden by looking at what is apparent, and using what is slight without exhausting it. Skilled diagnosticians examine color and pulse, differentiate yin and yang first; discern clear and turbid, knowing the areas affected; observe wheezing and breathing, listen to sounds, knowing where the ailment lies. They note the balance of heaviness and lightness, know where the illness originates; they warm with qi when there is not enough form, supplement with flavor when there is not enough essence. For high ones, they guide upward; for low ones, they draw out; for those who are full, they disperse within; for those with evil, they sweat to release; for those in the skin, they sweat and expel; for those who are stubborn, they press and absorb; for those who have solidified, they scatter and disperse. Discern their yin and yang, differentiating softness and hardness; treat yang diseases with yin and treat yin diseases with yang, stabilize their blood and qi, each guarding its territory.

Huang Di answered: The kidney is the root of the Yin, and the Yin is responsible for storing water. The lung is the Ta Yin, Shao Yin is the small intestine channel, so its source is in the kidney and its end is in the lung, all of which are involved in storing water. Emperor asked: How can the kidney be able to gather water and cause disease? Huang Di answered: The kidney is the gateway of the stomach, and if the gateway is not functioning properly, it will gather water according to its kind, and the accumulation will overflow upwards and downwards, causing the skin to swell, and swelling is a disease caused by gathering water.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8af8\u6c34\u7686\u751f\u65bc\u814e\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u814e\u8005\uff0c\u725d\u85cf\u4e5f\uff0c\u5730\u6c23\u4e0a\u8005\u5c6c\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6c34\u6db2\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u81f3\u9670\u3002\u52c7\u800c\u52de\u751a\u5247\u814e\u6c57\u51fa\uff0c\u814e\u6c57\u51fa\u9022\u65bc\u98a8\uff0c\u5167\u4e0d\u5f97\u5165\u65bc\u85cf\u5e9c\uff0c\u5916\u4e0d\u5f97\u8d8a\u65bc\u76ae\u819a\uff0c\u5ba2\u65bc\u7384\u5e9c\uff0c\u884c\u65bc\u76ae\u88cf\uff0c\u50b3\u70ba\u80d5\u816b\uff0c\u672c\u4e4b\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u98a8\u6c34\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u7384\u5e9c\u8005\uff0c\u6c57\u7a7a\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor said: All waters are born from the kidneys.

Master J\u012b said: The renal points number fifty-seven orifices, where energy is stored and from which water enters and exits. When the water channel is diseased, below it there is distention and fullness in the abdomen, above it there is wheezing and panting, and one cannot lie down; this is a classic case of the renal points. Consequently, water pathology results in the lungs causing wheezing and panting, and the kidneys causing water retention. The lungs are unable to rest, with symptoms spreading to other channels as well. This is where water energy gathers. Six meridian points lie above the lower abdomen, which are the renal channel street. The three Yin intersect at the feet. At the ankle, there is one meridian point with six lines, which is the lower pathway of the kidney's meridian, known as Taiyi. All fifty-seven points are associated with hidden yin channels and serve as storage for water energy.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u53d6\u7d61\u8108\u5206\u8089\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u8005\uff0c\u6728\u59cb\u6cbb\uff0c\u809d\u6c23\u59cb\u751f\uff0c\u809d\u6c23\u6025\uff0c\u5176\u98a8\u75be\uff0c\u7d93\u8108\u5e38\u6df1\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u5c11\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u6545\u53d6\u7d61\u8108\u5206\u8089\u9593\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u590f\u53d6\u76db\u7d93\u5206\u8160\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u590f\u8005\uff0c\u706b\u59cb\u6cbb\uff0c\u5fc3\u6c23\u59cb\u9577\uff0c\u8108\u7626\u6c23\u5f31\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u7559\u6ea2\uff0c\u71b1\u718f\u5206\u8160\uff0c\u5167\u81f3\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u6545\u53d6\u76db\u7d93\u5206\u8160\u7d55\u819a\u800c\u75c5\u53bb\u8005\uff0c\u90aa\u5c45\u6dfa\u4e5f\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u76db\u7d93\u8005\uff0c\u967d\u8108\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u79cb\u53d6\u7d93\u4fde\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u79cb\u8005\uff0c\u91d1\u59cb\u6cbb\uff0c\u80ba\u5c07\u6536\u6bba\uff0c\u91d1\u5c07\u52dd\u706b\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u5728\u5408\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u521d\u52dd\uff0c\u6fd5\u6c23\u53ca\u9ad4\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u672a\u76db\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u6545\u53d6\u4fde\u4ee5\u5beb\u9670\u90aa\uff0c\u53d6\u5408\u4ee5\u865b\u967d\u90aa\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u59cb\u8870\uff0c\u6545\u53d6\u65bc\u5408\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u51ac\u53d6\u4e95\u69ae\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u51ac\u8005\uff0c\u6c34\u59cb\u6cbb\uff0c\u814e\u65b9\u9589\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u8870\u5c11\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u5805\u76db\uff0c\u5de8\u967d\u4f0f\u6c88\uff0c\u967d\u8108\u4e43\u53bb\uff0c\u6545\u53d6\u4e95\u4ee5\u4e0b\u9670\u9006\uff0c\u53d6\u69ae\u4ee5\u5be6\u967d\u6c23\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u51ac\u53d6\u4e95\u69ae\uff0c\u6625\u4e0d\u9f3d\u8844\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked: Why do you take the Chong channel in spring? [Response] The Duke said: In spring, wood is beginning to be treated, the liver's Qi is starting to emerge, the liver's Qi is urgent, its wind and rapidity, the channels are always deep, its Qi is insufficient, it cannot penetrate deeply, so you take the Chong channel and divide the flesh. The Emperor asked: Why do you take the abundant channel in summer? [Response] The Duke said: In summer, fire is beginning to be treated, the heart's Qi is starting to grow larger, the pulse becomes thin and the Qi is weak, the Yang Qi accumulates and overflows, the heat scatters in the channels, it is located within the meridians, so you take the abundant channel and divide the tendons while the disease disappears, this evil resides shallowly, what is called an abundant channel is the Yang meridian. The Emperor asked: Why do you take the lung channel in autumn? [Response] The Duke said: In autumn, metal is beginning to be treated, the lungs are about to withdraw and suppress, gold is about to prevail over fire, Yang Qi is present, Yin Qi is starting to win, dampness Qi also enters the body, Yin Qi is not yet full, it cannot penetrate deeply, so you take the Gu for expelling Yin evil, and take the merger for emptying Yang evil, as Yang Qi begins to decline. The Emperor asked: Why do you take the well and brilliance in winter? [Response] The Duke said: In winter, water is beginning to be treated, the kidneys are about to close, Yang Qi declines and is insufficient, Yin Qi is firm and full, grand Yang conceals itself, the Yang meridian has gone, so you take the well for expelling lower Yin reversal, and take brilliance for nourishing Yang Qi. Therefore, it is said: In winter, take the well and brilliance; in spring, there is no harm, this is what is meant.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u6cbb\u71b1\u75c5\u4e94\u5341\u4e5d\u4fde\uff0c\u4f59\u8ad6\u5176\u610f\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u9818\u5225\u5176\u8655\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u8655\uff0c\u56e0\u805e\u5176\u610f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u982d\u4e0a\u4e94\u884c\u884c\u4e94\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u8d8a\u8af8\u967d\u4e4b\u71b1\u9006\u4e5f\u3002\u5927\u677c\u81ba\u4fde\u7f3a\u76c6\u80cc\u4fde\u6b64\u516b\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5beb\u80f8\u4e2d\u4e4b\u71b1\u4e5f\u3002\u6c23\u8857\u4e09\u91cc\u5de8\u865b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5ec9\u6b64\u516b\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5beb\u80c3\u4e2d\u4e4b\u71b1\u4e5f\u3002\u96f2\u9580\u9ac3\u9aa8\u59d4\u4e2d\u9ad3\u7a7a\u6b64\u516b\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5beb\u56db\u652f\u4e4b\u71b1\u4e5f\u3002\u4e94\u85cf\u4fde\u508d\u4e94\u6b64\u5341\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5beb\u4e94\u85cf\u4e4b\u71b1\u4e5f\u3002\u51e1\u6b64\u4e94\u5341\u4e5d\u7a74\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u71b1\u4e4b\u5de6\u53f3\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u50b7\u65bc\u5bd2\u800c\u50b3\u70ba\u71b1\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5bd2\u76db\uff0c\u5247\u751f\u71b1\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said: Master Zhang asks about the treatment of fever, and I have discussed the meaning of his words, but I am unable to distinguish their significance. I would like to hear more so that I can understand their meaning. Qi Bo replied: There are five lines on the head, representing the reversal of Yang's heat. Eight points involving the chest, shoulder, and back correspond to heat in the chest. Three lines at Gas Street, on a giant vacuity, correspond to heat in the stomach. The eight points at Yunmen's hair, bones, marrow, and hollow represent heat in the arms. Ten points around the five viscera correspond to heat within the viscera. In total, there are fifty-nine points. All of these points are associated with left and right heat. The Emperor asked: If a person is injured by cold, how can it lead to fever? Qi Bo replied: When cold is excessive, it generates heat.</p>"},{"location":"62_huangdi-neijing_diao-jing-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u8abf\u7d93\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u523a\u6cd5\u8a00\uff0c\u6709\u9918\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u9918\u6709\u4e94\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ea6\u6709\u4e94\uff0c\u5e1d\u6b32\u4f55\u554f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1b\u9858\u76e1\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u795e\u6709\u9918\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8840\u6709\u9918\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f62\u6709\u9918\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5fd7\u6709\u9918\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u51e1\u6b64\u5341\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u6709\u7cbe\u6c23\u6d25\u6db2\uff0c\u56db\u652f\u4e5d\u7ac5\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u5341\u516d\u90e8\uff0c\u4e09\u767e\u516d\u5341\u4e94\u7bc0\uff0c\u4e43\u751f\u767e\u75c5\uff0c\u767e\u75c5\u4e4b\u751f\uff0c\u7686\u6709\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u4eca\u592b\u5b50\u4e43\u8a00\u6709\u9918\u6709\u4e94\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ea6\u6709\u4e94\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u751f\u4e4b\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7686\u751f\u65bc\u4e94\u85cf\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u5fc3\u85cf\u795e\uff0c\u80ba\u85cf\u6c23\uff0c\u809d\u85cf\u8840\uff0c\u813e\u85cf\u8089\uff0c\u814e\u85cf\u5fd7\uff0c\u800c\u6b64\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u5fd7\u610f\u901a\u5167\u9023\u9aa8\u9ad3\uff0c\u800c\u6210\u8eab\u5f62\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u7686\u51fa\u65bc\u7d93\u96a7\u4ee5\u884c\u8840\u6c23\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4e0d\u548c\uff0c\u767e\u75c5\u4e43\u8b8a\u5316\u800c\u751f\uff0c\u662f\u6545\u5b88\u7d93\u96a7\u7109\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked, saying: I have heard that acupuncture discusses more than enough and insufficient, but there are no specific descriptions of either. What does more than enough mean, and what does insufficient mean? Huan Di replied: More than enough has five aspects, and insufficient also has five aspects; what do you want to ask, Emperor? The Emperor said: I wish to hear fully about them. Huan Di said: There is more than enough and insufficient in spirit, qi, blood, form, and willpower. In total, these ten aspects have unbalanced qi. People have vital energy and body fluids, four limbs and nine orifices, five organs and sixteen departments, three hundred sixty-five joints, which give rise to one hundred diseases, and the generation of these hundred diseases is a mixture of reality and emptiness. Now, Master, you say there are more than enough and insufficient aspects; how do they generate them? Huan Di replied: They all arise from the five organs. The heart houses spirit, the lungs house qi, the liver houses blood, the spleen houses flesh, the kidneys house willpower, and this forms the body. Will and intention connect to the bone marrow within, forming the body's shape through the five organs. The way of the five organs is all derived from the meridians and vessels, and regulating blood and qi leads to the transformation and generation of one hundred diseases; therefore, protect the meridians and vessels.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u795e\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u795e\u6709\u9918\u5247\u7b11\u4e0d\u4f11\uff0c\u795e\u4e0d\u8db3\u5247\u60b2\u3002\u8840\u6c23\u672a\u5e76\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u5b89\u5b9a\uff0c\u90aa\u5ba2\u65bc\u5f62\uff0c\u6d12\u6dc5\u8d77\u65bc\u6beb\u6bdb\uff0c\u672a\u5165\u65bc\u7d93\u7d61\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u547d\u66f0\u795e\u4e4b\u5fae\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u5beb\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u795e\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u5247\u5beb\u5176\u5c0f\u7d61\u4e4b\u8840\uff0c\u51fa\u8840\u52ff\u4e4b\u6df1\u65a5\uff0c\u7121\u4e2d\u5176\u5927\u7d93\uff0c\u795e\u6c23\u4e43\u5e73\u3002\u795e\u4e0d\u8db3\u8005\uff0c\u8996\u5176\u865b\u7d61\uff0c\u6309\u800c\u81f4\u4e4b\uff0c\u523a\u800c\u5229\u4e4b\uff0c\u7121\u51fa\u5176\u8840\uff0c\u7121\u6cc4\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee5\u901a\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u795e\u6c23\u4e43\u5e73\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u5fae\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6309\u6469\u52ff\u91cb\uff0c\u8457\u937c\u52ff\u65a5\uff0c\u79fb\u6c23\u65bc\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u795e\u6c23\u4e43\u5f97\u5fa9\u3002 The Emperor asked: What is it like when there is an excess or deficiency of the spirit?  Huzi replied: When there is an excess of the spirit, one cannot stop laughing; when there is a deficiency of the spirit, one cannot stop weeping. Before the blood and qi have been combined, and the five organs have become stable, evil spirits attack the surface of the body and emerge from the hair follicles without entering the channels, hence it is called the subtle manifestation of the spirit. The Emperor asked: What are the prescriptions for supplementation? Huzi replied: If there is an excess of the spirit, write down the points of small vessels to bleed, but do not let the bleeding be too deep; without focusing on the major channels, the spirit's qi will become balanced. For one with a deficiency of the spirit, observe the empty vessels, press and bring them to life, pierce and make them sharp, but do not let any blood come out nor any qi leak, to open up the channels, and the spirit's qi will become balanced. The Emperor asked: What is needle-poking in small amounts? Huzi replied: Do not massage too much, refrain from using needles too often, guide the qi towards where there is a deficiency, and the spirit's qi will recover</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u5247\u5598\u6b2c\uff0c\u4e0a\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5247\u606f\u5229\u5c11\u6c23\u3002\u8840\u6c23\u672a\u5e76\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u5b89\u5b9a\uff0c\u76ae\u819a\u5fae\u75c5\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u767d\u6c23\u5fae\u6cc4\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u5beb\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u5247\u5beb\u5176\u7d93\u96a7\uff0c\u7121\u50b7\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u7121\u51fa\u5176\u8840\uff0c\u7121\u6cc4\u5176\u6c23\u3002\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5247\u88dc\u5176\u7d93\u96a7\uff0c\u7121\u51fa\u5176\u6c23\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u5fae\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6309\u6469\u52ff\u91cb\uff0c\u51fa\u937c\u8996\u4e4b\uff0c\u66f0\u6211\u5c07\u6df1\u4e4b\uff0c\u9069\u4eba\u5fc5\u9769\uff0c\u7cbe\u6c23\u81ea\u4f0f\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u6563\u4e82\uff0c\u7121\u6240\u4f11\u606f\uff0c\u6c23\u6cc4\u8160\u7406\uff0c\u771f\u6c23\u4e43\u76f8\u5f97\u3002 Emperor: Good. What if there is still not enough? Master Qi Bo said: If there is excessive qi, it will cause panting and shortness of breath; if there is not enough qi, the breathing will be shallow. The blood and qi are not yet united, the five organs are stable, the skin has a slight illness, and it is called white qi leaking. Emperor: What should be supplemented? Master Qi Bo said: If there is excessive qi, write its meridians, without damaging its meridians, without bleeding it, or leaking its qi. If it is not sufficient, supplement the meridians without leaking its qi. Emperor: How shall I acupuncture it? Master Qi Bo said: Gently massage without releasing, observe the needle and say, I will go deep, appropriate people must be cured, essential qi will retreat, evil qi will scatter and be disordered, with no place to rest, leaking qi damages the channels, and true qi comes together.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u8840\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8840\u6709\u9918\u5247\u6012\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u5247\u6050\u3002\u8840\u6c23\u672a\u5e76\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u5b89\u5b9a\uff0c\u5b6b\u7d61\u6c34\u6ea2\uff0c\u5247\u7d93\u6709\u7559\u8840\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u5beb\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8840\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u5247\u5beb\u5176\u76db\u7d93\u51fa\u5176\u8840\u3002\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5247\u8996\u5176\u865b\u7d93\u5167\u937c\u5176\u8108\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e45\u7559\u800c\u8996\uff0c\u8108\u5927\uff0c\u75be\u51fa\u5176\u937c\uff0c\u7121\u4ee4\u8840\u6cc4\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u7559\u8840\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8996\u5176\u8840\u7d61\uff0c\u523a\u51fa\u5176\u8840\uff0c\u7121\u4ee4\u60e1\u8840\u5f97\u5165\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u4ee5\u6210\u5176\u75be\u3002 The Emperor said: Good. Is there not enough blood or is it excessive? Qi Bo said: If there is an excess of blood, one will be angry; if there is insufficient blood, one will be afraid. If the vital energy has not been harmonized and the five organs are in equilibrium, the channels may overflow with fluid, leading to retained blood in the meridians. The Emperor said: How should it be treated? Qi Bo said: If there is an excess of blood, record the amount of bleeding and let the blood. If there is insufficient blood, observe the empty channels and insert needles into the meridians to facilitate healing over time. When the pulse becomes strong and the bleeding speeds up, withdraw the needle without causing any leakage of blood. The Emperor said: How should the retained blood be drained? Qi Bo said: Observe the flow of blood and drain it from the channels, ensuring that no negative blood enters the meridians, thereby completing the process swiftly.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5f62\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5f62\u6709\u9918\u5247\u8179\u8139\u6d87\u6eb2\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u5247\u56db\u652f\u4e0d\u7528\u3002\u8840\u6c23\u672a\u5e76\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u5b89\u5b9a\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u8815\u52d5\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u5fae\u98a8\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u5beb\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5f62\u6709\u9918\u5247\u5beb\u5176\u967d\u7d93\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u5247\u88dc\u5176\u967d\u7d61\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u5fae\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53d6\u5206\u8089\u9593\uff0c\u7121\u4e2d\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u7121\u50b7\u5176\u7d61\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u5f97\u5fa9\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u4e43\u7d22\u3002 Emperor said: Good.

The Duke of Shou replied: Just take it, find the meridian in the middle, and that is where disease can establish a foundation.</p> <p>7: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u4f59\u5df2\u805e\u865b\u5be6\u4e4b\u5f62\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u4f55\u4ee5\u751f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u8840\u4ee5\u5e76\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u50be\uff0c\u6c23\u4e82\u65bc\u885b\uff0c\u8840\u9006\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u96e2\u5c45\uff0c\u4e00\u5be6\u4e00\u865b\u3002\u8840\u5e76\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u967d\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u9a5a\u72c2\u3002\u8840\u5e76\u65bc\u967d\uff0c\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u4e43\u70ba\u7085\u4e2d\u3002\u8840\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0b\uff0c\u5fc3\u7169\u60cb\u5584\u6012\u3002\u8840\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0b\uff0c\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e82\u800c\u559c\u5fd8\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8840\u5e76\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u967d\uff0c\u5982\u662f\u8840\u6c23\u96e2\u5c45\uff0c\u4f55\u8005\u70ba\u5be6\uff0c\u4f55\u8005\u70ba\u865b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8840\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u559c\u6eab\u800c\u60e1\u5bd2\uff0c\u5bd2\u5247\u6ce3\u4e0d\u80fd\u6d41\uff0c\u6eab\u5247\u6d88\u800c\u53bb\u4e4b\u3002\u662f\u6545\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u5e76\u70ba\u8840\u865b\uff0c\u8840\u4e4b\u6240\u5e76\u70ba\u6c23\u865b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u4e4b\u6240\u6709\u8005\uff0c\u8840\u8207\u6c23\u8033\u3002\u4eca\u592b\u5b50\u4e43\u8a00\u8840\u5e76\u70ba\u865b\uff0c\u6c23\u5e76\u70ba\u865b\uff0c\u662f\u7121\u5be6\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u8005\u70ba\u5be6\uff0c\u7121\u8005\u70ba\u865b\uff0c\u6545\u6c23\u5e76\u5247\u7121\u8840\uff0c\u8840\u5e76\u5247\u7121\u6c23\uff0c\u4eca\u8840\u8207\u6c23\u76f8\u5931\uff0c\u6545\u70ba\u865b\u7109\u3002\u7d61\u4e4b\u8207\u5b6b\u8108\u4ff1\u8f38\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u8840\u8207\u6c23\u5e76\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u5be6\u7109\u3002\u8840\u4e4b\u8207\u6c23\u5e76\u8d70\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u5927\u53a5\uff0c\u53a5\u5247\u66b4\u6b7b\uff0c\u6c23\u5fa9\u53cd\u5247\u751f\uff0c\u4e0d\u53cd\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5be6\u8005\u4f55\u9053\u5f9e\u4f86\uff0c\u865b\u8005\u4f55\u9053\u5f9e\u53bb\uff0c\u865b\u5be6\u4e4b\u8981\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6545\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u9670\u8207\u967d\uff0c\u7686\u6709\u4fde\u6703\uff0c\u967d\u6ce8\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u6eff\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u52fb\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5176\u5f62\uff0c\u4e5d\u5019\u82e5\u4e00\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u5e73\u4eba\u3002 Emperor: Good. I have already heard about the forms of truth and falsehood, but I do not know how they come into being. Duke of Shou said: Qi and blood intermingle, yin and yang are tilted, qi is chaotic in the Wei, blood rebels in the meridians, qi and blood are separated, one is true and one is false. Blood gathers in the yin, qi gathers in the yang, hence it becomes mania. Blood gathers in the yang, qi gathers in the yin, which leads to coma. Emperor: If blood gathers in the yin and qi gathers in the yang, and this is a case of qi and blood being separated, what is true and what is false? Duke of Shou said: Qi and blood, which like warmth and dislike cold, cry without being able to flow when it's cold, and dissipate when it's warm. Therefore, where qi gathers, blood is false, and where blood gathers, qi is false. Emperor: People have both qi and blood. Now Master Zhou says that blood gathering is false and qi gathering is false, does this mean there is no truth? Duke of Shou said: What exists is true, what doesn't exist is false. Since there is a lack of qi and blood in balance, it becomes false. When the qi and blood are connected with the channels, it becomes true. Blood and qi rise to the upper part, which leads to grand mal seizure. Grand mal seizure causes violent death, and if qi reverses it can lead to recovery, but without reversal it results in death. Emperor: What is the truth of yin and yang? What is the path of falsehood? I wish to hear about the essence of falsehood and truth. Duke of Shou said: Yin and yang have their own balance. Yang nourishes yin, and yin fulfills the outer space of yang. When yin and yang are leveled, they fill each other and maintain their forms, just like the nine phases being one. It is called the even person.</p> <p>8: \u592b\u90aa\u4e4b\u751f\u4e5f\uff0c\u6216\u751f\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u6216\u751f\u65bc\u967d\u3002\u5176\u751f\u65bc\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u98a8\u96e8\u5bd2\u6691\u3002\u5176\u751f\u65bc\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u5f97\u4e4b\u98f2\u98df\u5c45\u8655\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u559c\u6012\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u98a8\u96e8\u4e4b\u50b7\u4eba\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u98a8\u96e8\u4e4b\u50b7\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5148\u5ba2\u65bc\u76ae\u819a\uff0c\u50b3\u5165\u65bc\u5b6b\u8108\uff0c\u5b6b\u8108\u6eff\u5247\u50b3\u5165\u65bc\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u7d61\u8108\u6eff\u5247\u8f38\u65bc\u5927\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u8207\u90aa\u5e76\u5ba2\u65bc\u5206\u8160\u4e4b\u9592\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u5805\u5927\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5be6\u3002\u5be6\u8005\u5916\u5805\u5145\u6eff\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6309\u4e4b\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u5247\u75db\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5bd2\u6fd5\u4e4b\u50b7\u4eba\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5bd2\u6fd5\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u76ae\u819a\u4e0d\u6536\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u5805\u7dca\uff0c\u69ae\u8840\u6ce3\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u53bb\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u865b\u3002\u865b\u8005\u8076\u8f9f\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u5247\u6c23\u8db3\u4ee5\u6eab\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u5feb\u7136\u800c\u4e0d\u75db\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u9670\u4e4b\u751f\u5be6\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u559c\u6012\u4e0d\u7bc0\uff0c\u5247\u9670\u6c23\u4e0a\u9006\uff0c\u4e0a\u9006\u5247\u4e0b\u865b\uff0c\u4e0b\u865b\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u8d70\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u5be6\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u4e4b\u751f\u865b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u559c\u5247\u6c23\u4e0b\uff0c\u60b2\u5247\u6c23\u6d88\uff0c\u6d88\u5247\u8108\u865b\u7a7a\uff0c\u56e0\u5bd2\u98f2\u98df\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c23\u718f\u6eff\uff0c\u5247\u8840\u6ce3\u6c23\u53bb\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u865b\u77e3\u3002 The Emperor asked: How is evil born? It can be born from Yin or Yang. The one born from Yang receives the harm of wind and rain. The one born from Yin receives harm from drink, food, dwelling place, and emotional disturbance. Emperor asked: How does wind and rain injure a person?</p> <p>Guan Pu answered: Wind and rain injure a person by first attacking the skin. They penetrate into the muscle vessels, then into the tendons vessels, and finally into the great vessel. The blood and qi, along with evil, lodge in the dividing space of the brain, causing a hard and swollen pulse, hence it is called Real.</p> <p>Real refers to a hard, full feeling that cannot be pushed, but if pushed it will hurt. Emperor asked: How does cold and damp injury a person?</p> <p>Guan Pu answered: Cold and damp injure the middle-energy of a person by not allowing the skin to contract and tightening the muscles. The defense qi leaves, hence it is called Empty.</p> <p>Empty refers to being deafened in the energy and not feeling warm, but when pressed it feels warm, hence it resolves quickly without pain. Emperor asked: Good.</p> <p>The Emperor asked: How does Yang generate Real?</p> <p>Guan Pu answered: Lack of self-control in joy and anger generates Yin energy. When Yin energy ascends, it causes the lower energy to be empty. An empty lower energy allows Yang energy to move freely, hence it is called Real.</p> <p>The Emperor asked: How does Yin generate Empty?</p> <p>Guan Pu answered: Delight causes the energy to descend and grief causes the energy to dissipate. The pulse becomes empty and weak, leading to cold, drink, and food. Cold qi fills the body, hence blood and qi leave, causing it to be called Empty.</p> <p>9: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u8a00\u967d\u865b\u5247\u5916\u5bd2\uff0c\u9670\u865b\u5247\u5167\u71b1\uff0c\u967d\u76db\u5247\u5916\u71b1\uff0c\u9670\u76db\u5247\u5167\u5bd2\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u805e\u4e4b\u77e3\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u6240\u7531\u7136\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u53d7\u6c23\u65bc\u4e0a\u7126\uff0c\u4ee5\u6eab\u76ae\u819a\u5206\u8089\u4e4b\u9592\u3002\u4ee4\u5bd2\u6c23\u5728\u5916\uff0c\u5247\u4e0a\u7126\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u4e0a\u7126\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5247\u5bd2\u6c23\u7368\u7559\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u6545\u5bd2\u6144\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u865b\u751f\u5167\u71b1\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u6240\u52de\u5026\uff0c\u5f62\u6c23\u8870\u5c11\uff0c\u7a40\u6c23\u4e0d\u76db\uff0c\u4e0a\u7126\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u4e0b\u8118\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u80c3\u6c23\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u6c23\u718f\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u6545\u5167\u71b1\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u76db\u751f\u5916\u71b1\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u7126\u4e0d\u901a\u5229\uff0c\u5247\u76ae\u819a\u7dfb\u5bc6\u8160\u7406\u9589\u585e\uff0c\u7384\u5e9c\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u885b\u6c23\u4e0d\u5f97\u6cc4\u8d8a\uff0c\u6545\u5916\u71b1\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u76db\u751f\u5167\u5bd2\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53a5\u6c23\u4e0a\u9006\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c23\u7a4d\u65bc\u80f8\u4e2d\u800c\u4e0d\u5beb\uff0c\u4e0d\u5beb\u5247\u6eab\u6c23\u53bb\uff0c\u5bd2\u7368\u7559\uff0c\u5247\u8840\u51dd\u6ce3\uff0c\u51dd\u5247\u8108\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u76db\u5927\u4ee5\u6fc7\uff0c\u6545\u4e2d\u5bd2\u3002 Emperor: I have heard that when yang is deficient, there is external cold and when yin is deficient, there is internal heat. When yang is abundant, there is external heat and when yin is abundant, there is internal cold. I do not know how it works. </p> <p>Huang Di (Yellow Emperor): Yang absorbs qi in the Middle Burner, warming the skin and keeping the muscles and flesh nourished. If cold qi remains outside, the Middle Burner will not open, leading to cold qi remaining outside and causing a chill. </p> <p>Emperor: How does yin deficiency lead to internal heat? </p> <p>Huang Di: It is caused by overwork or exhaustion, with body qi weakened and the qi of grain insufficient. The Middle Burner is not functioning properly, the Lower Burner is not open, the stomach qi is hot, and the heat rises to the chest cavity, causing internal heat. </p> <p>Emperor: How does yang excess cause external heat? </p> <p>Huang Di: If the Middle Burner is not functioning smoothly, the skin and muscles are tight and pores are closed, obstructing the orifices of the Mysterious Gate and preventing the release of defensive qi. This leads to external heat. </p> <p>Emperor: How does yin excess cause internal cold? </p> <p>Huang Di: The governing qi rises upwards, and cold qi accumulates in the chest while not being discharged, causing the dispersing qi to depart. With cold remaining alone, blood congeals and stagnates, leading to blocked blood vessels. The pulse becomes large and irregular, causing internal cold.</p> <p>10: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u8207\u967d\u5e76\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4ee5\u5e76\uff0c\u75c5\u5f62\u4ee5\u6210\uff0c\u523a\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u6b64\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u7d93\u96a7\uff0c\u53d6\u8840\u65bc\u71df\uff0c\u53d6\u6c23\u65bc\u885b\uff0c\u7528\u5f62\u54c9\uff0c\u56e0\u56db\u6642\u591a\u5c11\u9ad8\u4e0b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8840\u6c23\u4ee5\u5e76\uff0c\u75c5\u5f62\u4ee5\u6210\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u50be\uff0c\u88dc\u5beb\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5beb\u5be6\u8005\u6c23\u76db\u4e43\u5167\u937c\uff0c\u937c\u8207\u6c23\u4ff1\u5167\uff0c\u4ee5\u958b\u5176\u9580\u5982\u5229\u5176\u6236\uff0c\u937c\u8207\u6c23\u4ff1\u51fa\uff0c\u7cbe\u6c23\u4e0d\u50b7\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u4e43\u4e0b\uff0c\u5916\u9580\u4e0d\u9589\uff0c\u4ee5\u51fa\u5176\u75be\uff0c\u6416\u5927\u5176\u9053\uff0c\u5982\u5229\u5176\u8def\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5927\u5beb\uff0c\u5fc5\u5207\u800c\u51fa\uff0c\u5927\u6c23\u4e43\u5c48\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u865b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6301\u937c\u52ff\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u5176\u610f\uff0c\u5019\u547c\u5167\u937c\uff0c\u6c23\u51fa\u937c\u5165\uff0c\u937c\u7a7a\u56db\u585e\uff0c\u7cbe\u7121\u5f9e\u53bb\uff0c\u65b9\u5be6\u800c\u75be\u51fa\u937c\uff0c\u6c23\u5165\u937c\u51fa\uff0c\u71b1\u4e0d\u5f97\u9084\uff0c\u9589\u585e\u5176\u9580\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u5e03\u6563\uff0c\u7cbe\u6c23\u4e43\u5f97\u5b58\uff0c\u52d5\u6c23\u5019\u6642\uff0c\u8fd1\u6c23\u4e0d\u5931\uff0c\u9060\u6c23\u4e43\u4f86\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u8ffd\u4e4b\u3002 Emperor said: Yin and Yang are combined, blood and Qi are combined, the disease pattern is formed, what shall I do with needle?

Hua Bo said: Hold needle without placing it, establish its intention, wait for internal Qi to come out, needle enters Qi, space without a place for Qi to go, real and rush out the needle, Qi enters and exits from the needle, heat does not return, close its door, pathogenic Qi disperses, preciously Qi can stay, moving Qi according to time, near Qi does not get lost, far Qi comes, this is called pursuit.</p> <p>11: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u865b\u5be6\u8005\u6709\u5341\uff0c\u751f\u65bc\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u4e94\u8108\u8033\u3002\u592b\u5341\u4e8c\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u7686\u751f\u5176\u75c5\uff0c\u4eca\u592b\u5b50\u7368\u8a00\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u592b\u5341\u4e8c\u7d93\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u7d61\u4e09\u767e\u516d\u5341\u4e94\u7bc0\uff0c\u7bc0\u6709\u75c5\uff0c\u5fc5\u88ab\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u7686\u6709\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u5408\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u85cf\u8005\uff0c\u6545\u5f97\u516d\u5e9c\u8207\u70ba\u8868\u88cf\uff0c\u7d93\u7d61\u652f\u7bc0\uff0c\u5404\u751f\u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u6240\u5c45\uff0c\u96a8\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\u3002\u75c5\u5728\u8108\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u8840\u3002\u75c5\u5728\u8840\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u7d61\u3002\u75c5\u5728\u6c23\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u885b\u3002\u75c5\u5728\u8089\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u5206\u8089\u3002\u75c5\u5728\u7b4b\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u7b4b\u3002\u75c5\u5728\u9aa8\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u9aa8\u3002\u71d4\u937c\u52ab\u523a\u5176\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ca\u8207\u6025\u8005\u3002\u75c5\u5728\u9aa8\uff0c\u7120\u937c\u85e5\u71a8\u3002\u75c5\u4e0d\u77e5\u6240\u75db\uff0c\u5169\u8e7b\u70ba\u4e0a\u3002\u8eab\u5f62\u6709\u75db\uff0c\u4e5d\u5019\u83ab\u75c5\uff0c\u5247\u7e46\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u75db\u5728\u65bc\u5de6\u800c\u53f3\u8108\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5de8\u523a\u4e4b\u3002\u5fc5\u8b39\u5bdf\u5176\u4e5d\u5019\uff0c\u937c\u9053\u5099\u77e3\u3002 Emperor: The Master says that there are ten kinds of emptiness and reality. They are born in the Five Zang organs and the Five Vessels. The Twelve Channels and Vessels all give rise to disease, and now the Master speaks only of the Five Zang, while the Twelve Channels and Vessels are all connected with the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five points. When a point is diseased, it must be treated by the channels and vessels; the diseases of the channels and vessels all have emptiness and reality. How can they be unified? </p> <p>Duke Xiao asked: The Five Zang organs are the basis for the Six Depths and Reaches, and the Channels, Collaterals, and Points all give rise to emptiness and reality. Wherever the disease is located, one should treat it accordingly. Disease in the channel, treat with blood. Disease in the blood, treat with channels and collaterals. Disease in the Qi, treat with defense Qi. Disease in the flesh, treat with division of flesh. Disease in the sinews, treat with sinews. Disease in the bones, treat with bone-setting methods. With needle or knife, cut below and join with urgent cases. When disease is in the bones, use fire needles and medicine to warm. When the disease is not known where it hurts, use two needle techniques above. If there is pain on the left side and the right channel is diseased, use large needle techniques. Be sure to carefully observe the nine signs, and the method is secure.</p>"},{"location":"63_huangdi-neijing_mou-ci-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u7e46\u523a\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u7e46\u523a\uff0c\u672a\u5f97\u5176\u610f\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u7e46\u523a\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u90aa\u4e4b\u5ba2\u65bc\u5f62\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u820d\u65bc\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u7559\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u5165\u820d\u65bc\u5b6b\u8108\uff0c\u7559\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u5165\u820d\u65bc\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u7559\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u5165\u820d\u65bc\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u5167\u9023\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u6563\u65bc\u8178\u80c3\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4ff1\u611f\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u4e43\u50b7\uff0c\u6b64\u90aa\u4e4b\u5f9e\u76ae\u6bdb\u800c\u5165\uff0c\u6975\u65bc\u4e94\u85cf\u4e4b\u6b21\u4e5f\uff0c\u5982\u6b64\u5247\u6cbb\u5176\u7d93\u7109\u3002\u4eca\u90aa\u5ba2\u65bc\u76ae\u6bdb\uff0c\u5165\u820d\u65bc\u5b6b\u7d61\uff0c\u7559\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u9589\u585e\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u5165\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u6d41\u6ea2\u65bc\u5927\u7d61\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u5947\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u90aa\u5ba2\u5927\u7d61\u8005\uff0c\u5de6\u6ce8\u53f3\uff0c\u53f3\u6ce8\u5de6\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u8207\u7d93\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u800c\u5e03\u65bc\u56db\u672b\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u7121\u5e38\u8655\uff0c\u4e0d\u5165\u65bc\u7d93\u4fde\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u7e46\u523a\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u7e46\u523a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5de6\u53d6\u53f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53f3\u53d6\u5de6\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u5176\u8207\u5de8\u523a\u4f55\u4ee5\u5225\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u90aa\u5ba2\u65bc\u7d93\uff0c\u5de6\u76db\u5247\u53f3\u75c5\uff0c\u53f3\u76db\u5247\u5de6\u75c5\uff0c\u4ea6\u6709\u79fb\u6613\u8005\uff0c\u5de6\u75db\u672a\u5df2\u800c\u53f3\u8108\u5148\u75c5\uff0c\u5982\u6b64\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u5de8\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u5fc5\u4e2d\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u975e\u7d61\u8108\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u7d61\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u75db\u8207\u7d93\u8108\u7e46\u8655\uff0c\u6545\u547d\u66f0\u7e46\u523a\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: I have heard of needling, but I do not understand its meaning. What is needling? Hua Tuo replied: The pathogenic factor resides in the body and must first be abandoned at the skin and hair, leaving it without being removed, then entering and lodging in the grand yin channel, leaving it without being removed, then entering and lodging in the nutritive vessel channel, leaving it without being removed, then entering and connecting with the five organs, dispersing to the stomach and intestines, and both yin and yang are felt, and the five organs are damaged - this is where the pathogenic factor enters from the skin and hair and is most extreme in damaging the five organs. If so, then treat it by needling the channel. Now, the pathogenic factor resides in the skin and hair, entering and lodging in the grand and nutritive vessels, leaving without being removed, blocking and not passing through to the channel, overflowing to the great vessel, and giving rise to strange diseases. The pathogenic factor in the great vessel, left and right, up and down, left and right, meets with the channel at various points, spreading throughout the four extremities, its qi without a fixed location, not entering the channel orifice, and is called needling. Yellow Emperor asked: I wish to hear about needling, how can I use left to take from the right, and how is it different from the huge needle? Hua Tuo said: The pathogenic factor in the channel, if the left is full then the right is damaged, and if the right is full then the left is damaged, there are also those that move and change, with the left pain not yet subsiding while the right vessel is already damaged - this must be treated with a huge needle, must penetrate the channel, not the nutritive vessel. Therefore, diseases of the nutritive vessel have pain at the channel's needling point, so it is called needling.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u7e46\u523a\u67f0\u4f55\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u90aa\u5ba2\u65bc\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u7d61\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5352\u5fc3\u75db\u66b4\u8139\uff0c\u80f8\u8107\u652f\u6eff\uff0c\u7121\u7a4d\u8005\uff0c\u523a\u7136\u9aa8\u4e4b\u524d\u51fa\u8840\uff0c\u5982\u98df\u9803\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u4e0d\u5df2\uff0c\u5de6\u53d6\u53f3\uff0c\u53f3\u53d6\u5de6\uff0c\u75c5\u65b0\u767c\u8005\u53d6\u4e94\u65e5\u5df2\u3002 The emperor asked, I wish to hear about the method of puncturing a navel and how it is done. Oddly enough, the foreign guest said that when puncturing the navel, one should take care not to damage the small intestine. This can cause severe pain in the person's heart, leading to a bloated chest and abdomen. If there is no accumulation, the needle should be inserted at the front of the bone, causing bleeding. Within a short while, the procedure is complete. However, if it is not yet complete, one should take from the left and put on the right, or vice versa.

The Emperor said, I wish to hear about its origins. Huan Tui replied: Spring is when heavenly Qi begins to manifest and earthly Qi begins to disperse, melting ice and allowing waterways to flow freely. Therefore, human Qi resides in the meridians. Summer occurs when Qi fills the meridians and overflows into the sinews, nourishing the skin. Long summer is when the meridians and sinews are all abundant, with excess Qi flowing into the muscles. Autumn is when heavenly Qi begins to contract and the network of channels closes up, causing the skin to tighten. Winter is when things are hidden away, with Qi and blood in the center, settling into the bone marrow and connecting with the five organs. Thus, pathogenic Qi always follows the Qi and blood of the seasons and enters the body, changing and transforming in unpredictable ways. However, one must treat it by targeting its meridians and expelling its pathogenic influence. Once the pathogenic influence is expelled, disorderly Qi will not arise.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9006\u56db\u6642\u800c\u751f\u4e82\u6c23\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u523a\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u5916\u6ea2\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5c11\u6c23\u3002\u6625\u523a\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u74b0\u9006\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u4e0a\u6c23\u3002\u6625\u523a\u7b4b\u9aa8\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u5167\u8457\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u8179\u8139\u3002\u590f\u523a\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4e43\u7aed\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u89e3\u344a\u3002\u590f\u523a\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u5167\u537b\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5584\u6050\u3002\u590f\u523a\u7b4b\u9aa8\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4e0a\u9006\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5584\u6012\u3002\u79cb\u523a\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4e0a\u9006\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5584\u5fd8\u3002\u79cb\u523a\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u6c23\u4e0d\u5916\u884c\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u81e5\u4e0d\u6b32\u52d5\u3002\u79cb\u523a\u7b4b\u9aa8\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u5167\u6563\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5bd2\u6144\u3002\u51ac\u523a\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u7686\u812b\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u76ee\u4e0d\u660e\u3002\u51ac\u523a\u7d61\u8108\uff0c\u5167\u6c23\u5916\u6cc4\uff0c\u7559\u70ba\u5927\u75fa\u3002\u51ac\u523a\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u7aed\u7d55\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5584\u5fd8\u3002\u51e1\u6b64\u56db\u6642\u523a\u8005\u5927\u9006\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u5f9e\u4e5f\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u5247\u751f\u4e82\u6c23\u76f8\u6deb\u75c5\u7109\u3002\u6545\u523a\u4e0d\u77e5\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u7d93\uff0c\u75c5\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f9e\u70ba\u9006\uff0c\u6b63\u6c23\u5167\u4e82\uff0c\u8207\u7cbe\u76f8\u8584\uff0c\u5fc5\u5be9\u4e5d\u5019\uff0c\u6b63\u6c23\u4e0d\u4e82\uff0c\u7cbe\u6c23\u4e0d\u8f49\u3002 Emperor said: Inverse with the four seasons, resulting in chaotic qi, how come? Master Qi said: In spring, pierce the meridian, blood and qi overflow, causing people to have a shortage of qi. Pierce the muscles in spring, blood and qi flow counterclockwise, causing people to have too much qi. Pierce the bones and tendons in spring, blood and qi are inside, causing people to feel bloated. In summer, pierce the meridian, blood and qi exhaust, causing people to dissipate. Pierce the muscles in summer, blood and qi are inside, causing people to be easily frightened. Pierce the bones and tendons in summer, blood and qi are upside down, causing people to be prone to anger. In autumn, pierce the meridian, blood and qi are upside down, causing people to be prone to forgetfulness. Pierce the vessels in autumn, qi does not go outwards, causing people to want to lie down and not move. Pierce the bones and tendons in autumn, blood and qi are scattered inside, causing people to feel cold sweat. In winter, pierce the meridian, blood and qi all detach, causing people to have blurred vision. Pierce the vessels in winter, inner qi leaks outwards, leading to severe edema. Pierce the muscles in winter, Yang qi exhausts completely, causing people to be prone to forgetfulness. All diseases caused by piercing at these four seasons are great reversals that should not be ignored. On the contrary, they will generate chaotic qi and produce disorders such as diseases. Therefore, when piercing, one must know the meridians of the four seasons, where the disease comes from, treat it accordingly to reverse the qi, regulate the inner qi, and maintain the essence, avoiding nine possible manifestations and ensuring that qi does not become chaotic and jing does not transform.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u523a\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e00\u65e5\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u52d5\u70ba\u566b\u3002\u4e2d\u809d\u4e94\u65e5\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u52d5\u70ba\u8a9e\u3002\u4e2d\u80ba\u4e09\u65e5\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u52d5\u70ba\u6b2c\u3002\u4e2d\u814e\u516d\u65e5\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u52d5\u70ba\u568f\u6b20\u3002\u4e2d\u813e\u5341\u65e5\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u52d5\u70ba\u541e\u3002\u523a\u50b7\u4eba\u4e94\u85cf\u5fc5\u6b7b\uff0c\u5176\u52d5\uff0c\u5247\u4f9d\u5176\u85cf\u4e4b\u6240\u8b8a\u5019\u77e5\u5176\u6b7b\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said: Good.

If it strikes the lungs, one will die in three days, its movement becoming coughing and panting. If it strikes the kidneys, one will die in six days, its movement becoming coughing and gasping for breath. If it strikes the spleen, one will die in ten days, its movement becoming swallowing.

Thus it is said: In treating according to the standard and obtaining results from the standard, in treating according to the model and obtaining results from the model, in treating according to the locality and obtaining results from the standard, in treating according to the standard and obtaining results from the locality, there are those who succeed in obtaining results by following the standard, by following the locality, by taking what is inverse, and by taking what follows. Knowing inverse and following is essential for proper treatment; knowing the models and standards is essential for all actions and decisions; not knowing the models and standards leads to unwarranted action.</p> <p>2: \u592b\u9670\u967d\u9006\u5f9e\uff0c\u6a19\u672c\u4e4b\u70ba\u9053\u4e5f\uff0c\u5c0f\u800c\u5927\uff0c\u8a00\u4e00\u800c\u77e5\u767e\u75c5\u4e4b\u5bb3\uff0c\u5c11\u800c\u591a\uff0c\u6dfa\u800c\u535a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8a00\u4e00\u800c\u77e5\u767e\u4e5f\u3002\u4ee5\u6dfa\u800c\u77e5\u6df1\uff0c\u5bdf\u8fd1\u800c\u77e5\u9060\uff0c\u8a00\u6a19\u8207\u672c\uff0c\u6613\u800c\u52ff\u53ca\uff0c\u6cbb\u53cd\u70ba\u9006\uff0c\u6cbb\u5f97\u70ba\u5f9e\u3002\u5148\u75c5\u800c\u5f8c\u9006\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u9006\u800c\u5f8c\u75c5\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u5bd2\u800c\u5f8c\u751f\u75c5\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u75c5\u800c\u5f8c\u751f\u5bd2\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u71b1\u800c\u5f8c\u751f\u75c5\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u71b1\u800c\u5f8c\u751f\u4e2d\u6eff\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u6a19\uff0c\u5148\u75c5\u800c\u5f8c\u6cc4\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u6cc4\u800c\u5f8c\u751f\u4ed6\u75c5\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5fc5\u4e14\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e43\u6cbb\u5176\u4ed6\u75c5\uff0c\u5148\u75c5\u800c\u5f8c\u5148\u4e2d\u6eff\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u6a19\uff0c\u5148\u4e2d\u6eff\u800c\u5f8c\u7169\u5fc3\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\u3002\u4eba\u6709\u5ba2\u6c23\u6709\u540c\u6c23\uff0c\u5c0f\u5927\u4e0d\u5229\u6cbb\u5176\u6a19\uff0c\u5c0f\u5927\u5229\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\u3002\u75c5\u767c\u800c\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u672c\u800c\u6a19\u4e4b\uff0c\u5148\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\uff0c\u5f8c\u6cbb\u5176\u6a19\u3002\u75c5\u767c\u800c\u4e0d\u8db3\u6a19\u800c\u672c\u4e4b\uff0c\u5148\u6cbb\u5176\u6a19\u5f8c\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\u3002\u8b39\u5bdf\u9593\u751a\uff0c\u4ee5\u610f\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u9592\u8005\u5e76\u884c\uff0c\u751a\u8005\u7368\u884c\uff0c\u5148\u5c0f\u5927\u4e0d\u5229\u800c\u5f8c\u751f\u75c5\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u672c\u3002 Regarding yin and yang, the basic model is what the way is. Small yet all-encompassing, speaking of one thing can know a hundred diseases' harm, insufficient yet abundant, shallow yet extensive, it can be spoken of to know a hundred. Using the shallow to know the deep, observing close to know distant, speaking tags and roots, easy but not reaching, treating reversal as following, achieving it as following, first treating the disease and then the inverse, first treating the inverse and then the disease, first treating the cold and then causing disease, first treating the disease and then causing cold, first treating the heat and then causing disease, first treating the heat and then causing middle danger, first treating the disease and then expelling, first expelling and then causing other diseases, must certainly regulate it to treat other diseases. First treating the disease and then first middle danger, first treating middle danger and then disturbing the mind, treating the root.

I'll translate it into English as follows:</p> <p>For those who suffer from illness, the heart is first affected with palpitations, followed by difficulty in swallowing, after one day; pain on the sides and abdomen after three days; and complete blockage after five days. The body feels heavy, and the symptoms persist for three days before death, which may occur during winter nights or summer days.</p> <p>Lung disease is characterized by wheezing, followed by severe pain on the sides and abdomen after three days; difficulty in breathing after five days; and continued symptoms for ten days before death, which may occur during winter or summer.</p> <p>Liver disease manifests with dizziness and pain on the sides, becoming progressively worse over three days, and is followed by a bloated abdomen, then pain in the hips, lower back, and inner thighs after five days; pain in the waist, groin, and knees after three days; and persistent symptoms that may lead to death during winter or summer.</p> <p>Spleen disease causes body and limb pain, leading to bloating after one day; abdominal pain and lower back pain after two days; severe pain in the muscles around the hips and difficulty urinating after three days; and continued symptoms for ten days before death, which may occur during winter or summer.</p> <p>Kidney disease is characterized by pain in the lower abdomen, lower back, and loins, followed by bloating and pain on both sides of the waist after three days; pain in the flanks after three days; persistent symptoms that may lead to death during winter mornings or summer afternoons.</p> <p>Stomach disease causes bloating, followed by abdominal pain and lower back pain after five days; severe pain in the muscles around the hips and difficulty urinating after five days; and a feeling of heaviness throughout the body after six days, leading to death during winter nights or summer days.</p> <p>Bladder disease results in difficulty urinating, followed by abdominal pain, lower back pain, and chills after five days; abdominal bloating after one day; and body pain that persists for two days before death, which may occur during winter cockcrow or summer afternoons.</p> <p>In summary, the different stages of diseases are characterized by distinct symptoms, and those who reach these stages have a fixed time to live. Acupuncture should not be performed in such cases. However, after an interval of one to four days, acupuncture may be applied for those who do not show any signs of recovery.</p>"},{"location":"66_huangdi-neijing_tian-yuan-ji-da-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u5929\u5143\u7d00\u5927\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u6709\u4e94\u884c\uff0c\u5fa1\u4e94\u4f4d\u4ee5\u751f\u5bd2\u6691\u71e5\u6fd5\u98a8\uff0c\u4eba\u6709\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u5316\u4e94\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u559c\u6012\u601d\u6182\u6050\uff0c\u8ad6\u8a00\u4e94\u904b\u76f8\u8972\u800c\u7686\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u7d42\u671e\u4e4b\u65e5\uff0c\u5468\u800c\u5fa9\u59cb\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u8207\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\u4e4b\u5019\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u5408\u4e4b\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u7a3d\u9996\u518d\u62dc\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u662d\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u4e94\u904b\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4e4b\u7db1\u7d00\uff0c\u8b8a\u5316\u4e4b\u7236\u6bcd\uff0c\u751f\u6bba\u4e4b\u672c\u59cb\uff0c\u795e\u660e\u4e4b\u5e9c\u4e5f\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0d\u901a\u4e4e\u3002\u6545\u7269\u751f\u8b02\u4e4b\u5316\uff0c\u7269\u6975\u8b02\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e0d\u6e2c\u8b02\u4e4b\u795e\uff0c\u795e\u7528\u7121\u65b9\u8b02\u4e4b\u8056\u3002\u592b\u8b8a\u5316\u4e4b\u70ba\u7528\u4e5f\uff0c\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u7384\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u70ba\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u5316\uff0c\u5316\u751f\u4e94\u5473\uff0c\u9053\u751f\u667a\uff0c\u7384\u751f\u795e\u3002\u795e\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u98a8\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u6728\uff0c\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u71b1\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u706b\uff0c\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u6fd5\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u571f\uff0c\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u71e5\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u91d1\uff0c\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u5bd2\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u6c34\uff0c\u6545\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u6c23\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u5f62\u6c23\u76f8\u611f\u800c\u5316\u751f\u842c\u7269\u77e3\u3002\u7136\u5929\u5730\u8005\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u4e4b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e5f\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u9053\u8def\u4e5f\u3002\u6c34\u706b\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u5fb5\u5146\u4e5f\uff0c\u91d1\u6728\u8005\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u7d42\u59cb\u4e5f\u3002\u6c23\u6709\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u5f62\u6709\u76db\u8870\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u76f8\u53ec\uff0c\u800c\u640d\u76ca\u5f70\u77e3\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: There are five phases of Heaven, which govern the five emotions through the cycle of cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind. Human beings have five organs that transform the five energies to generate happiness, anger, thought, worry, and fear. You discuss how the five phases mutually overthrow each other and ultimately restore to a beginning. I already know this. My question is, may I ask about the situation of Yin and Yang? Ghost Valuable Region kowtowed and paid homage, answering: How enlightening your question is! The five phases of Yin and Yang are the Dao of Heaven and Earth. They are the basis for the evolution and transformation of all things. Materials are generated when they transform, and they reach their extremes when they change. The Yin and Yang cannot be measured. When there is no method, it is called Sage. The transformation is the function of Heaven, the path of human beings is the Dao, and the manifestation of Earth is the formation. The formation generates the five flavors, the Dao generates wisdom, and the mysterious generates spirit. Spirit in Heaven is wind, in Earth is wood, in Heaven is heat, in Earth is fire, in Heaven is dampness, in Earth is soil, in Heaven is dryness, in Earth is metal, in Heaven is cold, in Earth is water. Therefore, in Heaven it is qi, and on Earth it becomes shape. The qi and shape mutually inspire and generate all things. However, the levels of Heaven and Earth are the basis for all things. Left and right are the paths of Yin and Yang. Fire and water are the indicators of Yin and Yang. Wood and metal are the beginnings and ends of generation. The qi has abundance or decline, and shape has prosperity or decay, and they call forth each other, causing profit and loss to be evident.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u4e94\u904b\u4e4b\u4e3b\u6642\u4e5f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u6c23\u904b\u884c\uff0c\u5404\u7d42\u671e\u65e5\uff0c\u975e\u7368\u4e3b\u6642\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8acb\u805e\u5176\u6240\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u81e3\u7a4d\u300a\u8003\u592a\u59cb\u5929\u5143\u518a\u300b\u6587\u66f0\uff1a\u592a\u865b\u5ed6\u5ed3\uff0c\u8087\u57fa\u5316\u5143\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u8cc7\u59cb\uff0c\u4e94\u904b\u7d42\u5929\uff0c\u5e03\u6c23\u771f\u9748\uff0c\u6460\u7d71\u5764\u5143\uff0c\u4e5d\u661f\u61f8\u6717\uff0c\u4e03\u66dc\u5468\u65cb\uff0c\u66f0\u9670\u66f0\u967d\uff0c\u66f0\u67d4\u66f0\u525b\uff0c\u5e7d\u986f\u65e2\u4f4d\uff0c\u5bd2\u6691\u5f1b\u5f35\uff0c\u751f\u751f\u5316\u5316\uff0c\u54c1\u7269\u54b8\u7ae0\u3002\u81e3\u65af\u5341\u4e16\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u4f55\u8b02\u6c23\u6709\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u5f62\u6709\u76db\u8870\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u6c23\u5404\u6709\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\u4e5f\u3002\u5f62\u6709\u76db\u8870\uff0c\u8b02\u4e94\u884c\u4e4b\u6cbb\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u592a\u904e\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u5176\u59cb\u4e5f\uff0c\u6709\u9918\u800c\u5f80\u4e0d\u8db3\u96a8\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5f80\u6709\u9918\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u77e5\u8fce\u77e5\u96a8\uff0c\u6c23\u53ef\u8207\u671f\u3002\u61c9\u5929\u70ba\u5929\u7b26\uff0c\u627f\u6b72\u70ba\u6b72\u76f4\uff0c\u4e09\u5408\u70ba\u6cbb\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u76f8\u53ec\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u5bd2\u6691\u71e5\u6fd5\u98a8\u706b\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\u4e0a\u5949\u4e4b\u3002\u6728\u706b\u571f\u91d1\u6c34\u706b\uff0c\u5730\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u751f\u9577\u5316\u6536\u85cf\u4e0b\u61c9\u4e4b\u3002\u5929\u4ee5\u967d\u751f\u9670\u9577\uff0c\u5730\u4ee5\u967d\u6bba\u9670\u85cf\u3002\u5929\u6709\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5730\u4ea6\u6709\u9670\u967d\u3002\u6728\u706b\u571f\u91d1\u6c34\u706b\uff0c\u5730\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u751f\u9577\u5316\u6536\u85cf\u3002\u6545\u967d\u4e2d\u6709\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u4e2d\u6709\u967d\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6b32\u77e5\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u61c9\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u52d5\u800c\u4e0d\u606f\uff0c\u6545\u4e94\u6b72\u800c\u53f3\u9077\uff0c\u61c9\u5730\u4e4b\u6c23\u975c\u800c\u5b88\u4f4d\uff0c\u6545\u516d\u671e\u800c\u74b0\u6703\u3002\u52d5\u975c\u76f8\u53ec\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u76f8\u81e8\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u932f\uff0c\u800c\u8b8a\u7531\u751f\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor said: I wish to hear about the master of the five cycles. Ghost Officer Liu Zhao said: The Five Qi are in motion, each at its terminal point, so it is not just one master time. Emperor said: Please tell me what that means. Ghost Officer Liu Zhao said: I have compiled the Examination of the Primordial Heaven from the Classic of the Great Beginning. The Voidly Profound, originating the myriad things, the Five Cycles complete heaven, spreading the true spirits, ruling the elemental foundation, the nine stars hang bright, the seven planets revolve, speaking yin and yang, soft and hard, profoundly manifest, cold and heat stretch and contract, generation and decay transforming, all things are categorized. This is what I mean by the tenth [generation]. Emperor said: Good. What do you mean by Qi has how much, form has how much abundance and decline? Ghost Officer Liu Zhao said: The yin and yang qi of yin and yang each have different amounts, so it is called three yins and three yangs. Form has abundance and decline, referring to the treatment of the Five Phases, each having an excess that does not follow, and a deficiency that cannot keep up with following, knowing to meet and know to accompany, qi can be matched accordingly. Responding to heaven as heaven's pattern, conforming to the year as the year's straightness, three harmony as governance. Emperor said: How do above and below call upon each other? Ghost Officer Liu Zhao said: Cold, heat, dryness, humidity, and wind are heaven's yin and yang, and the three yins and three yangs ascend to them. Wood, fire, earth, metal, water, and fire are the land's yin and yang, giving birth to growth and transforming, storing and collecting down following it. Heaven has yin and yang, and the earth also has yin and yang. The wood, fire, earth, metal, water, and fire of the land's yin and yang give birth to growth and transformation. Therefore, within yang there is yin, and within yin there is yang. To know the transformations of heaven and earth's yin and yang, it responds to heaven's qi movement that never stops, so five [cycles] right shift, responding to earth's qi stillness and guarding position, six cycles revolve and gather. Movement and stillness call upon each other, above and below confront each other, yin and yang intertwine, and change arises from generation.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5468\u7d00\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u6578\u4e4e\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u4ee5\u516d\u70ba\u7bc0\uff0c\u5730\u4ee5\u4e94\u70ba\u5236\u3002\u5468\u5929\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u516d\u671e\u70ba\u4e00\u5099\uff0c\u7d42\u5730\u7d00\u8005\uff0c\u4e94\u6b72\u70ba\u4e00\u5468\u3002\u541b\u706b\u4ee5\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u706b\u4ee5\u4f4d\u3002\u4e94\u516d\u76f8\u5408\u800c\u4e03\u767e\u4e8c\u5341\u6c23\uff0c\u70ba\u4e00\u7d00\uff0c\u51e1\u4e09\u5341\u6b72\uff0c\u5343\u56db\u767e\u56db\u5341\u6c23\uff0c\u51e1\u516d\u5341\u6b72\uff0c\u800c\u70ba\u4e00\u5468\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ca\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u65af\u7686\u898b\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u4e4b\u8a00\uff0c\u4e0a\u7d42\u5929\u6c23\uff0c\u4e0b\u7562\u5730\u7d00\uff0c\u53ef\u8b02\u6089\u77e3\u3002\u4f59\u9858\u805e\u800c\u85cf\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0a\u4ee5\u6cbb\u6c11\uff0c\u4e0b\u4ee5\u6cbb\u8eab\uff0c\u4f7f\u767e\u59d3\u662d\u8457\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u548c\u89aa\uff0c\u5fb7\u6fa4\u4e0b\u6d41\uff0c\u5b50\u5b6b\u7121\u6182\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u5f8c\u4e16\uff0c\u7121\u6709\u7d42\u6642\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u805e\u4e4e\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u81f3\u6578\u4e4b\u6a5f\uff0c\u8feb\u8fee\u4ee5\u5fae\uff0c\u5176\u4f86\u53ef\u898b\uff0c\u5176\u5f80\u53ef\u8ffd\uff0c\u656c\u4e4b\u8005\u660c\uff0c\u6162\u4e4b\u8005\u4ea1\uff0c\u7121\u9053\u884c\u79c1\uff0c\u5fc5\u5f97\u5929\u6b83\uff0c\u8b39\u5949\u5929\u9053\uff0c\u8acb\u8a00\u771f\u8981\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u8a00\u59cb\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u6703\u65bc\u7d42\uff0c\u5584\u8a00\u8fd1\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u77e5\u5176\u9060\uff0c\u662f\u5247\u81f3\u6578\u6975\u800c\u9053\u4e0d\u60d1\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u660e\u77e3\u3002\u9858\u592b\u5b50\u63a8\u800c\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee4\u6709\u689d\u7406\uff0c\ud857\udcd1\u800c\u4e0d\u5331\uff0c\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u7d55\uff0c\u6613\u7528\u96e3\u5fd8\uff0c\u70ba\u4e4b\u7db1\u7d00\uff0c\u81f3\u6578\u4e4b\u8981\uff0c\u9858\u76e1\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u662d\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\uff0c\u660e\u4e4e\u54c9\u9053\uff0c\u5982\u9f13\u4e4b\u61c9\u6874\uff0c\u97ff\u4e4b\u61c9\u8072\u4e5f\u3002\u81e3\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u7532\u5df1\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u571f\u904b\u7d71\u4e4b\u3002\u4e59\u5e9a\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u91d1\u904b\u7d71\u4e4b\u3002\u4e19\u8f9b\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u7d71\u4e4b\u3002\u4e01\u58ec\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u6728\u904b\u7d71\u4e4b\u3002\u620a\u7678\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u706b\u904b\u7d71\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u65bc\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\uff0c\u5408\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u5b50\u5348\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u5c11\u9670\u3002\u4e11\u672a\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u592a\u9670\u3002\u5bc5\u7533\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u5c11\u967d\u3002\u536f\u9149\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u967d\u660e\u3002\u8fb0\u620c\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u592a\u967d\u3002\u5df3\u4ea5\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u53a5\u9670\u3002\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u6a19\u4e5f\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u7d42\u4e5f\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u98a8\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u71b1\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u6fd5\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u706b\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u71e5\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u672c\u4e5f\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u516d\u5143\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5149\u4e4e\u54c9\u9053\uff0c\u660e\u4e4e\u54c9\u8ad6\uff0c\u8acb\u8457\u4e4b\u7389\u7248\uff0c\u85cf\u4e4b\u91d1\u5331\uff0c\u7f72\u66f0\u5929\u5143\u7d00\u3002 The Emperor said: Above and below observe the cycles, do they have a number? Guan Yinqianzi replied: Heaven uses six as nodes, and Earth uses five as measures. The cycle of Heavenly energy is six palaces, and the cycle of Earthly records is five generations. Fire illuminates what is bright, and corresponding fire establishes position. When the Five and Six are combined, there are 720 energies, which make up a cycle. At the age of thirty, one has completed 1040 energies, and at sixty, one completes a full cycle, and none will be lacking, seen clearly. The Emperor said: Your words, sir, have fully explained Heaven's energy above and Earth's records below. I wish to listen and preserve them, so that they may govern the people above and manage my body below, enlightening the masses, harmonizing above and below, cultivating virtue that flows downward, sons and grandsons will not worry, and the teaching can be passed down through future generations, without end, may I hear it? Guan Yinqianzi replied: The cycle of numbers has a machine-like precision. The subtle and near are obvious, and at its extreme, the way is not confused. This is what is meant by clarity. The Emperor ordered that Confucius should elaborate on this, so that there will be a clear structure, not incomplete, lasting but never ending, easy to remember, and serve as a reference for future generations. Guan Yinqianzi said: How bright and clear is the way! Like the response of the gu in answering the diao, resonating with the sound. I have heard it since the year Jiazi, the Year of Earth Tiger. In the year Gengxu, the Year of Metal Hare, it was the Year of Wood Dragon. The Emperor asked: How do the three Yin and three Yang merge? Guan Yinqianzi replied: In the years of Ji, the Emperor saw a deficiency in Yin below. In the year Gengyin, he saw too much Yin above. In the year Bingchen, he saw too much Yang above. In the year Dinghai, he saw a deficiency of Yin below. The six elements are the root of all things.</p>"},{"location":"67_huangdi-neijing_wu-yun-xing-da-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u4e94\u904b\u884c\u5927\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u5750\u660e\u5802\uff0c\u59cb\u6b63\u5929\u7db1\uff0c\u81e8\u89c0\u516b\u6975\uff0c\u8003\u5efa\u4e94\u5e38\uff0c\u8acb\u5929\u5e2b\u800c\u554f\u4e4b\u66f0\uff1a\u8ad6\u8a00\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u52d5\u975c\uff0c\u795e\u660e\u70ba\u4e4b\u7d00\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u5347\u964d\uff0c\u5bd2\u6691\u5f70\u5176\u5146\u3002\u4f59\u805e\u4e94\u904b\u4e4b\u6578\u65bc\u592b\u5b50\uff0c\u592b\u5b50\u4e4b\u6240\u8a00\uff0c\u6b63\u4e94\u6c23\u4e4b\u5404\u4e3b\u6b72\u723e\uff0c\u9996\u7532\u5b9a\u904b\uff0c\u4f59\u56e0\u8ad6\u4e4b\u3002\u9b3c\u81fe\u5340\u66f0\uff1a\u571f\u4e3b\u7532\u5df1\uff0c\u91d1\u4e3b\u4e59\u5e9a\uff0c\u6c34\u4e3b\u4e19\u8f9b\uff0c\u6728\u4e3b\u4e01\u58ec\uff0c\u706b\u4e3b\u620a\u7678\u3002\u5b50\u5348\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u4e11\u672a\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u5bc5\u7533\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u536f\u9149\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u8fb0\u620c\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u5df3\u4ea5\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u4e0d\u5408\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u662f\u660e\u9053\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b64\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u6578\u8005\uff0c\u4eba\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u7136\u6240\u5408\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u5f97\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u5341\uff0c\u63a8\u4e4b\u53ef\u767e\uff0c\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u5343\uff0c\u63a8\u4e4b\u53ef\u842c\u3002\u5929\u5730\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ee5\u6578\u63a8\u4ee5\u8c61\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002 The Yellow Emperor sat in the Hall of Illumination and first established the principles, observed the Eight Poles, investigated the Five Constants, and asked the celestial master about it. The subject was discussing the movement and rest of heaven and earth, recording the activities of spirits, and examining the rise and fall of yin and yang, clearly revealing the signs of cold and heat. I have heard that the five phases are spoken of by Confucius, and Confucius' words are in accord with the regulation of the five forces each year. Therefore, based on this, Guidi Zone said: The earth is ruled by yin, metal is governed by yin in the years of ji and geng; gold is ruled by yin in the years of ren and geng; water is governed by yin in the years of bing and ding; wood is governed by yin in the years of wu and xin; fire is governed by yin in the years of jia and yi. In the day of yang, the lesser yang prevails. At night, the greater yin prevails. During the day of xu, the yin spirit prevails. During the night of chou, the great yin prevails. During the day of bing, the hidden yin prevails. Why do yin and yang not harmonize? Tongwang said: This is due to the understanding of the clear way, which is the yin and yang of heaven and earth. The numbers can be counted among people, but the harmony of yin and yang cannot be calculated. Yin and yang can reach ten in numbers, be pushed to a hundred, and be pushed to a thousand, but the yin and yang of heaven and earth are not measured by numbers but by signs.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6240\u59cb\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u662d\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u81e3\u89bd\u300a\u592a\u59cb\u5929\u5143\u518a\u300b\u6587\uff0c\u4e39\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u7d93\u4e8e\u725b\u5973\u620a\u5206\uff0c\u9ec5\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u7d93\u4e8e\u5fc3\u5c3e\u5df1\u5206\uff0c\u84bc\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u7d93\u4e8e\u5371\u5ba4\u67f3\u9b3c\uff0c\u7d20\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u7d93\u4e8e\u4ea2\u6c10\u6634\u7562\uff0c\u7384\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u7d93\u4e8e\u5f35\u7ffc\u5a41\u80c3\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u620a\u5df1\u5206\u8005\uff0c\u594e\u58c1\u89d2\u8eeb\uff0c\u5247\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u9580\u6236\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u5019\u4e4b\u6240\u59cb\uff0c\u9053\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u901a\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said, I wish to hear its beginning.

However, I still do not know what it means. Zhong Feng replied: By up and down, we refer to seeing where yin and yang are found in a year's cycle. As for left and right, when looking at above, we see that the left is Shao Yin and the right is Tai Yang. When looking at Shao Yin, the left is Tai Yin and the right is Jue Yin. When looking at Tai Yin, the left is Shao Hong and the right is Shao Yin. When looking at Shao Hong, the left is Yang Ming and the right is Da Yin. When looking at Yang Ming, the left is Tai Yang and the right is Shao Hong. When looking at Tai Yang, the left is Jue Yin and the right is Yang Ming. By facing north, we determine its position; this refers to seeing it. Emperor asked: What do you mean by down? Zhong Feng replied: If Jue Yin is above, then Shao Hong is below, with Tai Yang on the left and Da Yin on the right. If Shao Yin is above, then Yang Ming is below, with Tai Yang on the left and Jue Yin on the right. If Tai Yin is above, then Tai Yang is below, with Jue Yin on the left and Yang Ming on the right. If Shao Hong is above, then Jue Yin is below, with Shao Yin on the left and Tai Yang on the right. If Yang Ming is above, then Shao Yin is below, with Tai Yin on the left and Jue Yin on the right. If Tai Yang is above, then Tai Yin is below, with Jue Yin on the left and Shao Hong on the right. By facing south, we determine its position; this refers to seeing it. Up and down complement each other, while cold and heat follow in turn, allowing the qi to harmonize and causing disease if they do not. Emperor asked: What is it when the qi are harmonious but still cause disease? Zhong Feng replied: When yin is below and yang is above, it is not properly positioned. Emperor asked: How about the dynamic and static aspects? Zhong Feng replied: Above moves to the right, while below moves to the left, circling heaven and earth and returning to the beginning. Emperor said: I have heard that in the Lingbao Scripture, it says appropriate to the land. Now, Master Zhong Feng has spoken of the concept of below as moving to the left, but I still do not understand what you mean, and I wish to hear how it generates life. Zhong Feng replied: The movement of heaven and earth, the transformation of the five phases, although the Lingbao Scripture provides a pattern for this, it cannot fully illuminate the matter. The utility of change lies in the refining power of heaven, the shaping force of earth, and the interweaving of the seven celestial stems and the empty spaces within the five phases. Earth supports the generation and manifestation of the myriad forms of life. Emptiness is what allows the celestial qi to be distributed. The movement of form and qi is like the root and branches, which can be observed from afar if one studies their patterns.</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5730\u4e4b\u70ba\u4e0b\uff0c\u5426\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5730\u70ba\u4eba\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u592a\u865b\u4e4b\u4e2d\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u99ae\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5927\u6c23\u8209\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u71e5\u4ee5\u4e7e\u4e4b\uff0c\u6691\u4ee5\u84b8\u4e4b\uff0c\u98a8\u4ee5\u52d5\u4e4b\uff0c\u6fd5\u4ee5\u6f64\u4e4b\uff0c\u5bd2\u4ee5\u5805\u4e4b\uff0c\u706b\u4ee5\u6eab\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u98a8\u5bd2\u5728\u4e0b\uff0c\u71e5\u71b1\u5728\u4e0a\uff0c\u6fd5\u6c23\u5728\u4e2d\uff0c\u706b\u904a\u884c\u5176\u9592\uff0c\u5bd2\u6691\u516d\u5165\uff0c\u6545\u4ee4\u865b\u800c\u751f\u5316\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u71e5\u52dd\u5247\u5730\u4e7e\uff0c\u6691\u52dd\u5247\u5730\u71b1\uff0c\u98a8\u52dd\u5247\u5730\u52d5\uff0c\u6fd5\u52dd\u5247\u5730\u6ce5\uff0c\u5bd2\u52dd\u5247\u5730\u88c2\uff0c\u706b\u52dd\u5247\u5730\u56fa\u77e3\u3002 The Emperor said: Is it below? Hui B\u00f3 said: The ground is below, referring to the extremely subtle. The Emperor said: Ah. Hui B\u00f3 said: It is raised by the great Qi. It dries with Qian, heats with Ding, moves with Xun, moistens with Rich, strengthens with Zhen, and warms with Li. Therefore, cold and heat are below, dryness above, moisture in the middle, fire freely moves about, cold and heat enter six times, hence it is born from emptiness. Therefore, if dryness prevails, the ground becomes dry; if heat prevails, the ground becomes hot; if wind prevails, the ground becomes moving; if moisture prevails, the ground becomes muddy; if cold prevails, the ground cracks; if fire prevails, the ground hardens.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u5019\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u52dd\u5fa9\u4e4b\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f62\u65bc\u8a3a\u4e5f\u3002\u300a\u8108\u6cd5\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u7121\u4ee5\u8108\u8a3a\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9592\u6c23\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u96a8\u6c23\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u671f\u65bc\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u671f\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5f9e\u5176\u6c23\u5247\u548c\uff0c\u9055\u5176\u6c23\u5247\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u7576\u5176\u4f4d\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u8fed\u79fb\u5176\u4f4d\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u5931\u5b88\u5176\u4f4d\u8005\u5371\uff0c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53cd\u8005\u6b7b\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4ea4\u8005\u6b7b\u3002\u5148\u7acb\u5176\u5e74\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u61c9\u898b\uff0c\u7136\u5f8c\u4e43\u53ef\u4ee5\u8a00\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u9006\u9806\u3002 Emperor: What is the qi of heaven and earth like? How can it be used to predict? Hui Bao: The qi of heaven and earth is the master of change, and does not take shape in divination. (The Classic of Pulse) says: There is no way to divine the changes of heaven and earth through the pulse; this is what it refers to. Emperor: What is the idle qi like? Hui Bao: It follows where the qi is, and waits to the left or right. Emperor: How long should one wait? Hui Bao: If it is in harmony with the qi, it is healthy; if it deviates from the qi, it is sick. If someone is not in their proper place, they are sick. If they keep changing places, they are in danger. If the pulse is reversed, they will die. If yin and yang are mixed up, they will die. First, establish their age to understand their qi, and then the left and right should be observed. Only then can one speak of the order of life and death.</p> <p>6: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5bd2\u6691\u71e5\u6fd5\u98a8\u706b\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u5408\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\uff0c\u5176\u65bc\u842c\u7269\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u751f\u5316\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6771\u65b9\u751f\u98a8\uff0c\u98a8\u751f\u6728\uff0c\u6728\u751f\u9178\uff0c\u9178\u751f\u809d\uff0c\u809d\u751f\u7b4b\uff0c\u7b4b\u751f\u5fc3\u3002\u5176\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u7384\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u70ba\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u5316\u3002\u5316\u751f\u4e94\u5473\uff0c\u9053\u751f\u667a\uff0c\u7384\u751f\u795e\uff0c\u5316\u751f\u6c23\u3002\u795e\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u98a8\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u6728\uff0c\u5728\u9ad4\u70ba\u7b4b\uff0c\u5728\u6c23\u70ba\u67d4\uff0c\u5728\u85cf\u70ba\u809d\u3002\u5176\u6027\u70ba\u6684\uff0c\u5176\u5fb7\u70ba\u548c\uff0c\u5176\u7528\u70ba\u52d5\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u70ba\u84bc\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u70ba\u69ae\uff0c\u5176\u87f2\u6bdb\uff0c\u5176\u653f\u70ba\u6563\uff0c\u5176\u4ee4\u5ba3\u767c\uff0c\u5176\u8b8a\u6467\u62c9\uff0c\u5176\u771a\u70ba\u9695\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u70ba\u9178\uff0c\u5176\u5fd7\u70ba\u6012\u3002\u6012\u50b7\u809d\uff0c\u60b2\u52dd\u6012\uff0c\u98a8\u50b7\u809d\uff0c\u71e5\u52dd\u98a8\uff0c\u9178\u50b7\u7b4b\uff0c\u8f9b\u52dd\u9178\u3002 The Emperor asked: Cold, heat, dryness, dampness, and wind - how do they interact with humans? What role do they play in the myriad things, by which do they give rise to life? The Duke of Ting replied: In the east there is wind; wind gives rise to wood; wood gives rise to sourness; sourness gives rise to the liver; the liver gives rise to tendons; tendons give rise to the heart. It exists in Heaven as mystery, in humans as the Way, and on Earth as transformation. Transformation gives rise to the five flavors, the Way gives rise to wisdom, mystery gives rise to spirit, and transformation gives rise to Qi. Spirit exists in Heaven as wind, on Earth as wood, within the body as tendons, within Qi as softness, and in the storehouse as the liver. Its nature is expansive; its virtue is harmonious; its function is movement; its color is blue; its transformation is glory; its insects and hairs are dispersed; its decree is announced and broadcasted; its changes are broken; its shadow is a meteor; its flavor is sour; its will is anger. Anger injures the liver, sorrow surpasses anger, wind injures the liver, dryness surpasses wind, sourness injures muscles, bitter surpasses sour.</p> <p>7: \u5357\u65b9\u751f\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u751f\u706b\uff0c\u706b\u751f\u82e6\uff0c\u82e6\u751f\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u751f\u8840\uff0c\u8840\u751f\u813e\u3002\u5176\u5728\u5929\u70ba\u71b1\uff0c\u5728\u5730\u70ba\u706b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad4\u70ba\u8108\uff0c\u5728\u6c23\u70ba\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u85cf\u70ba\u5fc3\u3002\u5176\u6027\u70ba\u6691\uff0c\u5176\u5fb7\u70ba\u986f\uff0c\u5176\u7528\u70ba\u8e81\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u70ba\u8d64\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u70ba\u8302\uff0c\u5176\u87f2\u7fbd\uff0c\u5176\u653f\u70ba\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u4ee4\u9b31\u84b8\uff0c\u5176\u8b8a\u708e\u720d\uff0c\u5176\u771a\u71d4\u712b\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u70ba\u82e6\uff0c\u5176\u5fd7\u70ba\u559c\u3002\u559c\u50b7\u5fc3\uff0c\u6050\u52dd\u559c\uff0c\u71b1\u50b7\u6c23\uff0c\u5bd2\u52dd\u71b1\uff0c\u82e6\u50b7\u6c23\uff0c\u9e79\u52dd\u82e6\u3002 In the southern regions, warmth is generated, heat generates fire, fire generates bitterness, bitterness generates the heart, the heart generates blood, and blood generates the spleen.

The emperor asked: How does one handle a crisis year? Zhouzi said: If there is an abundance of qi, one governs oneself by excelling where one is not strong and ignoring where one is weak; if one cannot do so, one ignores where one is weak and takes advantage of where one is strong, but treats the strong areas lightly and ignores them. Ignoring leads to evil, taking advantage of the weak while ignoring the strong also leads to evil; fearing this is the least among faults.

Yang Ming governs above, treating with dry Qi; in the middle, one sees Tai Yin. Tai Yang governs above, treating with cold Qi; in the middle, one sees Shao Yin. Jue Yin governs above, treating with wind Qi; in the middle, one sees Shao Yang. Shao Yin governs above, treating with hot Qi; in the middle, one sees Tai Yang. Tai Yin governs above, treating with damp Qi; in the middle, one sees Yang Ming. What is called the origin is above. The origin is below; in the middle, one sees the marker.

And what is the meaning of arriving beyond the limit?  Duke Huan replied: Arriving and being in harmony is arrived. Not arriving, it means insufficient qi. Not yet arrived but already there, the qi has excess. The Emperor asked again: Not arriving when one should have arrived, and arriving before one should, how is this? Duke Huan replied: It is like obeying the proper time and acting accordingly; otherwise it will be reversed, leading to a change in generation and causing disease. The Emperor said: Good. Please explain more about what is appropriate. Duke Huan said: Everything has its appropriate time.

I wish to hear about the six qi positions in geomancy. Gobi said: The position of the displaying brightness is on the right, which represents the fire of the sovereign. To the right of the sovereign fire, retreat one step and treat the soil qi, then advance one step and treat the metal qi, then advance one step and treat the water qi, then advance one step and treat the wood qi, then retreat one step and treat the sovereign fire again. Underneath the fire phase, the water qi is borne. Underneath the water phase, the soil qi is borne. Underneath the earth phase, the wind qi is borne. Underneath the wind phase, the metal qi is borne. Underneath the metal phase, the fire qi is borne. Underneath the sovereign fire, the yin spirit nourishes. The emperor asked: What does this mean? Gobi said: If it rises and causes damage, it can be regulated and controlled, and regulation and control will lead to life-giving energy. Outwardly, there are fluctuations between prosperity and decline, but if it causes damage, it will lead to chaos, and a serious illness of life-giving energy will occur.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u76db\u8870\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u975e\u5176\u4f4d\u5247\u90aa\uff0c\u7576\u5176\u4f4d\u5247\u6b63\uff0c\u90aa\u5247\u8b8a\u751a\uff0c\u6b63\u5247\u5fae\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u7576\u4f4d\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6728\u904b\u81e8\u536f\uff0c\u706b\u904b\u81e8\u5348\uff0c\u571f\u904b\u81e8\u56db\u5b63\uff0c\u91d1\u904b\u81e8\u9149\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u81e8\u5b50\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u6b72\u6703\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u5e73\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u975e\u4f4d\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b72\u4e0d\u8207\u6703\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u571f\u904b\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u706b\u904b\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u5c11\u967d\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u91d1\u904b\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u6728\u904b\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u53a5\u9670\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e0a\u898b\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u4e4b\u8207\u6703\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u300a\u5929\u5143\u518a\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u7b26\u3002\u5929\u7b26\u6b72\u6703\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592a\u4e00\u5929\u7b26\u4e4b\u6703\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u8cb4\u8ce4\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u7b26\u70ba\u57f7\u6cd5\uff0c\u6b72\u4f4d\u70ba\u884c\u4ee4\uff0c\u592a\u4e00\u5929\u7b26\u70ba\u8cb4\u4eba\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u90aa\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e2d\u57f7\u6cd5\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u901f\u800c\u5371\u3002\u4e2d\u884c\u4ee4\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u5f90\u800c\u7279\u3002\u4e2d\u8cb4\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u66b4\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f4d\u4e4b\u6613\u4e5f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u541b\u4f4d\u81e3\u5247\u9806\uff0c\u81e3\u4f4d\u541b\u5247\u9006\uff0c\u9006\u5247\u5176\u75c5\u8fd1\uff0c\u5176\u5bb3\u901f\uff0c\u9806\u5247\u5176\u75c5\u9060\uff0c\u5176\u5bb3\u5fae\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u4e8c\u706b\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor asked: What is the harmony between prosperity and decline? Duke of Zhou replied: If not in its proper place, it's wrong; when in its proper place, it's right. Wrong leads to great changes, while right brings about subtlety. Emperor asked: What does being in its proper place mean? Duke of Zhou replied: When the Wood element is in its time, it corresponds with the Chen (June 5-20) and Xu (July 5-20) solar terms; when the Fire element is in its time, it corresponds with the Li (Summer solstice) and Xia (July 21-August 7) solar terms; when the Earth element is in its time, it corresponds with the Yi (Autumn equinox), Chou (September 23-October 7), and Ping (November 7-22) solar terms; when the Metal element is in its time, it corresponds with the Dao (Winter solstice); when the Water element is in its time, it corresponds with the Hai (December 22-January 6). What about it? Duke of Zhou replied: This is how heaven brings order to the cycle. The Heavenly Canon says, The Symbol of Heaven. What does the cycle of the Heavenly Canon mean? Duke of Zhou replied: It's the symbol of the Great Ultimate's harmony. Emperor asked: What about its nobility and base nature? Duke of Zhou replied: The Symbol of Heaven serves as the law, the cycle of time serves as the orders, and the Great Ultimate is noble. Emperor asked: What about being wrong within it? Duke of Zhou replied: Those who implement the law will become sick quickly and face danger; those who carry out orders will become sick gradually but surely. Those who are noble will become sick suddenly and die. Emperor asked: What about the changing nature of its proper place? Duke of Zhou replied: If a ruler is submissive to his ministers, it will be harmonious, and if a minister is submissive to his ruler, it will be orderly. When it's orderly, the sickness will be distant, and the harm will be minor; when it's chaotic, the sickness will be near, and the harm will come quickly.

I wish to hear about the way his steps are. Hui Biao said, What is meant by 'steps' is a cycle of sixty with oddities, so twenty-four cycles are enough to fill up a hundred markers and make a day. The Emperor said, How does the six qi correspond with the change of the five elements? Hui Biao replied, There are positions of beginning and end, and the qi has beginnings and middles; above and below they are different, seeking them is also different. The Emperor asked, How can one seek them? Hui Biao replied, Heavenly qi begins with A, earthly qi begins with B. A and B correspond, and they are called seasonal periods. Be careful of the time, and the qi can be matched to a date.</p> <p>7: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6b72\u516d\u6c23\u59cb\u7d42\u65e9\u664f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u660e\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u7532\u5b50\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u521d\u4e4b\u6c23\u5929\u6578\u59cb\u65bc\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u516b\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u534a\u3002\u4e8c\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u516b\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e03\u5341\u4e94\u523b\u3002\u4e09\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e03\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u516d\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u534a\u3002\u56db\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u516d\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e94\u5341\u523b\u3002\u4e94\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e94\u5341\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u534a\u3002\u516d\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u523b\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u521d\u516d\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u6578\u4e5f\u3002\u4e59\u4e11\u6b72\u521d\u4e4b\u6c23\u5929\u6578\u59cb\u65bc\u4e8c\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e00\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u534a\u3002\u4e8c\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u6c34\u4e0b\u767e\u523b\u3002\u4e09\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u516b\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u534a\u3002\u56db\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u516b\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e03\u5341\u4e94\u523b\u3002\u4e94\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e03\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u516d\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u534a\u3002\u516d\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u516d\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e94\u5341\u523b\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u516d\u4e8c\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u6578\u4e5f\u3002\u4e19\u5bc5\u6b72\uff0c\u521d\u4e4b\u6c23\u5929\u6578\u59cb\u65bc\u4e94\u5341\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u534a\u3002\u4e8c\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u523b\u3002\u4e09\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e8c\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e00\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u534a\u3002\u56db\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u6c34\u4e0b\u767e\u523b\u3002\u4e94\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u516b\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u534a\u3002\u516d\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u516b\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e03\u5341\u4e94\u523b\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u516d\u4e09\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u6578\u4e5f\u3002\u4e01\u536f\u6b72\uff0c\u521d\u4e4b\u6c23\u5929\u6578\u59cb\u65bc\u4e03\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u516d\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u534a\u3002\u4e8c\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u516d\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e94\u5341\u523b\u3002\u4e09\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e94\u5341\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u534a\u3002\u56db\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e09\u5341\u4e03\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u523b\u3002\u4e94\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e8c\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u4e00\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u534a\u3002\u516d\u4e4b\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u5341\u4e8c\u523b\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u6c34\u4e0b\u767e\u523b\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u516d\u56db\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u6578\u4e5f\u3002\u6b21\u620a\u8fb0\u6b72\uff0c\u521d\u4e4b\u6c23\u5fa9\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u5e38\u5982\u662f\u7121\u5df2\uff0c\u5468\u800c\u5fa9\u59cb\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6b72\u5019\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u65e5\u884c\u4e00\u5468\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u65e5\u884c\u518d\u5468\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e8c\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u65e5\u884c\u4e09\u5468\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e94\u5341\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u65e5\u884c\u56db\u5468\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u59cb\u65bc\u4e03\u5341\u516d\u523b\uff0c\u65e5\u884c\u4e94\u5468\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u5fa9\u59cb\u65bc\u4e00\u523b\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u4e00\u7d00\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u6545\u5bc5\u5348\u620c\u6b72\u6c23\u6703\u540c\uff0c\u536f\u672a\u4ea5\u6b72\u6c23\u6703\u540c\uff0c\u8fb0\u7533\u5b50\u6b72\u6c23\u6703\u540c\uff0c\u89bd\u5df3\u9149\u4e11\u6b72\u6c23\u6703\u540c\uff0c\u7d42\u800c\u5fa9\u59cb\u3002 Emperor: I want to hear about the six phases of life at sixty years old. Kuai Bo replied, This is truly a remarkable question.  In the Year of Yin and Metal (Astrological year), at sixty years old, the phase of Initial Qi starts from the moment of conception, lasting until 87.5 minutes. The second phase of Qi starts at 86.67 minutes and lasts until 75 minutes. The third phase of Qi starts at 75.34 minutes and lasts until 62.5 minutes. The fourth phase of Qi starts at 62.67 minutes and lasts until 50 minutes. The fifth phase of Qi starts at 50.14 minutes and lasts until 37.5 minutes. The sixth phase of Qi starts at 37.67 minutes and lasts until 25 minutes. This is referred to as the Initial Six, representing the number of celestial stems. In the Year of Water and Earth (Astrological year), the Initial Qi's duration starts from 26 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. The second phase of Qi starts at 12.67 minutes and lasts until the moment before conception. The third phase of Qi starts at the moment of conception and lasts until 87.5 minutes. The fourth phase of Qi starts at 86.67 minutes and lasts until 75 minutes. The fifth phase of Qi starts at 75.34 minutes and lasts until 62.5 minutes. The sixth phase of Qi starts at 62.67 minutes and lasts until 50 minutes. This is referred to as the Six Two, representing the number of celestial stems. In the Year of Wood and Earth (Astrological year), the Initial Qi's duration starts from 51 minutes and lasts until 37.5 minutes. The second phase of Qi starts at 37.67 minutes and lasts until 25 minutes. The third phase of Qi starts at 26 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. The fourth phase of Qi starts at 12.67 minutes and lasts until the moment before conception. The fifth phase of Qi starts at the moment of conception and lasts until 87.5 minutes. The sixth phase of Qi starts at 86.67 minutes and lasts until 75 minutes. This is referred to as the Six Three, representing the number of celestial stems. In the Year of Fire and Earth (Astrological year), the Initial Qi's duration starts from 76 minutes and lasts until 62.5 minutes. The second phase of Qi starts at 62.67 minutes and lasts until 50 minutes. The third phase of Qi starts at 50.14 minutes and lasts until 37.5 minutes. The fourth phase of Qi starts at 37.67 minutes and lasts until 25 minutes. The fifth phase of Qi starts at 26 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. The sixth phase of Qi starts at 12.67 minutes and lasts until the moment before conception. This is referred to as the Six Four, representing the number of celestial stems. In the Year of Earth and Water (Astrological year), the Initial Qi's duration restarts from the moment of conception, constantly repeating without end, returning to the beginning once again. Emperor: I want to hear about the seasonal phases. Kuai Bo replied, This is truly a remarkable question.  In one cycle, the phase of Qi starts at the moment of conception and lasts until 87.5 minutes. In two cycles, the phase of Qi starts at 26 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. In three cycles, the phase of Qi starts at 51 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. In four cycles, the phase of Qi starts at 76 minutes and lasts until</p> <p>8: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u7528\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8a00\u5929\u8005\u6c42\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u8a00\u5730\u8005\u6c42\u4e4b\u4f4d\uff0c\u8a00\u4eba\u8005\u6c42\u4e4b\u6c23\u4ea4\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u6c23\u4ea4\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e4b\u4f4d\uff0c\u6c23\u4ea4\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u4e4b\u5c45\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u6a1e\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\uff0c\u5929\u6a1e\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5730\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c23\u4ea4\u4e4b\u5206\uff0c\u4eba\u6c23\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u7531\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said, I wish to hear about its use.

The Emperor asked, What do you mean by 'breath and vitality?' Hui-B\u00f4 replied, The arrangement of above and below, the balance of breath and vitality is where people reside. Therefore, it is said that above the pivot (of Heaven), Heaven governs through its breath and vitality, below the pivot, Earth governs through its breath and vitality.

Huihui said: The initial stage refers to 30 degrees, with some oddity, and the central stage corresponds in terms of law. Emperor asked: What do you mean by initial and central? Huihui said: The initial phase refers to the earth's qi, and the central phase refers to the heaven's qi. Emperor asked: How does it ascend and descend? Huihui said: The ascending and descending of qi corresponds with the alternating use of heaven and earth. Emperor asked: How about its usage? Huihui said: After it has ascended, it descends, and when it descends, it is called heaven. After it has descended, it ascends, and when it ascends, it is called earth. When the qi of heaven descends, the qi flows to the earth, and when the qi of earth ascends, it leaps in the sky, so high and low call upon each other, and the ascending and descending cause change.</p> <p>10: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5bd2\u6fd5\u9058\u6e9d\uff0c\u71e5\u71b1\u76f8\u81e8\uff0c\u98a8\u706b\u76f8\u503c\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u805e\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u6709\u52dd\u5fa9\uff0c\u52dd\u5fa9\u4e4b\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u5fb7\u6709\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u7528\u6709\u8b8a\uff0c\u8b8a\u5247\u90aa\u6c23\u5c45\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u90aa\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u7269\u4e4b\u751f\u5f9e\u65bc\u5316\uff0c\u7269\u4e4b\u6975\u7531\u4e4e\u8b8a\uff0c\u8b8a\u5316\u4e4b\u76f8\u8584\uff0c\u6210\u6557\u4e4b\u6240\u7531\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u6c23\u6709\u5f80\u5fa9\uff0c\u7528\u6709\u9072\u901f\uff0c\u56db\u8005\u4e4b\u6709\u800c\u5316\u800c\u8b8a\uff0c\u98a8\u4e4b\u4f86\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9072\u901f\u5f80\u5fa9\uff0c\u98a8\u6240\u7531\u751f\uff0c\u800c\u5316\u800c\u8b8a\uff0c\u6545\u56e0\u76db\u8870\u4e4b\u8b8a\u8033\u3002\u6210\u6557\u501a\u4f0f\u904a\u4e4e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6210\u6557\u501a\u4f0f\u751f\u4e4e\u52d5\uff0c\u52d5\u800c\u4e0d\u5df2\uff0c\u5247\u8b8a\u4f5c\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u671f\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u751f\u4e0d\u5316\uff0c\u975c\u4e4b\u671f\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u751f\u5316\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u51fa\u5165\u5ee2\u5247\u795e\u6a5f\u5316\u6ec5\uff0c\u5347\u964d\u606f\u5247\u6c23\u7acb\u5b64\u5371\u3002\u6545\u975e\u51fa\u5165\uff0c\u5247\u7121\u4ee5\u751f\u9577\u58ef\u8001\u5df2\uff0c\u975e\u5347\u964d\uff0c\u5247\u7121\u4ee5\u751f\u9577\u5316\u6536\u85cf\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u5347\u964d\u51fa\u5165\uff0c\u7121\u5668\u4e0d\u6709\u3002\u6545\u5668\u8005\u751f\u5316\u4e4b\u5b87\uff0c\u5668\u6563\u5247\u5206\u4e4b\uff0c\u751f\u5316\u606f\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u7121\u4e0d\u51fa\u5165\uff0c\u7121\u6728\u5347\u964d\u3002\u5316\u6709\u5c0f\u5927\uff0c\u671f\u6709\u8fd1\u9060\uff0c\u56db\u8005\u4e4b\u6709\u800c\u8cb4\u5e38\u5b88\uff0c\u53cd\u5e38\u5247\u707d\u5bb3\u81f3\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u66f0\u7121\u5f62\u7121\u60a3\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6709\u4e0d\u751f\u4e0d\u5316\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u8207\u9053\u5408\u540c\uff0c\u60df\u771f\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 The Emperor said: Good. Cold and dampness pass through gullies, heat and drought are adjacent, wind and fire are mutual, do you know anything about it? Duke of Zhou said: The Qi has victory and defeat, the work of victory and defeat has virtue and transformation, has use and change, only then does evil Qi reside. What do you mean by evil? Duke of Zhou said: It is because things are born from transformation, extremes arise from change, the thinness of change is the cause of success or failure, therefore when Qi has coming and going, action has slowness and swiftness, all four have existence and transform and change, it is the wind. The Emperor said: Slowness and swiftness have coming and going, wind arises, and transforms and changes, so they change due to abundance and scarcity. Success and failure lean on the middle, what does this mean? Duke of Zhou said: Success and failure lean on movement, moving without stopping, then transformation occurs. The Emperor said: Is there a limit? Duke of Zhou said: Not being born or transformed is stillness, which is the limit. The Emperor said: Not being born transformed? Duke of Zhou said: If you discard upward and downward, then the spirit transforms and disappears; if you do not regulate breathing, then the Qi stands alone in peril. Therefore, not discarding upward and downward, there is no container without use. The vessel is the place of generating Qi, and when the vessel scatters, it divides, thus generating Qi. Therefore, there is no not having upward and downward, no wood does not have rising and falling. Transformation has small and great, periods have near and far, all four exist with a container, guarding the constant, reversing is a disaster. Therefore, it is said that formlessness has no harm, this is what is meant by it. The Emperor said: Good. Is there not being born or transformed? Duke of Zhou said: You have thoroughly asked about this matter. Merging with the way, only true people are able to do so.

Master Huan responded by bowing and kneeling again, replying: How brilliant the question is, it is the teachings of the true way. This matter treasured by the Emperor has been passed down by ancient sages, although I am not very quick-witted, I have heard about its intent. The Emperor said: I have heard from others that those who do not pass down this way are considered to have lost the path and carelessly spill heaven's treasure. I sincerely appreciate your teachings, but I am still insufficient to receive the highest way, yet my many sons lament that it was not completed, I hope that Master Huan can preserve it without exhaustion and flow without limit, so how should I proceed? Master Huan replied: Please allow me to explain this matter. The ancient classics say: The Way is knowing heaven's patterns above, understanding earth's principles below, and knowing human affairs in the middle, which can be long-lasting; this is what it means. The Emperor asked: What does that mean? Master Huan replied: It is the foundation and position. Positioned by heaven, it is heaven's patterns. Positioned by earth, it is earth's principles. Understanding human qi changes, it is human affairs, so too much leads to an earlier heavenly pattern, and not met with is a later heavenly pattern; this is called adjusting the seasons and people respond accordingly</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u904b\u4e4b\u5316\uff0c\u592a\u904e\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b72\u6728\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u98a8\u6c23\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u813e\u571f\u53d7\u90aa\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u98f1\u6cc4\u98df\u6e1b\uff0c\u9ad4\u91cd\u7169\u51a4\uff0c\u8178\u9cf4\u8179\u652f\u6eff\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u6b72\u661f\u3002\u751a\u5247\u5ffd\u5ffd\u5584\u6012\uff0c\u7729\u5192\u5dd4\u75be\uff0c\u5316\u6c23\u4e0d\u653f\uff0c\u751f\u6c23\u7368\u6cbb\uff0c\u96f2\u7269\u98db\u52d5\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u4e0d\u5be7\uff0c\u751a\u800c\u6416\u843d\uff0c\u53cd\u8107\u75db\u800c\u5410\u751a\uff0c\u885d\u967d\u7d55\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u592a\u767d\u661f\u3002\u6b72\u706b\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u708e\u6691\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u91d1\u80ba\u53d7\u90aa\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u7627\uff0c\u5c11\u6c23\u6b2c\u5598\uff0c\u8840\u6ea2\u8840\u6cc4\u6ce8\u4e0b\uff0c\u55cc\u71e5\u8033\u807e\uff0c\u4e2d\u71b1\u80a9\u80cc\u71b1\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u7192\u60d1\u661f\u3002\u751a\u5247\u80f8\u4e2d\u75db\u8107\u652f\u6eff\u8107\u75db\uff0c\u81ba\u80cc\u80a9\u80db\u9593\u75db\uff0c\u5169\u81c2\u5167\u75db\uff0c\u8eab\u71b1\u9aa8\u75db\uff0c\u800c\u70ba\u6d78\u6deb\u3002\u6536\u6c23\u4e0d\u884c\uff0c\u9577\u6c23\u7368\u660e\uff0c\u96e8\u6c34\u971c\u5bd2\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u8fb0\u661f\u3002\u4e0a\u81e8\u5c11\u9670\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u706b\u71d4\u712b\uff0c\u51b0\u6cc9\u6db8\uff0c\u7269\u7126\u69c1\uff0c\u75c5\u53cd\u8b6b\u5984\u72c2\u8d8a\uff0c\u6b2c\u5598\u606f\u9cf4\uff0c\u4e0b\u751a\u8840\u6ea2\u6cc4\u4e0d\u5df2\uff0c\u592a\u6df5\u7d55\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u7192\u60d1\u661f\u3002\u6b72\u571f\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u96e8\u6fd5\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u814e\u6c34\u53d7\u90aa\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u8179\u75db\uff0c\u6e05\u53a5\u610f\u4e0d\u6a02\uff0c\u9ad4\u91cd\u7169\u51a4\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u93ae\u661f\u3002\u751a\u5247\u808c\u8089\u840e\uff0c\u8db3\u75ff\u4e0d\u6536\uff0c\u884c\u5584\u7608\uff0c\u8173\u4e0b\u75db\uff0c\u98f2\u767c\u4e2d\u6eff\u98df\u6e1b\uff0c\u56db\u652f\u4e0d\u8209\u3002\u8b8a\u751f\u5f97\u4f4d\uff0c\u85cf\u6c23\u4f0f\uff0c\u5316\u6c23\u7368\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cc9\u6d8c\u6cb3\u884d\uff0c\u6db8\u6fa4\u751f\u9b5a\uff0c\u98a8\u96e8\u5927\u81f3\uff0c\u571f\u5d29\u6f70\uff0c\u9c57\u898b\u4e8e\u9678\uff0c\u75c5\u8179\u6eff\u6e8f\u6cc4\u8178\u9cf4\uff0c\u53cd\u4e0b\u751a\u800c\u592a\u8c3f\u7d55\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u6b72\u661f\u3002\u6b72\u91d1\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u71e5\u6c23\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u809d\u6728\u53d7\u90aa\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u5169\u8107\u4e0b\u5c11\u8179\u75db\uff0c\u76ee\u8d64\u75db\u7725\u760d\u8033\u7121\u6240\u805e\u3002\u8085\u6bba\u800c\u751a\uff0c\u5247\u9ad4\u91cd\u7169\u51a4\uff0c\u80f8\u75db\u5f15\u80cc\uff0c\u5169\u8107\u6eff\u4e14\u75db\u5f15\u5c11\u8179\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u592a\u767d\u661f\u3002\u751a\u5247\u5598\u6b2c\u9006\u6c23\uff0c\u80a9\u80cc\u75db\uff0c\u5c3b\u9670\u80a1\u819d\u9ac0\u8168\u4bd2\u8db3\u7686\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u7192\u60d1\u661f\u3002\u6536\u6c23\u5cfb\uff0c\u751f\u6c23\u4e0b\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u6582\uff0c\u84bc\u4e7e\u51cb\u9695\uff0c\u75c5\u53cd\u66b4\u75db\uff0c\u80e0\u8107\u4e0d\u53ef\u53cd\u5074\uff0c\u6b2c\u9006\u751a\u800c\u8840\u6ea2\uff0c\u592a\u885d\u7d55\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u592a\u767d\u661f\u3002\u6b72\u6c34\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c23\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u90aa\u5bb3\u5fc3\u706b\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u8eab\u71b1\u7169\u5fc3\u8e81\u60b8\uff0c\u9670\u53a5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e2d\u5bd2\uff0c\u8b6b\u5984\u5fc3\u75db\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c23\u65e9\u81f3\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u8fb0\u661f\u3002\u751a\u5247\u8179\u5927\u811b\u816b\uff0c\u5598\u6b2c\u5bd6\u6c57\u51fa\u618e\u98a8\uff0c\u5927\u96e8\u81f3\uff0c\u57c3\u9727\u6726\u9b31\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u93ae\u661f\u3002\u4e0a\u81e8\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u96e8\u51b0\u96ea\u971c\u4e0d\u6642\u964d\uff0c\u6fd5\u6c23\u8b8a\u7269\uff0c\u75c5\u53cd\u8179\u6eff\u8178\u9cf4\u6e8f\u6cc4\uff0c\u98df\u4e0d\u5316\uff0c\u6e34\u800c\u5984\u5192\uff0c\u795e\u9580\u7d55\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0a\u61c9\u7192\u60d1\u8fb0\u661f\u3002 Emporer: What is the result of the five elements' transformations? Prime Minister: The wood element is overly prevalent this year, resulting in wind and dryness. The earth and soil are being attacked by evil qi. People are suffering from diarrhea, vomiting, and reduced appetite, their bodies are heavy and burdened with aches, their intestines are bloated and painful, and they are experiencing symptoms that correspond to the seasonal stars. In severe cases, they suddenly become prone to anger, have dizziness, blurred vision, disorientation, and indigestion; the lungs are being attacked by evil qi. People suffer from fever, shortness of breath, excessive bleeding, nosebleeds, and back pain, corresponding to the stars of confusion. Their bodies ache, with bone-deep pain, and they develop sores. Recovery is difficult, as their lungs are unable to regulate Qi properly. There is rain and cold, and the meridians are not functioning properly. People suffer from fatigue, dizziness, indigestion, loss of appetite, deafness, back pain, shoulder pain, and painful joints in the elbows and hips. In severe cases, they may experience convulsions and vomiting blood; if the Yang Meridian is affected, death is inevitable and cannot be treated. This corresponds to the stars of confusion. The earth element has become overly prevalent this year, causing rain and dampness to spread. People are suffering from abdominal pain, and their minds are not at ease. Their bodies are heavy and burdened with aches. The Kidneys are being affected by evil qi. In severe cases, muscles weaken and legs become unstable, while the feet hurt and people suffer from bloating and excessive diarrhea. Bile accumulates in the intestines, causing pain and bleeding; in extreme cases, if the Chong Meridian is affected, death is inevitable and cannot be treated, corresponding to the seasonal stars. The metal element has become overly prevalent this year, causing dryness and heat to spread. People suffer from pain in their lower back and waist, as well as fever. They have red, painful eyes and ear problems, often accompanied by coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. If the evil qi affects the Yang Meridian, it leads to severe symptoms, such as convulsions, vomiting blood, and pain in the hip, genitals, knees, ankles, and toes. This corresponds to the stars of confusion. The water element has become overly prevalent this year, causing coldness and evil qi to spread. People suffer from fever, restlessness, insanity, and delusions, often accompanied by shortness of breath, excessive sweating, and indigestion.

I wish to hear about its time. Duke of Shao replied: How marvelous the question is. If wood does not prevail, in spring there will be the sound of birds and the laws of graceful transformation; then in autumn there will be the political cleansing of mist and dew. In spring there will be a victory over the cruel robbers, then in summer there will be the brightness and heat of the sun's scorching and burning. Its influence goes east; its treasure is the liver; its disease lies within the diaphragm and flanks, manifesting externally in the joints.</p> <p>If fire does not prevail, in summer there will be the brilliance and clarity of light, then in winter there will be the stern and frigid coldness of frost. In summer there will be a victory over the bitter cold, harsh freezing, and sometimes there will be heavy, dark rain. Its influence goes south; its treasure is the heart; its disease lies within the diaphragm, manifesting externally in the channels.</p> <p>If earth does not prevail, in the four seasons there will be clouds, richness, and fertility, then in spring there will be the political wind of drumming and dismantling. In autumn, there will be a stern, killing frost. Its influence goes everywhere; its treasure is the spleen; its disease lies within the diaphragm, manifesting externally in the heart, abdomen, and the four limbs' muscles.</p> <p>If metal does not prevail, in summer there will be the brightness and suffocating heat of the sun, then in winter there will be the stern, freezing coldness of hail, sleet, and snow. Its influence goes west; its treasure is the lungs; its disease lies within the diaphragm, manifesting externally in the shoulders, back, skin, and hair.</p> <p>If water does not prevail, in the four seasons there will be floods, richness, and clouds, then sometimes there will be a gentle breeze arising. In autumn, there will be gusts, scattering, pulling, and lifting. Its influence goes north; its treasure is the kidneys; its disease lies within the waist, spine, bones, and marrow, manifesting externally in the valleys and knee joints.</p> <p>The emperor said: Indeed, the five powers' orderliness is like a balance, high ones suppress it, low ones support it, responding to it, changing it, this is the principle of growth, decline, succession, and storage in nature, the norm of qi, losing it brings chaos to heaven and earth. Therefore, he said: The movement and stillness of heaven and earth, the spirits create their records. The ebb and flow of yin and yang, the clarity of cold and heat, this is what is called their signs.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u4e4b\u8a00\u4e94\u6c23\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u61c9\uff0c\u53ef\u8b02\u6089\u77e3\u3002\u592b\u6c23\u4e4b\u52d5\u4e82\uff0c\u89f8\u9047\u800c\u4f5c\uff0c\u767c\u7121\u5e38\u6703\uff0c\u5352\u7136\u707d\u5408\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u671f\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u6c23\u4e4b\u52d5\u8b8a\uff0c\u56fa\u4e0d\u5e38\u5728\uff0c\u800c\u5fb7\u5316\u653f\u4ee4\u707d\u8b8a\u4e0d\u540c\u5176\u5019\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6771\u65b9\u751f\u98a8\uff0c\u98a8\u751f\u6728\uff0c\u5176\u5fb7\u6577\u548c\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u751f\u69ae\uff0c\u5176\u653f\u8212\u555f\uff0c\u5176\u4ee4\u98a8\uff0c\u5176\u8b8a\u632f\u767c\uff0c\u5176\u707d\u6563\u843d\u3002\u5357\u65b9\u751f\u71b1\uff0c\u71b1\u751f\u706b\uff0c\u5176\u5fb7\u5f70\u986f\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u8543\u8302\uff0c\u5176\u653f\u660e\u66dc\uff0c\u5176\u4ee4\u71b1\uff0c\u5176\u8b8a\u92b7\u720d\uff0c\u5176\u707d\u71d4\u712b\u3002\u4e2d\u592e\u751f\u6fd5\uff0c\u6fd5\u751f\u571f\uff0c\u5176\u5fb7\u6ebd\u84b8\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u8c48\u5099\uff0c\u5176\u653f\u5b89\u975c\uff0c\u5176\u4ee4\u6fd5\uff0c\u5176\u8b8a\u9a5f\u6ce8\uff0c\u5176\u707d\u9716\u6f70\u3002\u897f\u65b9\u751f\u71e5\uff0c\u71e5\u751f\u91d1\uff0c\u5176\u5fb7\u6e05\u6f54\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u7dca\u6582\uff0c\u5176\u653f\u52c1\u5207\uff0c\u5176\u4ee4\u71e5\uff0c\u5176\u8b8a\u8085\u6bba\uff0c\u5176\u707d\u84bc\u9695\u3002\u5317\u65b9\u751f\u5bd2\uff0c\u5bd2\u751f\u6c34\uff0c\u5176\u5fb7\u6dd2\u6ec4\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u6e05\u8b10\uff0c\u5176\u653f\u51dd\u8085\uff0c\u5176\u4ee4\u5bd2\uff0c\u5176\u8b8a\u51d3\u51bd\uff0c\u5176\u707d\u51b0\u96ea\u971c\u96f9\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u5bdf\u5176\u52d5\u4e5f\uff0c\u6709\u5fb7\u6709\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u653f\u6709\u4ee4\uff0c\u6709\u8b8a\u6709\u707d\uff0c\u800c\u7269\u7531\u4e4b\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u61c9\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said: Master Zhou's words on the five changes of qi and the four correspondences are now fully understood. When qi is dynamic and chaotic, it happens when encountering a trigger, producing inconstant combinations that lead to sudden disasters. How can one foresee this? The Duke of Zhou replied: The dynamics and transformations of qi are not constant, but through the virtues of goodness, governance will prevent such changes from becoming as unpredictable as the weather. The Emperor asked: What do you mean by that? The Duke of Zhou replied: In the east, there is wind, which generates wood. Its virtue is broad and harmonious; its transformation produces fame; its governance is expansive and enlightening, issuing decrees that promote growth and development, with changes being vibrant and flourishing, and disasters being dispersed and dissipated. In the south, there is heat, which generates fire. Its virtue is clear and prominent; its transformation fosters weeds; its governance is bright and illuminating, issuing decrees that promote burning and combustion, with changes being destructive and devastating, and disasters being conflagrations and incineration. In the center, there is moisture, which generates soil. Its virtue is humid and steamy; its transformation produces moderation; its governance is peaceful and tranquil, issuing decrees that promote rain and inundation, with changes being sudden and saturating, and disasters being floods and inundations. In the west, there is aridity, which generates metal. Its virtue is clear and purified; its transformation is stringent and severe; its governance is forceful and decisive, issuing decrees that promote oppression and slaughter, with changes being ominous and threatening, and disasters being hailstones and air raids. In the north, there is cold, which generates water. Its virtue is frigid and vast; its transformation produces clarity; its governance is solid and restrained, issuing decrees that promote freezing and frostbite, with changes being hoary and icy, and disasters being blizzards and snowstorms. By observing these changes, there will be virtues and transformations, governance and decrees, changes and disasters.

Sudden movements are due to changes in vital energy; can such movements be avoided? Therefore, it is said that one should follow the constancy and not the suddenness.</p> <p>Duke Huan: By following the will of Heaven, there will be no unintended actions or failure to respond. Sudden movements result from changes in vital energy; how could they fail to respond? That is why it is said to follow constancy, not suddenness, and this is what is meant by it.</p> <p>Emperor: What does following constancy entail?</p> <p>Duke Huan: Each should act according to their own vital energy.</p> <p>Emperor: How are they to act in terms of speed and direction?</p> <p>Duke Huan: If the Way is followed for a long time, it will be conservative in scope and direction, which can be called foresight. If the Way is abandoned, it will come quickly and pass by, taking a roundabout route, which can be called catching up with what has been missed. Staying too long and circling may result in both disaster and virtue being mixed together.</p> <p>When constancy is close, the signs are small; when constancy is distant, they are large. The influence of great constancy is obvious, and its manifestations are evident. Small constancy, on the other hand, has its influences reduced, and these are what mix foresight with actions taken and missed opportunities with virtue. Virtue brings blessing, while excess brings punishment.</p> <p>Therefore, the oracle bone divination we see shows that when high, it is small, and when low, it is large; thus, if large, it evokes joy and anger, and if small, it leads to fortune or misfortune being distant. Seasons bring excessive change, and the stars move northward; when vital energy and stars meet, each follows their own Way. Thus, when seasons bring excessive change, people fear the loss of color in the stars and avoid them, but if they do not, the color will be lost.</p> <p>The oracle bone divination is unclear, and nobody knows its meaning, so who can say whether it is good or bad? When disasters follow constancy, there are times of flourishing and decline, offenses committed in inverse proportion to adherence to the Way, guarding with varying degrees of thoroughness, appearances that are good or evil, and relationships between those who prevailed and those who were defeated. The omens show signs of both good and bad fortune.</p> <p>Emperor: How do disasters follow constancy?</p> <p>Duke Huan: Just as each follows their own vital energy, so too do the disasters. Therefore, at times there will be times of abundance and decline, offenses committed in inverse proportion to adherence to the Way, guarding with varying degrees of thoroughness, appearances that are good or evil, and relationships between those who prevailed and those who were defeated. The omens show signs of both good and bad fortune.</p> <p>Emperor: What do the good and bad mean?</p> <p>Duke Huan: There is joy and anger, sorrow and grief, dryness and moisture; these are the constant signs of the oracle bone divination, and they must be meticulously studied.</p> <p>7: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5176\u5fb7\u5316\u653f\u4ee4\u4e4b\u52d5\u975c\u640d\u76ca\uff0c\u7686\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5fb7\u5316\u653f\u4ee4\u707d\u8b8a\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f8\u52a0\u4e5f\u3002\u52dd\u5fa9\u76db\u8870\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f8\u591a\u4e5f\u3002\u5f80\u4f86\u5c0f\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f8\u904e\u4e5f\u3002\u7528\u4e4b\u5347\u964d\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f8\u7121\u4e5f\u3002\u5404\u5f9e\u5176\u52d5\u800c\u5fa9\u4e4b\u8033\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u75c5\u751f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5fb7\u5316\u8005\u6c23\u4e4b\u7965\uff0c\u653f\u4ee4\u8005\u6c23\u4e4b\u7ae0\uff0c\u8b8a\u6613\u8005\u5fa9\u4e4b\u7d00\uff0c\u707d\u771a\u8005\u50b7\u4e4b\u59cb\uff0c\u6c23\u76f8\u52dd\u8005\u548c\uff0c\u4e0d\u76f8\u52dd\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u91cd\u611f\u65bc\u90aa\uff0c\u5247\u751a\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u7cbe\u5149\u4e4b\u8ad6\uff0c\u5927\u8056\u4e4b\u696d\uff0c\u5ba3\u660e\u5927\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u65bc\u7121\u7aae\uff0c\u7a76\u65bc\u7121\u6975\u4e5f\u3002\u4f59\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u5584\u8a00\u5929\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u61c9\u65bc\u4eba\uff0c\u5584\u8a00\u53e4\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u9a57\u65bc\u4eca\uff0c\u5584\u8a00\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u5f70\u65bc\u7269\uff0c\u5584\u8a00\u61c9\u8005\uff0c\u540c\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u5316\uff0c\u5584\u8a00\u5316\u8a00\u8b8a\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u795e\u660e\u4e4b\u7406\u3002\u975e\u592b\u5b50\uff0c\u5b70\u80fd\u8a00\u81f3\u9053\u6b5f\u3002\u8ffa\u64c7\u826f\u5146\u800c\u85cf\u4e4b\u9748\u5ba4\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e6\u8b80\u4e4b\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u6c23\u4ea4\u8b8a\uff0c\u975e\u9f4a\u6212\u4e0d\u6562\u767c\uff0c\u614e\u50b3\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked: What is the effect of the changing and unchanging aspects of governance on benefit or harm? Duke of Zhou replied: The virtue-based governance and laws change with the times, and cannot be added together. The rise and decline, the small and great, and the coming and going cannot be compared. Their application causes them to wax and wane, and cannot be combined. Each should follow its movement and then stop. The Emperor asked: What are the symptoms of this disease? Duke of Zhou replied: The virtue is the auspicious energy, while the governance laws are the appropriate energy; the changes and transformations are the record-keeping, calamities are the initial injury, the energy that prevails brings harmony, while the lack thereof brings sickness. It heavily affects evil spirits. The Emperor said: Good. This is the discussion of the profound light and great sagely work, clarifying the Great Way, extending to inexhaustible wonders, and reaching the ultimate extremes. I have heard it said that whoever speaks of the highest way must respond in humans, must verify the ancients, must manifest the energy in things, must harmonize with the transformation of heaven and earth, and must interpret transformations into the principles of spirits. Who besides Confucius could speak of the ultimate way? Now I have chosen a good omen and hidden it in the spiritual room, and every day read it aloud. The command says: energy exchange and transformation. This is not to be revealed carelessly or hastily, but to be cautious when transmitting it</p>"},{"location":"6_huangdi-neijing_yin-yang-li-he-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u9670\u967d\u96e2\u5408\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u5929\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u5730\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u65e5\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u6708\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u6708\u4e09\u767e\u516d\u5341\u65e5\u6210\u4e00\u6b72\uff0c\u4eba\u4ea6\u61c9\u4e4b\u3002\u4eca\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\uff0c\u4e0d\u61c9\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u5341\uff0c\u63a8\u4e4b\u53ef\u767e\uff0c\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u5343\uff0c\u63a8\u4e4b\u53ef\u842c\uff0c\u842c\u4e4b\u5927\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u6578\uff0c\u7136\u5176\u8981\u4e00\u4e5f\u3002\u5929\u8986\u5730\u8f09\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u65b9\u751f\uff0c\u672a\u51fa\u5730\u8005\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u9670\u8655\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\uff1b\u5247\u51fa\u5730\u8005\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\u3002\u967d\u4e88\u4e4b\u6b63\uff0c\u9670\u70ba\u4e4b\u4e3b\u3002\u6545\u751f\u56e0\u6625\uff0c\u9577\u56e0\u590f\uff0c\u6536\u56e0\u79cb\uff0c\u85cf\u56e0\u51ac\uff0c\u5931\u5e38\u5247\u5929\u5730\u56db\u585e\u3002\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u4ea6\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u6578\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked: I have heard that heaven is yang, earth is yin, the sun is yang and the moon is yin. A month has 360 days, completing a year, and humans should also follow this. Now there are three yins and three yangs not following the yin and yang, what is the reason for this? The Grand Officer replied: Yin and Yang can be counted to ten, extended to a hundred, counted to a thousand, and extended to ten thousand, but its root is one. Heaven covers the earth, and myriad things are born; those not yet out of the earth have the command of yin and the name of the hidden yin within the yin; once out of the earth, they have the command of the yin within the yang. Yang gives birth to it, and yin governs it. Therefore, life arises in spring, grows in summer, harvests in autumn, stores in winter, and losing this order leads to chaos in heaven and earth. The changes of yin and yang are also something that can be counted in humans.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\u4e4b\u96e2\u5408\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8056\u4eba\u5357\u9762\u800c\u7acb\uff0c\u524d\u66f0\u5ee3\u660e\uff0c\u5f8c\u66f0\u592a\u885d\uff0c\u592a\u885d\u4e4b\u5730\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u6839\u8d77\u65bc\u81f3\u9670\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u547d\u9580\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\u3002\u4e2d\u8eab\u800c\u4e0a\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5ee3\u660e\uff0c\u5ee3\u660e\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u6839\u8d77\u65bc\u53b2\u514c\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u967d\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u8868\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u6839\u8d77\u65bc\u7ac5\u9670\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5c11\u967d\u3002\u662f\u6545\u4e09\u967d\u4e4b\u96e2\u5408\u4e5f\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u70ba\u958b\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u70ba\u95d4\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u70ba\u6a1e\u3002\u4e09\u7d93\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u76f8\u5931\u4e5f\uff0c\u640f\u800c\u52ff\u6d6e\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u4e00\u967d\u3002 The Emperor said: I wish to hear about the separation and combination of the three Yin and three Yang. Kuai Bo said: A sage stands facing south; in front it is Broad Brightness, behind it is Great Excess, the land of Great Excess is called Lesser Yin, the area above Lesser Yin is called Great Yang, the root of Great Yang arises from the Extreme Yin, binds at the Command Gate, and is called the Yang within Yin. Rising inwardly and above it is called Broad Brightness; below Broad Brightness it is called Greater Yin, the front of Greater Yin is called Yang Bright, the root of Yang Bright arises from severe cleaving and is called the Yang within Yin. The surface of Excess Yin is called Lesser Yang, the root of Lesser Yang arises from the Orifice Yin and is called the Yang within Lesser Yang. Therefore, the separation and combination of the three Yangs are as follows: Great Yang opens, Yang Bright closes, and Lesser Yang serves as the pivot.

Guo Bo said: The outside is Yang and the inside is Yin, so the center is Yin, its surge is below, named as Taiyin, the root of Taiyin originates from Xuanbi, named as Yinxuantaiyin. The offspring of Taiyin, named as Shaoyin, Shaoyin's root originates from Shuopan, named as Yinxuanshaoyin. Shaoyin's front is named as Jiyin, Jiyin's root originates from Dadun, the termination of Yin and the beginning of Yang, named as Yin's termination of Yin. Therefore, the separation and combination of the Three Yin, Taiyin opens, Jiyin closes, Shaoyin is the pivot. The three classics must not be lost. Struggling yet not sinking, named as one Yin.

The Records of the Changes:</p> <p>The Record of Origin (\u53d1\u751f\u4e4b\u7eaa) describes J\u01d0 (\u542f), the beginning of heaven and earth, where yin and yang are balanced and the political order is harmonious. There is a peaceful flow of qi energy in all things, and the virtues are manifested. Yang Qi ascends, while yin Qi descends, creating a balance between the two energies that govern the universe. The political order is firm but not rigid, and there is no confusion or disorder. The land flourishes, and all creatures thrive in harmony. The colors of the fruits are bright and vibrant, their flavors pure and sweet, and the seasons are mild and pleasant. The Record of the Classics (\u8d6b\u66e6\u4e4b\u7eaa) describes Y\u00e1ngp\u00edng (\u8363\u8302), a period when yin energy is concentrated within and Yang Qi shines externally. There is a balance between the two energies, but with a greater emphasis on Yang energy. The political order is strong and just, but not oppressive, and the qi energy of all creatures flows smoothly. The colors of fruits are rich and varied, their flavors spicy and salty, and the seasons are hot and sunny. The Record of Changes (\u6566\u961c\u4e4b\u7eaa) describes H\u00f2ud\u00ecng (\u539a\u5fb7), an era characterized by a deep understanding of yin and yang energies. There is a balance between the two energies, but with more emphasis on the virtues and moral values that govern society. The political order is just and fair, and there is no confusion or disorder. All creatures thrive in harmony, and their colors are muted and subdued, with flavors that are mild and bland. The Record of Concealment (\u6d41\u884d\u4e4b\u7eaa) describes Sh\u011bn (\u5c01\u85cf), an era when yin energy is dominant and the political order is more oppressive and rigid. There is a greater emphasis on controlling people's actions and restricting their freedom. All creatures are subdued, and their colors are dark and somber, with flavors that are bitter or salty. The seasons are cold and harsh, and the qi energy of all creatures is stagnant and unhealthy.</p> <p>The above translations are from the I Ching, which is a classic Chinese text that dates back to around 1000 BCE.

The Duke of Zhou replied: This is due to the different qualities of the energy of yin and yang. In the south and east, it is yang energy, which causes its essence to descend below, resulting in heat on the right and warmth on the left. In the west and north, it is yin energy, which causes its essence to pay homage above, resulting in cold on the left and coolness on the right. Therefore, there are high and low energies, with warmth and coolness. When something adapts to cold and heat, the body's cavities expand, and when there is warmth and heat, it produces boils; once the cavities have expanded and the boils have formed, this is the natural opening and closing of the body's pores, a manifestation of too little energy. The Emperor asked: How does this relate to life and death? The Duke of Zhou replied: The essence of yin causes people to live longer, and the descending essence of yang causes people to die earlier. The Emperor asked: Good. What should be done to treat the disease? The Duke of Zhou said: The energy of the west is dispersed and cold, while the energy of the south is concentrated and warm. This is what is meant by treating similar diseases differently. Therefore, for energy that is cold and energy that is warm, treat with coolness and heat respectively, and regulate water astringency. For energy that is warm and energy that is hot, strengthen the interior guard. If you can harmonize their energies, it will be beneficial, but if you misjudge this, the opposite will occur.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u4e00\u5dde\u4e4b\u6c23\u751f\u5316\u58fd\u592d\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u9ad8\u4e0b\u4e4b\u7406\u5730\u52e2\u4f7f\u7136\u4e5f\u3002\u5d07\u9ad8\u5247\u9670\u6c23\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c61\u4e0b\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u967d\u52dd\u8005\u5148\u5929\uff0c\u9670\u52dd\u8005\u5f8c\u5929\uff0c\u6b64\u5730\u7406\u4e4b\u5e38\uff0c\u751f\u5316\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u6709\u58fd\u592d\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u9ad8\u8005\u5176\u6c23\u58fd\uff0c\u4e0b\u8005\u5176\u6c23\u592d\uff0c\u5730\u4e4b\u5c0f\u5927\u7570\u4e5f\uff0c\u5c0f\u8005\u5c0f\u7570\uff0c\u5927\u8005\u5927\u7570\u3002\u6545\u6cbb\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u660e\u5929\u9053\u5730\u7406\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u66f4\u52dd\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u5148\u5f8c\uff0c\u4eba\u4e4b\u58fd\u592d\uff0c\u751f\u5316\u4e4b\u671f\uff0c\u4e43\u53ef\u4ee5\u77e5\u4eba\u4e4b\u5f62\u6c23\u77e3\u3002 Emperor: What causes the longevity and death to vary among people in a single province?  Duke of Zhou: It is due to the differences in high and low positions. When one is esteemed, yin qi nourishes and governs them, while when one is despised, yang qi nourishes and governs them. The one who excels first in nature is yang, and the one who follows is yin; this is the constant way of land and growth. Emperor: Is there longevity and death? Duke of Zhou: Those who are esteemed have their qi leading to longevity, while those who are despised have their qi leading to death. The differences in small and great are due to the land, with small ones having smaller differences and large ones having greater differences. Therefore, when treating illnesses, one must understand heaven's way, the principles of yin and yang, the order of qi, the periods of life and death, and the growth cycles; only then can one discern a person's form and qi.</p> <p>6: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5176\u6b72\u6709\u4e0d\u75c5\uff0c\u800c\u85cf\u6c23\u4e0d\u61c9\u4e0d\u7528\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u6c23\u5236\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c23\u6709\u6240\u5f9e\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5c11\u967d\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u706b\u6c23\u4e0b\u81e8\uff0c\u80ba\u6c23\u4e0a\u5f9e\uff0c\u767d\u8d77\u91d1\u7528\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u771a\uff0c\u706b\u898b\u71d4\u712b\uff0c\u9769\u91d1\u4e14\u8017\uff0c\u5927\u6691\u4ee5\u884c\uff0c\u6b2c\u568f\u9f3d\u8842\u9f3b\u7a92\uff0c\u66f0\u760d\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u80d5\u816b\u3002\u98a8\u884c\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u5875\u6c99\u98db\u63da\uff0c\u5fc3\u75db\u80c3\u8118\u75db\uff0c\u53a5\u9006\u9b32\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u66b4\u901f\u3002\u967d\u660e\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u71e5\u6c23\u4e0b\u81e8\uff0c\u809d\u6c23\u4e0a\u5f9e\uff0c\u84bc\u8d77\u6728\u7528\u800c\u7acb\uff0c\u571f\u8ffa\u771a\uff0c\u6dd2\u6ec4\u6578\u81f3\uff0c\u6728\u4f10\u8349\u840e\uff0c\u8107\u75db\u76ee\u8d64\uff0c\u6389\u632f\u9f13\u6144\uff0c\u7b4b\u75ff\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e45\u7acb\u3002\u66b4\u71b1\u81f3\uff0c\u571f\u8ffa\u6691\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u9b31\u767c\u75db\uff0c\u5c0f\u4fbf\u8b8a\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u5982\u7627\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u5fc3\u75db\uff0c\u706b\u884c\u4e8e\u7a3f\uff0c\u6d41\u6c34\u4e0d\u51b0\uff0c\u87c4\u87f2\u8ffa\u898b\u3002\u592a\u967d\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c23\u4e0b\u81e8\uff0c\u5fc3\u6c23\u4e0a\u5f9e\uff0c\u800c\u706b\u4e14\u660e\uff0c\u4e39\u8d77\u91d1\u8ffa\u771a\uff0c\u5bd2\u6e05\u6642\u8209\uff0c\u52dd\u5247\u6c34\u51b0\uff0c\u706b\u6c23\u9ad8\u660e\uff0c\u5fc3\u71b1\u7169\u55cc\u4e7e\uff0c\u5584\u6e34\u9f3d\u568f\uff0c\u559c\u60b2\u6578\u6b20\uff0c\u71b1\u6c23\u5984\u884c\uff0c\u5bd2\u8ffa\u5fa9\uff0c\u971c\u4e0d\u6642\u964d\uff0c\u5584\u5fd8\u751a\u5247\u5fc3\u75db\u3002\u571f\u8ffa\u6f64\uff0c\u6c34\u8c50\u884d\uff0c\u5bd2\u5ba2\u81f3\uff0c\u6c88\u9670\u5316\u6fd5\uff0c\u6c23\u8b8a\u7269\u6c34\u98f2\u5167\u84c4\uff0c\u4e2d\u6eff\u4e0d\u98df\uff0c\u76ae\ud853\ude37\u8089\u82db\uff0c\u7b4b\u8108\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u80d5\u816b\u8eab\u5f8c\u7670\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u98a8\u6c23\u4e0b\u81e8\uff0c\u813e\u6c23\u4e0a\u5f9e\uff0c\u800c\u571f\u4e14\u9686\uff0c\u9ec3\u8d77\u6c34\u8ffa\u771a\uff0c\u571f\u7528\u9769\uff0c\u9ad4\u91cd\u808c\u8089\u840e\uff0c\u98df\u6e1b\u53e3\u723d\uff0c\u98a8\u884c\u592a\u865b\uff0c\u96f2\u7269\u6416\u52d5\uff0c\u76ee\u8f49\u8033\u9cf4\u3002\u706b\u7e31\u5176\u66b4\uff0c\u5730\u8ffa\u6691\uff0c\u5927\u71b1\u6d88\u720d\uff0c\u8d64\u6c83\u4e0b\uff0c\u87c4\u87f2\u6578\u898b\uff0c\u6d41\u6c34\u4e0d\u51b0\uff0c\u5176\u767c\u6a5f\u901f\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u71b1\u6c23\u4e0b\u81e8\uff0c\u80ba\u6c23\u4e0a\u5f9e\uff0c\u767d\u8d77\u91d1\u7528\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u771a\uff0c\u5598\u5614\u5bd2\u71b1\u568f\u9f3d\u8842\u9f3b\u7a92\uff0c\u5927\u6691\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u7621\u760d\u71d4\u707c\uff0c\u91d1\u720d\u77f3\u6d41\u3002\u5730\u8ffa\u71e5\u6e05\uff0c\u6dd2\u6ec4\u6578\u81f3\uff0c\u8107\u75db\u5584\u592a\u606f\uff0c\u8085\u6bba\u884c\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u8b8a\u3002\u592a\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u6fd5\u6c23\u4e0b\u81e8\uff0c\u814e\u6c23\u4e0a\u5f9e\uff0c\u9ed1\u8d77\u6c34\u8b8a\uff0c\u57c3\u5192\u96f2\u96e8\uff0c\u80f8\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u9670\u75ff\u6c23\u5927\u8870\u800c\u4e0d\u8d77\u4e0d\u7528\u3002\u7576\u5176\u6642\u53cd\u8170\u813d\u75db\uff0c\u52d5\u8f49\u4e0d\u4fbf\u4e5f\u3002\u53a5\u9006\uff0c\u5730\u8ffa\u85cf\u9670\uff0c\u5927\u5bd2\u4e14\u81f3\uff0c\u87c4\u87f2\u65e9\u9644\uff0c\u5fc3\u4e0b\u5426\u75db\uff0c\u5730\u88c2\u51b0\u5805\uff0c\u5c11\u8179\u75db\u6642\u5bb3\u65bc\u98df\uff0c\u4e58\u91d1\u5247\u6b62\u6c34\u589e\uff0c\u5473\u8ffa\u9e79\uff0c\u884c\u6c34\u6e1b\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor said: Good. At a certain age, one may not fall ill and yet the qi does not flow properly. What is the reason for this? The Duke of Zhou said: The celestial qi governs it, and there is indeed a source of qi. Emperor said: I would like to hear more about this. The Duke of Zhou said: The ShaoYang department controls heavenly qi; fire qi is below and lung qi is above, while gold has its uses, trees and grasses flourish, fire can burn and consume, great heat passes, sore throat, cough, snivel nose blocked, saying it's a boil, cold and hot swell and become bloated. The Yang Ming department controls heaven; parched qi is below, liver qi flows above, while blue uses wood and stands firm, earth sees grasses flourish, drought lasts for a long time, wood cuts trees and grasses wilt, side pain, red eyes, trembling, and rapid heartbeat, unable to stand for long. Extreme heat comes, earth sees great heat, Yang qi surges with pain, urination changes, cold and heat like plague, in extreme cases, there is side pain, fire acts on silk, water does not freeze, insects appear. The TaiYang department controls cold qi; heart qi flows above, while fire indeed shines brightly, gold accumulates below, clear times raise water, excellent cases cause ice, fire qi and heart heat, thirst, cough, sore throat, lacking joy, agitated qi acts chaotically, cold then comes, frost does not come at the right time, causing forgetfulness in extreme cases, heart pain. Earth sees moistness, water is abundant, cold clientizes and humidifies, qi changes water and fluid inside the body accumulates, unable to eat and skin and muscle become stiff, qi and vessels do not circulate well, in extreme cases, swelling of the lower back and boils appear. The JueYin department controls wind qi; spleen qi is below, while earth indeed flourishes, yellow uses water below, earth nourishes muscles, appetite decreases, saliva dries up, wind acts too much, objects shake, eyes turn and ears ring. Fire goes wild, earth sees heat, great heat destroys, red genitals appear, insects multiply, water does not freeze, the mechanism is fast. The ShaoYin department controls fire qi; lung qi is below, while gold has its uses, trees and grasses flourish, cough, cold and hot with sore throat, snivel nose blocked, saying it's a boil, great heat passes, skin of the back becomes red. Earth sees dryness, drought lasts for a long time, side pain is easily alleviated by deep breathing, while grasses change. The JueYang department controls water qi; kidney qi is below, while parched uses earth, black accumulates below, water changes into ice, rain clouds gather, there is no benefit inside the chest, yin weakens and wastes away, not rising or being used. When it's time, lower back and hip pain occurs, movement is difficult also. The TaiYin department controls dampness qi; bladder qi is below, while black accumulates below, water changes into ice, rain clouds gather, there is no benefit inside the chest, yin weakens and wastes away, not rising or being used.

What principle governs this? </p> <p>Duke of Zhou replied: The six Qi and five phases have the power to overcome each other. When something is predominant, it strengthens; when something is different, it weakens. This is the principle of Heaven and Earth, the constant of creation. Therefore, the Yin Palace governs Heaven in stillness, insects at rest, arthropods thriving, crustaceans not developing, in water, insects thrive, crustaceans consume, arthropods do not reproduce. The Lesser Yin governs Heaven in stillness, arthropods develop, insects do not take form, in water, arthropods thrive, crustaceans do not reproduce. The Lesser Yang governs Heaven in motion, insects are at rest, crustaceans develop, arthropods do not take form, in water, insects thrive, arthropods consume, arthropods do not reproduce. The Yang Ming governs Heaven in motion, crustaceans are at rest, arthropods reproduce, crustaceans do not develop, in water, crustaceans reproduce, arthropods consume, arthropods do not reproduce. The Greater Yang governs Heaven in motion, fish are at rest, insects reproduce, fish do not develop. The myriad phenomena that do not succeed are indeed rare. Therefore, there is a governing principle for the Qi, and certain seasons produce certain manifestations. The Heavenly Qi prevails over the Earthly Qi, and the Earthly Qi prevails over the Heavenly Qi. Heaven determines color, and Earth determines form. The five phases rise and fall according to their appropriate Qi. Each has its own governing principle, victory, production, and success. Thus, not knowing the influence of years and the difference between similar and dissimilar Qi is insufficient to explain the creation of life. This is what is meant by the mystery of the central root. The central root exists externally as well, giving rise to the distinction in creation, with five kinds of Qi, flavors, colors, phases, and manifestations according to their suitability. </p> <p>Emperor: What do you mean? </p> <p>Duke of Zhou replied: The central root is the spirit, and it is called the divine machine. If the spirit departs, then the vital force inherent in the external world ceases to function. When the Qi stops, life ends. Therefore, each has its own governing principle, victory, production, and success. Thus, not knowing the influence of years and the difference between similar and dissimilar Qi is insufficient to explain the creation of life.

However, the resources of the Five Flavors affect the generation and completion of life, and whether they are abundant or sparse, and their beginning and end are different, why is this so? Duke of Shao replied: The Earth governs it, and it is not that the Heavens do not produce it, nor does the Earth prolong it. The Emperor said: I wish to hear its method. Duke of Shao said: Coldness and warmth, dryness and moistness, differ in their transformations. Therefore, Yin and Yang are present at springs, and the poison does not arise. Their flavors are bitter, and they treat acrid and bitter, their grains are red and yellow. Yin and Yang are present at springs, the damp poison does not arise, their flavors are sour, their Qi is moist, and they treat bitter and acrid, sweet, their grains are black and white. The Great Yang is present at springs, the heat poison does not arise, their flavor is bitter, and they treat bland and salty, their grains are green and yellow. The Lesser Yin is present at springs, the cold poison does not arise, their flavor is bitter, and they treat acrid and bitter, sweet, their grains are white and black. The Great Yin is present at springs, the arid poison does not arise, their flavor is salty, their Qi is hot, and they treat sweet and salty, their tools are green and yellow. When the transformations are pure, salt is preserved, and when the Qi is distinct, it becomes bitter and treats all.</p> <p>9: \u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8005\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8005\u9006\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6240\u5728\u5bd2\u71b1\u76db\u8870\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u53d6\u4e0b\u53d6\uff0c\u5167\u53d6\u5916\u53d6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c42\u5176\u904e\u3002\u80fd\u6bd2\u8005\u4ee5\u539a\u85e5\uff0c\u4e0d\u52dd\u6bd2\u8005\u4ee5\u8584\u85e5\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u6c23\u53cd\u8005\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u4e0a\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u4e2d\uff0c\u508d\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u6cbb\u71b1\u4ee5\u5bd2\uff0c\u6eab\u800c\u884c\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u5bd2\u4ee5\u71b1\uff0c\u6dbc\u800c\u884c\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u6eab\u4ee5\u6e05\uff0c\u51b7\u800c\u884c\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u6e05\u4ee5\u6eab\uff0c\u71b1\u800c\u884c\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u6d88\u4e4b\u524a\u4e4b\uff0c\u5410\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4e4b\uff0c\u88dc\u4e4b\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e45\u65b0\u540c\u6cd5\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u5728\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u5be6\u4e0d\u5805\uff0c\u4e14\u805a\u4e14\u6563\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u7121\u7a4d\u8005\u6c42\u5176\u85cf\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u85e5\u4ee5\u88aa\u4e4b\uff0c\u98df\u4ee5\u96a8\u4e4b\uff0c\u884c\u6c34\u6f2c\u4e4b\uff0c\u548c\u5176\u4e2d\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u7562\u5df2\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u6bd2\u7121\u6bd2\uff0c\u670d\u6709\u7d04\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u75c5\u6709\u4e45\u65b0\uff0c\u65b9\u6709\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u6709\u6bd2\u7121\u6bd2\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9c\u5e38\u5236\u77e3\u3002\u5927\u6bd2\u6cbb\u75c5\uff0c\u5341\u53bb\u5176\u516d\uff0c\u5e38\u6bd2\u6cbb\u75c5\uff0c\u5341\u53bb\u5176\u4e03\uff0c\u5c0f\u6bd2\u6cbb\u75c5\uff0c\u5341\u53bb\u5176\u516b\uff0c\u7121\u6bd2\u6cbb\u75c5\uff0c\u5341\u53bb\u5176\u4e5d\u3002\u7a40\u8089\u679c\u83dc\uff0c\u98df\u990a\u76e1\u4e4b\uff0c\u7121\u4f7f\u904e\u4e4b\uff0c\u50b7\u5176\u6b63\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u76e1\uff0c\u884c\u5fa9\u5982\u6cd5\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u6b72\u6c23\uff0c\u7121\u4f10\u5929\u548c\uff0c\u7121\u76db\u76db\uff0c\u7121\u865b\u865b\uff0c\u800c\u907a\u4eba\u5929\u6b83\uff0c\u7121\u81f4\u90aa\uff0c\u7121\u5931\u6b63\uff0c\u7d55\u4eba\u9577\u547d\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u4e45\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u6c23\u5f9e\u4e0d\u5eb7\uff0c\u75c5\u53bb\u800c\u7620\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u662d\u4e4e\u54c9\u8056\u4eba\u4e4b\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee3\uff0c\u6642\u4e0d\u53ef\u9055\u3002\u592b\u7d93\u7d61\u4ee5\u901a\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u4ee5\u5f9e\uff0c\u5fa9\u5176\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8207\u773e\u9f4a\u540c\uff0c\u990a\u4e4b\u548c\u4e4b\uff0c\u975c\u4ee5\u5f85\u6642\uff0c\u8b39\u5b88\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u7121\u4f7f\u50be\u79fb\uff0c\u5176\u5f62\u8ffa\u5f70\uff0c\u751f\u6c23\u4ee5\u9577\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u8056\u738b\u3002\u6545\u5927\u8981\u66f0\uff1a\u7121\u4ee3\u5316\uff0c\u7121\u9055\u6642\uff0c\u5fc5\u990a\u5fc5\u548c\uff0c\u5f85\u5176\u4f86\u5fa9\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 It is said: One who supplements above and below follows it, one who regulates above and below inverts it, using the location of cold and heat, deficiency and excess to adjust it. Therefore it is said: Taking from above and taking from below, seeking its excess. One who has poison uses thick medicine, one who is not overcome by poison uses thin medicine; this is what it means. Reversing Qi, the disease is in the upper part, take from the lower part; the disease is in the lower part, take from the upper part; the disease is in the middle, surround it from the outside. Treating heat with cold, let it circulate; treating cold with heat, cool it; treating warmth with clarity, let it circulate; treating clarity with warmth, let it circulate. Therefore eliminate it and weaken it, cause it to be expelled and eliminated, supplement it and fill it, this lasts for a long time. The Emperor said: The disease is in the middle but it is not firm nor solid, and it aggregates and disperses; what about that? The Duke of Shao said: Truly, you have asked a thorough question. Do not accumulate it; if empty, supplement it; if vacant, fill it with medicine; follow its changes, so as to bring the matter to an end. The Emperor said: There is poison and no poison, are there rules for taking medicine? The Duke of Shao said: Because diseases have varying degrees of acuteness and chronicity, and because they are poisonous or not poisonous, it is necessary to be cautious. Treating a great poison, subtract six; treating a constant poison, subtract seven; treating a small poison, subtract eight; treating a non-poisonous disease, subtract nine. Grains, meats, fruits and vegetables; nourish them completely so as not to harm them. Not fully nourishing leads to damage of the proper; repeating this results in damage at the seasonal level, without disturbing heaven's harmony, without abundance and scarcity, without being full or empty, and thus leaving behind a heritage of human calamity, without giving rise to perversity, without harming the natural course, severing human life and shortening their longevity. Therefore it is said: There are no substitutes for nature and there is no transgression of time. Nourishing and harmonizing must be present; awaiting the return of its coming and going, this is what it means. The Emperor said: Good.</p>"},{"location":"71_huangdi-neijing_liu-yuan-zheng-ji-da-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u516d\u5143\u6b63\u7d00\u5927\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u516d\u5316\u516d\u8b8a\uff0c\u52dd\u5fa9\u6deb\u6cbb\uff0c\u7518\u82e6\u8f9b\u9e79\u9178\u6de1\u5148\u5f8c\uff0c\u4f59\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\u592b\u4e94\u904b\u4e4b\u5316\uff0c\u6216\u5f9e\u4e94\u6c23\uff0c\u6216\u9006\u4e94\u6c23\uff0c\u6216\u5f9e\u5929\u6c23\u800c\u9006\u5730\u6c23\uff0c\u6216\u5f9e\u5730\u6c23\u800c\u9006\u5929\u6c23\uff0c\u6216\u76f8\u5f97\uff0c\u6216\u4e0d\u76f8\u5f97\uff0c\u4f59\u672a\u80fd\u660e\u5176\u4e8b\u3002\u6b32\u901a\u5929\u4e4b\u7d00\uff0c\u5f9e\u5730\u4e4b\u7406\uff0c\u548c\u5176\u904b\uff0c\u8abf\u5176\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5408\u5fb7\uff0c\u7121\u76f8\u596a\u502b\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u5347\u964d\uff0c\u4e0d\u5931\u5176\u5b9c\uff0c\u4e94\u904b\u5ba3\u884c\uff0c\u52ff\u4e56\u5176\u653f\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u6b63\u5473\uff0c\u5f9e\u9006\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7a3d\u9996\u518d\u62dc\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u662d\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u6b64\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u7db1\u7d00\uff0c\u8b8a\u5316\u4e4b\u6df5\u6e90\uff0c\u975e\u8056\u5e1d\u5b70\u80fd\u7aae\u5176\u81f3\u7406\u6b5f\uff0c\u81e3\u96d6\u4e0d\u654f\uff0c\u8acb\u9673\u5176\u9053\uff0c\u4ee4\u7d42\u4e0d\u6ec5\uff0c\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u6613\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u592b\u5b50\u63a8\u800c\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f9e\u5176\u985e\u5e8f\u5206\u5176\u90e8\u4e3b\uff0c\u5225\u5176\u5b97\u53f8\uff0c\u662d\u5176\u6c23\u6578\uff0c\u660e\u5176\u6b63\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u805e\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5148\u7acb\u5176\u5e74\u4ee5\u660e\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u91d1\u6728\u6c34\u706b\u571f\u904b\u884c\u4e4b\u6578\uff0c\u5bd2\u6691\u71e5\u6fd5\u98a8\u706b\u81e8\u5fa1\u4e4b\u5316\uff0c\u5247\u5929\u9053\u53ef\u898b\uff0c\u6c11\u6c23\u53ef\u8abf\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u5377\u8212\uff0c\u8fd1\u800c\u7121\u60d1\uff0c\u6578\u4e4b\u53ef\u6578\u8005\uff0c\u8acb\u9042\u8a00\u4e4b\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: The six transformations and six changes are victorious in treating disorders, sweet and bitter, salty and sour, and then there is mild and sharp. I know it well. As for the transformation of the five phases, it can be from the five qi or against the five qi, from the celestial qi while against the terrestrial qi or from the terrestrial qi while against the celestial qi, sometimes they match and sometimes they don't. I am unable to discern this matter. To harmonize heaven's records and understand earth's principles, regulate the phases and refine their transformations, so that above and below are in harmony with virtue, without taking each other's rights, heaven and earth ascend and descend without deviating from their proper times, the five phases unfold. Let there be no deviation of governance, refine its true taste, and follow the reversals. How can this be done?</p> <p>The Duke said in response: Truly, your question is profound. This is the celestial record of heaven and earth's changes and the deep origins of transformations, which cannot be fully understood by a sacred emperor.

Heaven is active with Yang, while Earth is clear with Yin. This results in a predominance of Yang, bringing heat and drought to the point where things harden and become brittle; the wind blows strongly, and there is great movement in the air. There is an excess of Yang over Yin; rain clouds move towards the water regions and humidity spreads. The heat reaches its extreme while the moisture spreads, causing weeds to die and insects to appear. Water does not freeze and people suffer from diseases that alternate between cold and fever. The disease is marked by a flush in the face and swelling of the body; there is difficulty in sleeping, coughing, and vomiting; the urine is yellow or red. When Yang becomes dominant, the people relax, things flourish, and there are great honors for the people. This is followed by a benevolent government of Heaven that brings coolness and the harmonious blending of heat and drought. When Yang reaches its extreme, the land is fertile and the grain white; idle grain turns black and shrivels like feathers, while gold, fire, and brightness unite in harmony, and respond to the divine radiance of Heaven. The government changes suddenly and becomes arbitrary, causing insects to appear and water not to freeze. People suffer from diseases that alternate between fever and chills, with violent shaking, shivering, and insomnia; the hair comes out in clumps, fevers come suddenly, and parasites injure people, while their symptoms are agitated and confused. This is followed by a government of cold and rain, which causes diseases to break out violently, with convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, and pain in the heart, throat, and swellings, sores, chills, and weakness in the limbs and bleeding from the vessels. The fifth kind of climate is marked by the return of spring, when plants flourish again, and people are at peace. This brings about a harmonious balance between Heaven and Earth, bringing an end to pestilence. Those who know the subtle distinctions between heat and cold will distinguish between them and prescribe treatments accordingly. The principle is to follow nature in all things. To reverse the order of things would be disorderly and chaotic. This is a summary of the principles underlying the natural laws governing Heaven and Earth, and the cycles of Yin and Yang.</p> <p>26: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u653f\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5bc5\u7533\u4e4b\u7d00\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said: Good.

It also provides advice on balancing one's diet and lifestyle to maintain health and prevent disease. Here is the translation:</p> <p>Whenever there is an excess of Yang in governing Heaven, the vital energy flows first and precedes the operation of Yin. Heaven's energy is balanced, while Earth's energy is disturbed; winds are violent and sudden, trees sway, and fires flow. Yin operates within Yang, and rain falls in its proper season. Wood and Fire share similarities in their qualities, and they harmonize with the stars above.</p> <p>The grains are red and blue, the government is strict, and the orders are disordered. Hence, the wind is warm and humid, clouds rise and dissipate, the Yin energy spreads horizontally, cold arrives in its proper time, and cool breezes and rain fall together. The people become sick with cold, external boils and sores appear, while internally they experience discharge.</p> <p>When the sage encounters this situation, he harmonizes without contention. Going back and forth between these conditions, the people suffer from cold, fever, diarrhea, deafness, blindness, vomiting, and changes in complexion. The initial energy moves, Earth's energy shifts, winds prevail and shake, cold departs, the weather becomes warm, and plants flourish early.</p> <p>Cold does not kill, but diseases arise from the heat, and these diseases reside in the upper part of the body. Their energy is stagnant within the upper part. The second energy is marked by Fire's rebellion. White dust rises everywhere, clouds gather toward the rain center, winds are too humid, rain ceases to fall, and the people become healthy.</p> <p>In this stage, the diseases manifest as heat and rebellion, with external boils and sores appearing, the throat becoming painful, headaches accompanied by blood, fullness of the flanks and buboes, and feverish sensations. The third energy is marked by Heaven's order. The heat of summer arrives, and the Yang force nears its peak, while rain falls evenly.</p> <p>The people suffer from heat, with internal bleeding, external boils erupting, throats becoming hoarse, blood-filled headaches accompanied by fever, dizziness, and swollen buboes. The fourth energy is marked by the cooling of the Yin and Yang forces. The weather becomes clear, and the people's vital energy returns to harmony.</p> <p>Their bodies are heavy and full. In the fifth energy, Yang recedes, cold arrives, rain falls, and the gateway of the vital energy closes. Trees wither early, and the people avoid the cold by hiding. Sage individuals take precautions. By guiding the running energy, they applaud without end, but they must restrain the excess Yin energy, first by transforming its source, avoiding excessive violence, and preventing it from arising.</p> <p>Thus, in each year, appropriate use of salty and sour flavors is essential, draining and expelling what is excessive, using pickling to disperse, observing the vital energy's cold and warm influences to adjust its excesses, sharing similarities with other winds that are hot but characterized by cold, other winds that are hot but less marked by cold, using heat far away from heat, using warmth far away from warmth, using cold far away from cold, and using coolness far away from coolness. In this way, their diet and lifestyle follow the proper path of health maintenance and disease prevention.</p> <p>Anyone who is pretentious will reverse these principles, while those who are mistaken will become sick. Sickness is a measure of one's progress up the ladder, while mistakes occur in those with false understanding. These words describe the stages through which people pass as they move towards health or illness.</p> <p>38: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u653f\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e11\u672a\u4e4b\u7d00\u4e5f\uff0c The emperor asked: What is the policy of the Grand Minister?

It provides advice on how to maintain good health by adapting to the changing seasons and regulating one's diet accordingly. Here is a rough translation:</p> <p>Regarding this excessive yin governing heaven, after the transformation of qi flows, the yin emphasizes its politics, while yang qi retreats. When great winds arise, heavenly qi descends, and earthly qi rises; the original wilderness becomes misty and white dust arises in four directions, as clouds rush to the south pole. Cold rain falls frequently, and things reach a state of midsummer. The people suffer from cold dampness, their bellies are full, and their limbs swell with anger and distension; chills, cold obstructions, and urgent urgency afflict them; damp-cold combine, and white and black dust arises, spreading epidemics as the stars of the palace and the purveyor [constellations] rise.</p> <p>Their politics are stern, their decrees quiet, and their grains are dull and dark. Therefore, yin accumulates above, cold accumulates below; cold water defeats fire, resulting in hail or frost. Yang light cannot cure, causing qi to be stagnant and blocked in its course. Properly, it is beneficial to be high; do not go too low, and be early when appropriate; the advantage of earth lies in its qi transformation, and the people's qi also follow this.</p> <p>Initially, earthly qi moves, cold departs, spring qi is established, winds come, and myriad things grow and flourish. People feel their qi relaxed, and wind and dampness are sparse; rain comes later. The people suffer from an excess of blood, tense muscles and tendons, and joints are not well-suited.</p> <p>Second, when qi is great fire, things harmonize, and the people are at peace. Their diseases involve heat, expanse, and prevalence throughout near and far; dampness evaporates and rain comes in due time.</p> <p>Third, heaven's politics arrange, damp qi descends, earthly qi rises, and rain falls in due time as cold accompanies it. When affected by cold and dampness, the people suffer from full bellies and swollen limbs.</p> <p>Fourth, fearing fire approaching, dampness evaporates, earthly qi rises, heavenly qi is obscured, and there are cold winds at dawn and dusk. Dampness evaporates and forms white dew, thus establishing the autumn season. The people suffer from liver heat, blood boils over with fever, and the stomach and intestines are bloated and distended; in serious cases, they swell and become large.</p> <p>Fifth, as the disaster has already occurred, there is cold dew and early frost, and leaves of grasses turn yellow. Cold qi pervades the body, and people suffer from skin and sinew diseases.</p> <p>Finally, when cold and dampness accumulate, the water hardens into ice, and yang light cannot cure; affected by cold and dampness, qi flows together and causes illness, thus forming an epidemic. To prevent this, one must regulate the hazy qi and take advantage of its source, strengthen the seasonal qi, and do not let evil triumph; use grains to nourish true essence, and use leisure grains to preserve vitality. Therefore, in the year, one should regulate with bitter and dry warmth, especially so for those who have excess dampness; do not fail to excrete or disperse; if it does not disperse or excrete, then damp qi will overflow, flesh will decay, and skin will peel while blood and water interchange. One must encourage the Yang fire, protect against excessive cold, follow the qi's differences in abundance or scarcity, judge accordingly, and harmonize by following the same or opposite; for those who are the same, use heat to transform; for those who are damp, use dryness to transform; for opposites, use less of what is abundant and more of what is scarce, regulate with coolness from a distance, regulate with cold from afar, regulate with warmth from afar, and regulate with heat from afar. Misjudging this is disease; judging it correctly is health</p> <p>50: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u653f\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5b50\u5348\u4e4b\u7d00\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor asked, How is the administration of the Yin dynasty?

The grain is white, the politics are enlightened, and the harvest is bountiful. Cold and heat are balanced, and fire and water exist harmoniously, with the sun and moon shining brightly.</p> <p>Diseases begin when cold and heat are in balance; diseases of the upper body occur when heat predominates, and diseases of the lower body occur when cold predominates. The people suffer from coughing and wheezing, red eyes with protruding whites and skin eruptions, while those with abdominal pain have dry throats, swollen tongues, and bloody noses.</p> <p>As yang gradually increases, heat will begin to disappear, cold will start to manifest, and the qi will gradually retreat. Ice and frost will form, and wind will increase as yang becomes more concentrated. The people suffer from joint pain, stiffness in their limbs, and pain in their waist and lower back.</p> <p>As yang reaches its peak, the first stage of summer heat begins, with diseases appearing both internally and externally. In the second stage, yang spreads throughout the body, and wind becomes more prevalent. Cold appears as winter approaches, and the people suffer from chills, red eyes, and conjunctivitis.</p> <p>In the third stage, celestial politics prevail, and intense heat permeates all living beings, with lesser creatures flourishing. As cold becomes more pronounced, people experience heart and abdominal pain, as well as alternating feelings of cold and heat, coughing, red eyes, and skin eruptions.</p> <p>In the fourth stage, damp heat is at its peak, bringing heavy rains, with cold and heat existing in balance. People suffer from cold and heat-related diseases, having dry throats, yellow complexions, and painful joints.</p> <p>In the fifth stage, fear of fire increases, and summer becomes more intense, as yang transforms and all things flourish and grow. The people are healthy, but diseases with warm symptoms appear.</p> <p>Finally, in the sixth stage, dryness dominates, excess heat accumulates within, leading to swelling in the upper body. If coughing persists, blood will flow, and cold will periodically surface, causing haze and fog, leading to skin diseases that originate from within and spread throughout the sides, affecting the lower abdomen and leading to disorders of the middle jiao.</p> <p>To prevent these imbalances, one must regulate the qi, provide adequate nourishment for the season, control the excesses, use appropriate treatments based on the nature of the qi, and adjust dietary intake accordingly. By following this approach, one can maintain health and avoid disease.</p> <p>62: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u653f\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5df3\u4ea5\u4e4b\u7d00\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked, Good.

Managing qi and yin in heaven leads to balanced celestial phenomena. The air is calm above, while the earth's air is harmonious below; winds rise in distant places, fires ignite, heat advances in the sun, clouds gather at the horizon, humidity follows its course, qi and fire unite, the upper stars correspond with the year's cycle. Their policy is swift; their order is efficient; their crops are a deep blue-green. Idle crops are said to be too white; their writings have decayed feathers and wings. Winds are dry, fires are hot, and they change in turn, pests arrive with the changing of the seasons, waters do not freeze, hot diseases run rampant below, wind diseases run rampant above, the two combine in the middle. The first qi is cold; it begins to act. Cold qi accumulates and approaches its peak; people suffer from cold at the right lower side. The second qi is cold and does not depart; hoarfrost and snow fall, cold qi transforms into frost, affecting the upper parts of plants, and cold rain falls, Yang rises, and people suffer from heat in the middle. The third qi is governed by heaven's politics; winds arise on time, and people cry out with dizziness and blindness. The fourth qi struggles between scorching humidity; as it advances to the left upper side, people suffer from jaundice and swelling. The fifth qi is dominated by dryness and humidity, sinking yin spreads below, cold qi pervades bodies, winds and rains run rampant. Finally, the qi of death arrives; Yang rises in great abundance, pests emerge, waters do not freeze, earth's air expands, plants grow, people relax, their diseases are mild and warm, but they must ward off the evil qi, nurture their source of vital energy, praise their running qi, and ensure that evil does not triumph. Seasonally, use aromatics to adjust above and salty flavors below; beware of fire's qi without causing disorder; use warmth, heat, coolness, and cold from afar; eat according to the same law</p> <p>74: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u53ef\u8b02\u6089\u77e3\u3002\u7136\u4f55\u4ee5\u660e\u5176\u61c9\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u662d\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u516d\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u884c\u6709\u6b21\uff0c\u6b62\u6709\u4f4d\uff0c\u6545\u5e38\u4ee5\u6b63\u6708\u6714\u65e5\u5e73\u65e6\u8996\u4e4b\uff0c\u89a9\u5176\u4f4d\u800c\u77e5\u5176\u6240\u5728\u77e3\u3002\u904b\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u5176\u81f3\u5148\uff0c\u904b\u4e0d\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u81f3\u5f8c\uff0c\u6b64\u5929\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u904b\u975e\u6709\u9918\u975e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u6b63\u6b72\uff0c\u5176\u81f3\u7576\u5176\u6642\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u52dd\u5fa9\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u5176\u5e38\u5728\u4e5f\uff0c\u707d\u771a\u6642\u81f3\u5019\u4e5f\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u975e\u6c23\u5316\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u707d\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor said: Good. What you have said can be considered comprehensive. However, how can I understand the timing of it? Duke of Zhou said: It is about clarification. The six qi have an order in which they proceed and a position where they stop, so we always observe them on the day of the new moon and equinox, discerning their positions and knowing their locations. The presence or absence of excess or deficiency marks when it reaches its extreme, and if it fails to arrive at its due time, this is the way of heaven and the constant of the qi. If there is neither an excess nor a deficit, this is the proper season, and it should occur at the appropriate time. Emperor said: The qi of victory and defeat, what about its constant and its role as an omen?

Duke of Zhou replied: The use of Qi is how much, the transformation of change is how abundant or diminished, abundance and diminishment are how similar in their transformations. The Emperor said: May I hear about the similarity in transformation? Duke of Zhou replied: When warmth is in harmony with spring's transformation, when heat and drowsiness are in harmony with summer's transformation, when victory and defeat are in harmony with autumn's transformation, when clarity, dryness, mist, and dew are in harmony with the transformation of long summer, when clouds and rain are in harmony with hazy autumn, when cold and frost are in harmony with winter's transformation, these are the transformations of the five phases of heaven and earth and the six Qi. This is also their constant cycle of abundance and diminishment. The Emperor said: In the transformations of the five phases that correspond to heaven's mark, I know this already. May I hear about the similarity in transformation for the land? Duke of Zhou replied: When it is too excessive, there are three transformations that correspond to heaven, and when it falls short, there are also three transformations that correspond to heaven. When it is too excessive or falls short, there are three transformations that correspond to the earth. These are what we call people at 24 years old. The Emperor said: May I hear of these? Duke of Zhou replied: In the case of those who have an excess of yang in their birth charts, add the excessive yin; in the case of those who have an excess of yin, add the insufficient yang. In the cases of those who have an excess of yang in their birth charts and are positioned next to insufficient yin, in the cases of those who have an excess of yin and are positioned next to insufficient yang, and in the cases of those who have an excess of yin and are positioned next to insufficient yang, these are three. In the cases of those who have a deficiency of yang in their birth charts and add the excessive yin; in the case of those who have a deficiency of yin and add the insufficient yang, in the case of those who have a deficiency of yin and are positioned next to insufficient yang, these are also three. The Emperor asked: What do add and be in mean? Duke of Zhou replied: When there is an excess that does not reach the proper level for heaven's mark, it is added as a sign of a year of birth. When there is a position that is neither too excessive nor too insufficient and is marked by changes in health and form, and life and death are early or delayed.</p> <p>77: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u7528\u5bd2\u9060\u5bd2\uff0c\u7528\u71b1\u9060\u71b1\uff0c\u4f59\u672a\u77e5\u5176\u7136\u4e5f\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u4f55\u8b02\u9060\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u71b1\u7121\u72af\u71b1\uff0c\u5bd2\u7121\u72af\u5bd2\uff0c\u5f9e\u8005\u548c\uff0c\u9006\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u656c\u754f\u800c\u9060\u4e4b\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u6642\u8208\u516d\u4f4d\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6eab\u6dbc\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53f8\u6c23\u4ee5\u71b1\uff0c\u7528\u71b1\u7121\u72af\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u4ee5\u5bd2\uff0c\u7528\u5bd2\u7121\u72af\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u4ee5\u6dbc\uff0c\u7528\u6dbc\u7121\u72af\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u4ee5\u6eab\uff0c\u7528\u6eab\u7121\u72af\uff0c\u9592\u6c23\u540c\u5176\u4e3b\u7121\u72af\uff0c\u7570\u5176\u4e3b\u5247\u5c0f\u72af\u4e4b\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u56db\u754f\uff0c\u5fc5\u8b39\u5bdf\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5176\u72af\u8005\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u6c23\u53cd\u6642\uff0c\u5247\u53ef\u4f9d\u5247\uff0c\u53ca\u52dd\u5176\u4e3b\u5247\u53ef\u72af\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u70ba\u671f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u904e\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u90aa\u6c23\u53cd\u52dd\u8005\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u7121\u5931\u5929\u4fe1\uff0c\u7121\u9006\u6c23\u5b9c\uff0c\u7121\u7ffc\u5176\u52dd\uff0c\u7121\u8d0a\u5176\u5fa9\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u81f3\u6cbb\u3002 Emperor said: Master Zhou said that hot makes one distant from heat, and cold makes one distant from cold. I do not know this to be true; I wish to hear what is meant by being distant. The Duke of Zhou said: Heat does not harm heat, cold does not harm cold, following them results in harmony, going against them results in illness, and it is not permissible to disrespect or fear them and keep a distance from them; this is called the six positions at the right time. Emperor said: How about moderate warmth and coolness? The Duke of Zhou said: Regulate the Qi with heat, do not harm heat, regulate the Qi with cold, do not harm cold, regulate the Qi with coolness, do not harm coolness, regulate the Qi with warmth, do not harm warmth, when there is no Qi, it does not harm its master without fault, if it goes against its master, it results in a small fault; this is called the four taboos, and it must be cautious. Emperor said: Good. What about the fault? The Duke of Zhou said: If the heavenly Qi reverses its proper timing, it can be adjusted accordingly; if it wins over its master, it can cause harm, establishing equilibrium as a goal but not exceeding it; this is called reversed Qi winning. Therefore, he says: There are no failures in following heaven's will, there is no going against the Qi's proper direction, there is no boasting in its victory, and there is no praising its recovery; this is called supreme governance.</p> <p>78: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u4e94\u904b\u6c23\u884c\u4e3b\u6b72\u4e4b\u7d00\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u5e38\u6578\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u81e3\u8acb\u6b21\u4e4b\u3002 The emperor asked, Is it good?

Qi of muddy water: violent shaking of mountains, thunder and lightning intermingling, dust, turning yellow and black, changing into white gas, drifting and exploding high up, striking rocks and flying in the air, floods suddenly rising and rivers spreading out, pastures, fields, and grazing lands. The Qi is there from its four energies. Gas stretching across the sky, floating and arising, portends disaster ahead.  Qi of pure water: clear heaven and earth, wind blowing, air fresh and crisp, great cold suddenly coming, grasses and trees wilting smoke, drought driving winds, mists rising up in numbers, killing the Qi as it approaches, grasses and trees parched and golden.  The Qi that is portended here has the energy of five. At night, a light dew, this being a sign ahead. Water Qi: Yang Qi separating, Yin Qi arising strongly, great cold coming, rivers freezing into frost and snow, extreme cold leading to ice, sometimes becoming yellow and black, flowing winds interweaving, which leads to frost killing, water seeing auspiciousness.  People's illnesses are characterized by cold guests, heart pain, lower back pain, the joints not being comfortable, bending and stretching not feeling good, with diarrhea appearing as a sign ahead. Yang light not treating, dark yin accumulating, white dust becoming dull, which is the Qi coming ahead, its energy two fires. Deeply hidden, mysterious, gas still seems to be scattered, dark with a hint of yellow, this being a sign ahead.  Wood Qi: deeply hidden, pale and dull, clouds stirring up the things of wood, great wind suddenly arriving, causing houses to collapse and breaking trees. People's illnesses are characterized by stomach pain at the junction of the heart and diaphragm, support on both sides, the throat not being able to swallow, food and drink not going down, extreme cases leading to ringing in the ears and dizziness, not recognizing people. Too pale wood Qi, all of heaven looking the same color, sometimes with gas pollution becoming yellow and black, hazy mud clouds not producing rain but suddenly coming ahead, its energy is without constancy.  Long rivers, grasses lying down, soft leaves showing yin, pines singing high mountains, being a sign ahead. Fire Qi: deeply hidden, swelling and bloated, great clarity not shining, flames of fire running, great heat arriving, mountains and streams burning, trees and wood becoming soggy, broad spaces leaping smoke, earth floating in frost and salt, stilling the water, withered vines and grasses becoming yellow, winds carrying confused speech, dampness turning into fog, which follows behind.  People's illnesses are characterized by deficient Qi, buboes, pustules, swelling of the flanks, ribs, face, four limbs, internal organs distending with pain, blood flowing and overflowing, seminal fluid coming short, eyes red and heart hot, extreme cases leading to stupefaction and regret, sometimes leading to sudden death. Great heat coming, sweating profusely, this being the Qi suddenly coming ahead, its energy is four. Moving again, then still, Yang extreme becoming Yin, dampness allowing Qi to be transformed and succeeding.

When the five energies are emitted, what does it mean when they are not in position? Duke of Zhou said: Order him to attend. Emperor said: Does attending have a number? Duke of Zhou said: Following always has thirty degrees and is irregular. Emperor said: What is it like when the energy reaches its height first? Duke of Zhou said: If the luck is too excessive, it will arrive first; if the luck is insufficient, it will arrive later. This is the usual pattern. Emperor said: Good. What is it like when the energy transforms at a time other than its proper time? Duke of Zhou said: If it is too excessive, it will transform at that time; if it is insufficient, it will not transform until later. It is rare for such a thing to happen. Emperor said: Good. What causes the five energies to transform in different ways at the four seasons? Duke of Zhou said: They have advancement and recession, coming early or late, so too much leads them to transform first, and insufficient leads them to transform later. Emperor said: I wish to hear about their progression, what do you mean by that? Duke of Zhou said: In spring, the energy moves westward; in summer, it moves northward; in autumn, it moves eastward; in winter, it moves southward. Thus, the energy of spring starts from below, that of autumn starts from above, that of summer starts from the center, and that of winter starts from the peak, the energy of spring starts from the left, that of autumn starts from the right, that of winter starts from behind, and that of summer starts from in front. This is the constant pattern of the four seasons' transformation. Therefore, at high places, winter energy is always present, and at low places, spring energy is always present. One must pay close attention to this.

Huan G\u00e9 said: Regarding the six Qi, each has its own use and limit before being transformed. Therefore, the Taiyin (Lung) transforms water, is applied to Taiyang (Large Intestine), Taiyang becomes cold, is applied to Shaoyang (Liver &amp; Gallbladder), Shaoyang becomes hot, is applied to Yangming (Stomach), Yangming becomes dry, is applied to Jueyin (Kidney), Jueyin transforms wind, and is applied to Taiyin again, each serving its location and indicating it. Emperor said: How does it naturally settle? Huan G\u00e9 said: When it naturally settles, it transforms. Emperor said: I wish to hear about its location. Huan G\u00e9 said: Assign a position and it will be there, but the Moon can only know it. Emperor said: What is the difference between excess and deficiency of the six positions? Huan G\u00e9 said: The excess of Tai and the deficiency of Shaos are different. The Tai is constantly moderate and gradually, while the Shaos are abrupt and perishable. Emperor said: How is the Qi of Heaven and Earth excess and deficiency? Huan G\u00e9 said: If there is insufficient Qi in Heaven, the Earth Qi follows it. If there is insufficient Qi on Earth, Heaven Qi comes after it. They dwell together in the middle, but if one predominates, disease will arise. Therefore, if superior wins, the Qi of Heaven will descend, and if inferior wins, the Qi of Earth will shift upward, with some more and some less, large differences in divisions. Small ones are small differences, and large ones are great differences, and when there is a great difference, positions become unstable, and Qi exchanges occur, leading to significant changes and disease arises. The Great Learning says: Observe the small differences of seven divisions, and observe the large differences of five divisions; their differences can be seen, and this is what it means.</p> <p>154: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u8ad6\u8a00\u71b1\u7121\u72af\u71b1\uff0c\u5bd2\u7121\u72af\u5bd2\uff0c\u4f59\u6b32\u4e0d\u9060\u5bd2\uff0c\u4e0d\u9060\u71b1\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u767c\u8868\u4e0d\u9060\u71b1\uff0c\u653b\u88cf\u4e0d\u9060\u5bd2\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u767c\u4e0d\u653b\u800c\u72af\u5bd2\u72af\u71b1\uff0c\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5bd2\u71b1\u5167\u8cca\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u76ca\u751a\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u7121\u75c5\u8005\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7121\u8005\u751f\u4e4b\uff0c\u6709\u8005\u751a\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u751f\u8005\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u9060\u71b1\u5247\u71b1\u81f3\uff0c\u4e0d\u9060\u5bd2\u5247\u5bd2\u81f3\u3002\u5bd2\u81f3\uff0c\u5247\u5805\u5426\u8179\u6eff\uff0c\u75db\u6025\u4e0b\u5229\u4e4b\u75c5\u751f\u77e3\u3002\u71b1\u81f3\uff0c\u5247\u8eab\u71b1\u5410\u4e0b\u970d\u4e82\uff0c\u7670\u75bd\u7621\u760d\uff0c\u7780\u9b31\u6ce8\u4e0b\uff0c\u77a4\u761b\u816b\u8139\uff0c\u5614\uff0c\u9f3d\u8842\u982d\u75db\uff0c\u9aa8\u7bc0\u8b8a\uff0c\u8089\u75db\u8840\u6ea2\u8840\u6cc4\uff0c\u6dcb\u959f\u4e4b\u75c5\u751f\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6642\u5fc5\u9806\u4e4b\uff0c\u72af\u8005\u6cbb\u4ee5\u52dd\u4e5f\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5a66\u4eba\u91cd\u8eab\uff0c\u6bd2\u4e4b\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u6545\u7121\u6b9e\uff0c\u4ea6\u7121\u6b9e\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5927\u7a4d\u5927\u805a\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u72af\u4e5f\uff0c\u8870\u5176\u592a\u534a\u800c\u6b62\uff0c\u904e\u8005\u6b7b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u9b31\u4e4b\u751a\u8005\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6728\u9b31\u9054\u4e4b\uff0c\u706b\u9b31\u767c\u4e4b\uff0c\u571f\u9b31\u596a\u4e4b\uff0c\u91d1\u9b31\u6cc4\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c34\u9b31\u6298\u4e4b\uff0c\u7136\u8abf\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u904e\u8005\u6298\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u754f\u4e5f\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u5beb\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5047\u8005\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u5047\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u5247\u7121\u7981\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u4e3b\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\u5ba2\u6c23\u52dd\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u81f3\u54c9\u8056\u4eba\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u5927\u5316\u904b\u884c\u4e4b\u7bc0\uff0c\u81e8\u5fa1\u4e4b\u7d00\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u653f\uff0c\u5bd2\u6691\u4e4b\u4eca\uff0c\u975e\u592b\u5b50\u5b70\u80fd\u901a\u4e4b\uff0c\u8acb\u85cf\u4e4b\u9748\u862d\u4e4b\u5ba4\uff0c\u7f72\u66f0\u516d\u5143\u6b63\u7d00\uff0c\u975e\u9f4b\u6212\u4e0d\u6562\u793a\uff0c\u614e\u50b3\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor: Well done. Confucius said that one should not overheat without causing heat, nor overcool without causing cold, but how can this be? Zengzi said, Indeed, I understand the question. Propose a state of not overheating and not overcooling. Emperor: If one does not propose and does not attack, causing both heat and cold, what is that like? Zengzi said: Heat and cold are internal adversaries; their illness becomes more severe. Emperor: May I hear how one without illness is like? Zengzi said: That which produces life is without illness, but that which produces sickness is excessive. Emperor: What is it like to produce life? Zengzi said: Not overheating leads to heat exhaustion, and not overcooling leads to cold exhaustion. When cold reaches its extreme, the abdomen becomes stiff and bloated, causing pain and urgent diarrhea; when heat reaches its extreme, the body has fever, chills, rashes, boils, carbuncles, joint pain, muscle pain with bleeding and leakage, and various diseases arise. Emperor: How should it be treated? Zengzi said: One must follow what is appropriate, treating what has invaded as defeat. Emperor asked about the toxicity of a woman's reproductive system: Zengzi said: There are those who suffer due to the uterus and those who do not. Emperor asked about the cause of the latter: Zengzi said: It accumulates and gathers, which is something to be wary of; if it weakens the kidneys, it will stop, but if it exceeds that, one will die. Emperor: Well done. How should one treat severe toxicity? Zengzi said: Wood treats toxicity, fire sends it out, earth takes it away, metal releases it, water breaks it, but regulating the qi, cutting off what is excessive by its fear, is called cauterization. Emperor: If there is none of this, what is it like? Zengzi said: Regulating qi and not allowing external influences to win out is like a ruler. The emperor said: How marvelous! The way of the sage is the regulation of heaven and earth's transformations, the rituals of governance, the principles of yin and yang, heat and cold, which even the greatest master cannot fully understand; I beg to preserve it in the Spiritual Hall and call it the Six Regularities. No one dares to reveal this. Be cautious in transmitting it.</p>"},{"location":"72_huangdi-neijing_ci-fa-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u523a\u6cd5\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5347\u964d\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u6c23\u4ea4\u6709\u8b8a\uff0c\u5373\u6210\u66b4\u9b31\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u77e5\u4e4b\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u9810\u6551\u751f\u9748\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u537b\u4e4e\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u7a3d\u9996\u518d\u62dc\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u662d\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\uff01\u81e3\u805e\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\uff0c\u65e2\u660e\u5929\u5143\uff0c\u9808\u7aae\u6cd5\u523a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6298\u9b31\u6276\u904b\uff0c\u88dc\u5f31\u5168\u771f\uff0c\u76db\u8832\u9918\uff0c\u4ee4\u9664\u65af\u82e6\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5347\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5373\u6709\u751a\u51f6\u4e5f\u3002\u6728\u6b32\u5347\u800c\u5929\u67f1\u7a92\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u6728\u6b32\u767c\u9b31\u4ea6\u9808\u5f85\u6642\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u4e95\u3002\u706b\u6b32\u5347\u800c\u5929\u84ec\u7a92\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u706b\u6b32\u767c\u9b31\u4ea6\u9808\u5f85\u6642\uff0c\u541b\u706b\u76f8\u706b\u540c\u523a\u5305\u7d61\u4e4b\u6ece\u3002\u571f\u6b32\u5347\u800c\u5929\u885d\u7a92\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u571f\u6b32\u767c\u9b31\u4ea6\u9808\u5f85\u6642\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u4fde\u3002\u91d1\u6b32\u5347\u800c\u5929\u82f1\u7a92\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u91d1\u6b32\u767c\u9b31\u4ea6\u9808\u6642\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u624b\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u7d93\u3002\u6c34\u6b32\u5347\u800c\u5929\u5167\u7a92\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c34\u6b32\u767c\u9b31\u4ea6\u9808\u5f85\u6642\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u5408\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: When there is no rise or fall, the circulation of Qi has changed and becomes wild chaos. I already know this. How can one prevent and treat life spirit? What can be obtained from it? Duke of Zhou knelt down and offered worship again, answering, Excellent question! I have heard that Master said, when Heaven's vitality is clear, one must exhaustively explore the needles, able to break through chaos, support yang qi, strengthen the gate, and eliminate the remainder, eliminating this suffering. The Emperor said: Please quickly explain it to me. Duke of Zhou answered: When there is no rise, it is indeed ominous. Wood intends to rise but heavenly pillar suppresses it; wood also intending to release chaos needs time, at the jinmen intersection. Fire intends to rise but heavenly net suppresses it; fire also intending to release chaos needs time, strike fire and fire same strike bag of skin. Earth intends to rise but heavenly rampart suppresses it; earth also intending to release chaos needs time, at the jinmen intersection. Gold intends to rise but heavenly emblem suppresses it; gold also intending to release chaos needs time, strike hand jinmen intersection.

Obstinate says: Once the ascending is made clear, it must reach the descending. The method of ascending and descending can be regulated beforehand. Wood wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, scatters it so that it may obtain a position, when it descends and binds and releases it, it is as if waiting for its time; when it descends but does not enter, it can be quickly done. It can defeat what it has overcome, and should pierce the hand at where Yang Ming enters, and at where Taiyin issues forth. Fire wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, and it can scatter when it is scattered, it should defeat what it has overcome, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where Shao Yin issues forth and where Taiyang enters. Earth wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, and scatters when it can enter, it should defeat its victory, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where Shao Yang issues forth and where Taiyang enters. Gold wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it scatters its binding and releases it, and when it is scattered, it can enter, it should defeat what it has overcome, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where the Heart Protector and Biceps issue forth and at where Shao Yang enters. Water wishes to descend but the earth tightly binds and restrains it; when it descends without entering, it binds and releases it, and scatters when it can enter, it should defeat its soil, and it can disperse its binding, piercing at where Taiyin issues forth and where Yang Ming enters.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u904b\u4e4b\u81f3\uff0c\u6709\u524d\u5f8c\u8207\u5347\u964d\u5f80\u4f86\uff0c\u6709\u6240\u627f\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u805e\u4e4e\uff1f\u523a\u6cd5\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7576\u53d6\u5176\u5316\u6e90\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u6545\u592a\u904e\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ca\u8cc7\u4e4b\u3002\u592a\u904e\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b21\u6291\u5176\u9b31\uff0c\u53d6\u5176\u904b\u4e4b\u5316\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee4\u6298\u9b31\u6c23\u3002\u4e0d\u53ca\u6276\u8cc7\uff0c\u4ee5\u6276\u904b\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u865b\u90aa\u4e5f\u3002\u8cc7\u53d6\u4e4b\u6cd5\u4ee4\u51fa\u300a\u5bc6\u8a9e\u300b\u3002 The Emperor asked: When the Five Phases are at their peak, there is a movement of ascending and descending, front and back, and there is something that restrains them. Can you hear about it? The Master of Needle and Thread replied: You must take hold of its source. Thus, if you overdo it, you do not benefit the resource. Overdoing it, you suppress the yin, taking hold of the phase's source, and cause the yin qi to contract. Not benefiting the support of resources, you use this to support the phase qi and ward off empty evil. The methods for taking hold of resources are found in the Secret Speech.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5347\u964d\u4e4b\u523a\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u8981\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u53f8\u5929\u672a\u5f97\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4f7f\u53f8\u5316\u4e4b\u5931\u5176\u5e38\u653f\uff0c\u5373\u842c\u5316\u4e4b\u6216\u5176\u7686\u5984\u3002\u7136\u8207\u6c11\u70ba\u75c5\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u5148\u9664\uff0c\u6b32\u6fdf\u7fa4\u751f\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u8aaa\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7a3d\u9996\u518d\u62dc\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\uff01\u8a00\u5176\u81f3\u7406\uff0c\u8056\u5ff5\u6148\u61ab\uff0c\u6b32\u6fdf\u7fa4\u751f\uff0c\u81e3\u4e43\u76e1\u9673\u65af\u9053\uff0c\u53ef\u7533\u6d1e\u5fae\u3002\u592a\u967d\u5fa9\u5e03\uff0c\u5373\u53a5\u9670\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\u6c23\u585e\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u7576\u5beb\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u6240\u6d41\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u5fa9\u5e03\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\u5373\u6c23\u585e\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u5fc3\u5305\u80f3\u8108\u4e4b\u6240\u6d41\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u5fa9\u5e03\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\u5373\u6c23\u7559\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u6240\u6d41\u3002\u592a\u9670\u5fa9\u5e03\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\u5247\u6c23\u585e\u672a\u901a\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u624b\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u6240\u6d41\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u5fa9\u5e03\uff0c\u5247\u967d\u660e\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\u5247\u6c23\u672a\u901a\u4e0a\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u624b\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u6240\u6d41\u3002\u967d\u660e\u5fa9\u5e03\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\u5247\u5fa9\u585e\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u6240\u6d41\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked, The needling of the ascending and descending vessels can discern the location of the disease. I wish to hear from the Grand Master Shu: what is the method for correcting the anomalies in the Celestial Office and guiding the transformations? It appears that if one mistakenly treats the multitude as patients, then the illness can be easily removed. Desiring to aid all living beings, I wish to hear your explanation.

Please don't retreat, I want to conquer the rest, without causing any mistakes, is it clear? Duke B\u00f6 said: When Qi exceeds, it will rebalance, which is called not overstepping boundaries. Make sure that the earthly energy does not degenerate, and the new appointment of the sky cannot be rebalanced, so I will restore the regulation as before. In a year with excess days of the Xu\u0430\u043dzi, the Yin retreats position because it is damp above, water changes into wood, and it should be needled at the foot of the Yin's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Renzhi, the Yangui retreats position because it is hot above, fire consumes wood, and it should be needled at the hand of the Yangui's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Jiazi, the Taiyin retreats position because it is damp above, rain changes into metal, and it should be needled at the foot of the Taiyin's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Gengxi, the Shaoyang retreats position because it is hot above, fire consumes wood, and it should be needled at the hand of the Shaoyang's entrance. In a year with excess days of the Jichou, the Taiyang does not retreat position because it is cold above, ice changes into water, and it should be needled at the foot of the Shao yin's entrance. Therefore, when heavenly energy is reversed and turns into human disease, using law to needle will prevent the onset of diseases.</p> <p>6: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u525b\u67d4\u4e8c\u5e72\uff0c\u5931\u5b88\u5176\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5929\u904b\u4e4b\u6c23\u7686\u865b\u4e4e\uff1f\u8207\u6c11\u70ba\u75c5\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u5e73\u4e4e\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6df1\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\uff01\u660e\u5176\u5967\u65e8\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u8fed\u79fb\uff0c\u4e09\u5e74\u5316\u75ab\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u6839\u4e4b\u53ef\u898b\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u9003\u9580\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: The hard and the soft, if they lose their positions, will all become empty in terms of celestial influences.

If this lasts for three years, it will result in a great plague. Analyzing its subtlety and depth, it can be acupunctured at the point that can be pierced; then it should first supplement Qi Gong. After three days, it can acupuncture at the foot-Taiyin where it is located. There are also those who, in a submissive position of Jupiter in Mao, do not reach Jiazi alone, and in the next three years they will have a disease of the soil; its treatment is to supplement Guan. Its acupuncture is completed, and there is no need for night travel or distant travel. On the seventh day, it should be purified, clean and pure abstinence. All those who have come with old disease in their lower Qi can be treated by facing south at the time of Chongwu, cleaning their spirits to avoid chaos, holding their breath for seven breaths, guiding their necks to swallow Qi naturally, as if swallowing hard objects; after seven breaths, the saliva will make the water below abundant.</p> <p>8: \u5047\u4ee4\u4e19\u5bc5\uff0c\u525b\u67d4\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u4e0a\u525b\u5e72\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u4e0b\u67d4\u4e0d\u53ef\u7368\u4e3b\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e2d\u6c34\u904b\u975e\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u57f7\u6cd5\u800c\u5b9a\u4e4b\uff0c\u5e03\u5929\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u800c\u5931\u5b88\u4e0a\u6b63\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u4e0d\u5408\uff0c\u5373\u5f8b\u5442\u97f3\u7570\uff0c\u5982\u6b64\u5373\u5929\u904b\u5931\u5e8f\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u8b8a\u75ab\u3002\u8a73\u5176\u5fae\u751a\uff0c\u5dee\u6709\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5f90\u81f3\u5373\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\uff0c\u81f3\u751a\u5373\u9996\u4e09\u5e74\uff0c\u7576\u5148\u88dc\u5fc3\u4fde\uff0c\u6b21\u4e94\u65e5\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u814e\u4e4b\u6240\u5165\u3002\u53c8\u6709\u4e0b\u4f4d\u5730\u7532\u5b50\uff0c\u8f9b\u5df3\u67d4\u4e0d\u9644\u525b\uff0c\u4ea6\u540d\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u5373\u5730\u904b\u7686\u865b\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u8b8a\u6c34\u7658\uff0c\u5373\u523a\u6cd5\u7686\u5982\u6b64\u77e3\u3002\u5176\u523a\u5982\u7562\uff0c\u614e\u5176\u5927\u559c\u6b32\u60c5\u65bc\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4e0d\u5fcc\uff0c\u5373\u5176\u6c23\u5fa9\u6563\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ee4\u975c\u4e03\u65e5\uff0c\u5fc3\u6b32\u5be6\uff0c\u4ee4\u5c11\u601d\u3002 Assuming it is Bingchen, hard and soft fail to maintain, above hard dry fails to maintain, below soft cannot be independent, middle water does not exceed, cannot execute law and define it, there are extras in the sky, but fail to maintain the correct above, heaven and earth not matching, then the laws Luo sound is different, if so, then the celestial circulation fails order, later three years changed disease.

The superior position is out of balance, and the inferior position has no harmony. The interaction between Jia and Geng brings good fortune in gold, but since this is not mutual attraction, the heavenly cycle cannot be completed. The superior and inferior positions are out of sync, and thus can be called out of balance. A woman named Lin Zhong from Guan and a merchant from Shang have no harmony in their voices either. Then, the heavenly fortune will transform and change into a great epidemic in three years' time. In terms of the numbers involved, there is a slight discrepancy, both small and large, by the third year, and at this point, it is said that the liver will be afflicted first. After three days have passed, one can perform an acupuncture treatment on the lung meridian. When the needles are removed, one should rest and refrain from anger; being angry will cause the true qi to disperse. Alternatively, in the case of those born during the period of Bing-Shen and Ding-Wu, or when a woman named Lin Zhong is present, it can be treated by needling the yin and yang meridians using Jia's yang and Geng's yin, which are also considered out of balance. This condition is known as golden weakness, and its onset should be expected after a certain period of time. By examining the differences between the numbers involved, one can determine whether it will come quickly or slowly. In the case of those born during Jia's yin and Geng's yang phases, the advice is the same: do not get angry.</p> <p>10: \u5047\u4ee4\u58ec\u5348\uff0c\u525b\u67d4\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u4e0a\u58ec\u672a\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e01\u7368\u7136\uff0c\u5373\u96d6\u967d\u5e74\uff0c\u8667\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u76f8\u62db\u5176\u6709\u671f\uff0c\u5dee\u4e4b\u5fae\u751a\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u5176\u6578\u4e5f\uff0c\u5f8b\u5442\u4e8c\u89d2\uff0c\u5931\u800c\u4e0d\u548c\uff0c\u540c\u97f3\u6709\u65e5\uff0c\u5fae\u751a\u5982\u898b\uff0c\u4e09\u5e74\u5927\u75ab\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u813e\u4e4b\u4fde\uff0c\u6b21\u4e09\u65e5\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u809d\u4e4b\u6240\u51fa\u4e5f\u3002\u523a\u7562\uff0c\u975c\u795e\u4e03\u65e5\uff0c\u52ff\u5927\u9189\u6b4c\u6a02\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u5fa9\u6563\uff0c\u53c8\u52ff\u98fd\u98df\uff0c\u52ff\u98df\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u6b32\u4ee4\u813e\u5be6\uff0c\u6c23\u7121\u6eef\u98fd\uff0c\u7121\u4e45\u5750\uff0c\u98df\u7121\u592a\u9178\uff0c\u7121\u98df\u4e00\u5207\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u5b9c\u7518\u5b9c\u6de1\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u5730\u4e0b\u7532\u5b50\uff0c\u4e01\u9149\u5931\u5b88\u5176\u4f4d\uff0c\u672a\u5f97\u4e2d\u53f8\uff0c\u5373\u6c23\u4e0d\u7576\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e0d\u8207\u58ec\u5949\u5408\u8005\uff0c\u4ea6\u540d\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u975e\u540d\u5408\u5fb7\uff0c\u6545\u67d4\u4e0d\u9644\u525b\uff0c\u5373\u5730\u904b\u4e0d\u5408\uff0c\u4e09\u5e74\u8b8a\u7658\uff0c\u5176\u523a\u6cd5\u4e00\u5982\u6728\u75ab\u4e4b\u6cd5\u3002 Assuming it is Ren Wuyin, the following literary Chinese text can be translated to English:  If during the Yin Period of Ren, the balance between firmness and flexibility is lost, in the Xin year, this is particularly unfortunate. Above (the body) is governed by the metal element (of the Jupiter day master), below by fire (Earth day master). The loss of harmony leads to different periods where firmness and flexibility are out of balance. The principles can be likened to the concept of lu lu er jiao, whereby in order to restore balance, there must be a day of rest and one of activity, each with its own significance. Two years later (from the beginning of imbalance), the Bladder and Gallbladder meridians should be treated, followed by seven days of calm, avoiding excesses such as alcohol and rich food to allow the energy to return to normal. Foods should also be avoided that are too sour, sweet or overly stimulating.</p> <p>Another scenario is if the Wood element (Jupiter day master) is out of balance in the year of the Rooster. If the Wood element is unable to combine with other elements due to imbalance, this is also known as being out of balance. In this situation, flexibility does not attach itself to firmness and energy will not flow properly. The body can experience discomfort for three years and the treatment should be similar to that used in treating mu (wood) disease.</p> <p>11: \u5047\u4ee4\u620a\u7533\uff0c\u525b\u67d4\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u620a\u7678\u96d6\u706b\u904b\uff0c\u967d\u5e74\u4e0d\u592a\u904e\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e0a\u5931\u5176\u525b\uff0c\u67d4\u5730\u7368\u4e3b\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e0d\u6b63\uff0c\u6545\u6709\u90aa\u5e72\uff0c\u8fed\u79fb\u5176\u4f4d\uff0c\u5dee\u6709\u6de1\u6df1\uff0c\u6b32\u81f3\u5c07\u5408\uff0c\u97f3\u5f8b\u5148\u540c\uff0c\u5982\u6b64\u5929\u904b\u5931\u6642\uff0c\u4e09\u5e74\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u706b\u75ab\u81f3\u77e3\uff0c\u7576\u523a\u80ba\u4e4b\u4fde\u3002\u523a\u7562\uff0c\u975c\u795e\u4e03\u65e5\uff0c\u52ff\u5927\u60b2\u50b7\u4e5f\uff0c\u60b2\u50b7\u5373\u80ba\u52d5\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u6c23\u5fa9\u6563\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eba\u6b32\u5be6\u80ba\u8005\uff0c\u8981\u5728\u606f\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u5730\u4e0b\u7532\u5b50\uff0c\u7678\u4ea5\u5931\u5b88\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u67d4\u5931\u5b88\u4f4d\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u4e0a\u5931\u5176\u525b\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u4ea6\u540d\u620a\u7678\u4e0d\u76f8\u5408\u5fb7\u8005\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u904b\u8207\u5730\u865b\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u8b8a\u7658\uff0c\u5373\u540d\u706b\u7658\u3002 Suppose it is a Wuxu year, with Yin and Yang losing balance, although the Fire element runs through the Wu and Gui years, Yang's influence is not too strong. The firm aspect fails above, while the soft aspect stands alone, its energy is not correct, hence there are misfortune and disasters, changing positions and varying in depth, almost coming together, music and rhythm coincide, so when heavenly luck fails, within three years, fire will come upon us. During this time, one must pierce the lungs at the junction of the lung meridian. Afterward, remain quiet for seven days, do not be excessively sad, for sorrow disturbs the lungs and scatters true energy, those who wish to truly heal their lungs must focus on regulating breath. Alternatively, if one loses the Gui earth element in Jiazi or Gengchen years, they have lost both balance and firmness, and share the unsuitability of Wuxu years.

The symptoms are similar, and without proper treatment, how can one avoid transmission? Duke of Bizarre replied: Those who do not contract it have pure Qi inside, while evil cannot affect them. They avoid its toxic Qi. The Yin has been following this practice from ancient times and still continues to be followed today. When the Qi comes out of the brain, it is not evil. The Qi coming out of the brain corresponds to the mind like the sun. To enter the epidemic room, first imagine the green Qi coming out from the liver on the left and moving eastward, transforming into trees and plants. Then imagine the white Qi coming out from the lungs on the right and moving westward, transforming into armor and weapons. Then imagine the red Qi coming out of the heart and moving northwards, transforming into light. Then imagine the black Qi coming out from the kidneys and moving southwards, transforming into water. Finally, imagine the yellow Qi coming out from the spleen and staying in the center, transforming into earth. When the five Qis have protected the body, one should visualize a shining image of the North Pole on top of their head before entering the epidemic room.</p> <p>14: \u53c8\u4e00\u6cd5\uff0c\u65bc\u6625\u5206\u4e4b\u65e5\uff0c\u65e5\u672a\u51fa\u800c\u5410\u4e4b\u3002\u53c8\u4e00\u6cd5\uff0c\u65bc\u96e8\u6c34\u65e5\u5f8c\uff0c\u4e09\u6d74\u4ee5\u85e5\u6cc4\u6c57\u3002\u53c8\u4e00\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c0f\u91d1\u4e39\u65b9\uff1a\u8fb0\u7802\u4e8c\u5169\uff0c\u6c34\u78e8\u96c4\u9ec3\u4e00\u5169\uff0c\u8449\u5b50\u96cc\u9ec3\u4e00\u5169\uff0c\u7d2b\u91d1\u534a\u5169\uff0c\u540c\u5165\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u56fa\u4e86\uff0c\u5730\u4e00\u5c3a\u7bc9\u5730\u5be6\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u7210\uff0c\u4e0d\u9808\u85e5\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u706b\u4e8c\u5341\u65a4\u7146\u4e4b\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e03\u65e5\u7d42\uff0c\u5019\u51b7\u4e03\u65e5\u53d6\uff0c\u6b21\u65e5\u51fa\u5408\u5b50\uff0c\u57cb\u85e5\u5730\u4e2d\u4e03\u65e5\uff0c\u53d6\u51fa\u9806\u65e5\u7814\u4e4b\u4e09\u65e5\uff0c\u7149\u767d\u6c99\u871c\u70ba\u4e38\uff0c\u5982\u68a7\u6850\u5b50\u5927\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e5\u671b\u6771\u5438\u65e5\u83ef\u6c23\u4e00\u53e3\uff0c\u51b0\u6c34\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e38\uff0c\u548c\u6c23\u56a5\u4e4b\uff0c\u670d\u5341\u7c92\uff0c\u7121\u75ab\u5e72\u4e5f\u3002 Another method, on the vernal equinox day, vomit before sunrise.

I wish to hear about acupuncture. The Duke of Tang bowed and paid homage again, saying, Your Majesty's question is indeed profound! By speaking of a spirit that wanders without restraint, although it exists within the body, it does not result in death and may involve evil influences, thus causing untimely death. Just as when Yin is out of balance, Heaven punishes with emptiness, and a person's liver and gallbladder are empty, feeling Heaven's emptiness, their soul wanders above, allowing evil influences to control the great Qi, while the body still has warmth, acupuncture can be applied at the point where the foot channel of the lesser Yang passes through, followed by needling the Liver. When a person suffers from heart disease and encounters the influence of the Fire emperor who fails to maintain balance, they feel three levels of emptiness and encounter fire that does not reach, causing black corpses and ghosts to attack, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the hand channel of the lesser Yang passes through, followed by needling the heart. A person's spleen disease, when the Taiyin function fails to maintain balance, feels three levels of emptiness and encounters earth that does not reach, causing green corpses and ghosts to attack the person violently, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the foot channel of Yang Ming passes through, followed by needling the spleen. When a person suffers from lung disease and encounters the influence of Yang Ming who fails to maintain balance, they feel three levels of emptiness, and encounter metal that does not reach, causing red corpses and ghosts to attack the person violently, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the hand channel of Yang Ming passes through, followed by needling the lung. A person's kidney disease, when the Taiyang function fails to maintain balance and encounters water that does not reach during its phase, causes yellow corpses and ghosts to attack a person's pure Qi, draining their soul, leading to violent death. Acupuncture can be applied at the point where the foot channel of Taiyang passes through, and needling the foot channel of lesser Yang</p> <p>16: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5341\u4e8c\u85cf\u4e4b\u76f8\u4f7f\uff0c\u795e\u5931\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f7f\u795e\u5f69\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5713\uff0c\u6050\u90aa\u5e72\u72af\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u53ef\u523a\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u8981\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7a3d\u9996\u518d\u62dc\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\uff0c\u554f\u81f3\u7406\uff0c\u9053\u771f\u5b97\uff0c\u6b64\u975e\u8056\u5e1d\uff0c\u7109\u7a76\u65af\u6e90\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u6c23\u795e\u5408\u9053\uff0c\u5951\u7b26\u4e0a\u5929\u3002\u5fc3\u8005\uff0c\u541b\u4e3b\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u795e\u660e\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u80ba\u8005\uff0c\u76f8\u50b3\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u6cbb\u7bc0\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u624b\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u809d\u8005\uff0c\u5c07\u8ecd\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u8b00\u616e\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u81bd\u8005\uff0c\u4e2d\u6b63\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u6c7a\u65b7\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u81bb\u4e2d\u8005\uff0c\u81e3\u4f7f\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u559c\u6a02\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u5fc3\u5305\u80f3\u6240\u6d41\u3002\u813e\u70ba\u8aeb\u8b70\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u77e5\u5468\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u813e\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u80c3\u70ba\u5009\u5ee9\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u4e94\u5473\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u80c3\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u5927\u8178\u8005\uff0c\u50b3\u9053\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u8b8a\u5316\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u5927\u8178\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u5c0f\u8178\u8005\uff0c\u53d7\u76db\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u5316\u7269\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u53ef\u523a\u5c0f\u8178\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u814e\u8005\uff0c\u4f5c\u5f37\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u4f0e\u5de7\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u523a\u5176\u814e\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u4e09\u7126\u8005\uff0c\u6c7a\u7006\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u6c34\u9053\u51fa\u7109\uff0c\u523a\u4e09\u7126\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u8180\u80f1\u8005\uff0c\u5dde\u90fd\u4e4b\u5b98\uff0c\u7cbe\u6db2\u85cf\u7109\uff0c\u6c23\u5316\u5247\u80fd\u51fa\u77e3\uff0c\u523a\u8180\u80f1\u4e4b\u6e90\u3002\u51e1\u6b64\u5341\u4e8c\u5b98\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u76f8\u5931\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u6545\u523a\u6cd5\u6709\u5168\u795e\u990a\u771f\u4e4b\u65e8\uff0c\u4ea6\u6cd5\u6709\u4fee\u771f\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u975e\u6cbb\u75be\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u8981\u4fee\u990a\u548c\u795e\u4e5f\u3002\u9053\u8cb4\u5e38\u5b58\uff0c\u88dc\u795e\u56fa\u6839\uff0c\u7cbe\u6c23\u4e0d\u6563\uff0c\u795e\u5b88\u4e0d\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u5373\u795e\u5b88\u800c\u96d6\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u4ea6\u5168\u771f\uff0c\u4eba\u795e\u4e0d\u5b88\uff0c\u975e\u9054\u81f3\u771f\uff0c\u81f3\u771f\u4e4b\u8981\uff0c\u5728\u4e4e\u5929\u7384\uff0c\u795e\u5b88\u5929\u606f\uff0c\u5fa9\u5165\u672c\u5143\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u6b78\u5b97\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked: If the twelve channels are out of balance, causing the Qi and spirit to be disordered, there is a fear that evil forces will invade, and acupuncture can be used to treat it. I would like to know the essence of this method. Great Master kowtowed again and said: Indeed, your question is profound and your teaching is true. This is not about a holy emperor; how could it be so originated? It is called the harmony of Qi and spirit, corresponding with heaven's symbols. The heart is the official of the ruler, where the spirit emerges from, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the small intestine meridian. The lung is the official of transmission, where Qi regulation emerges, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the kidney meridian. The liver is the official of the general, where strategies emerge, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the liver meridian. The spleen is the official of deliberation, where discernment emerges, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the stomach meridian. The large intestine is the official of centrality, where decisions emerge, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the gallbladder meridian. The triple burner is the official of transformation, where skill emerges, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the triple burner meridian. The bladder is the official of storage, where essence accumulates, which will be able to flow out, and acupuncture can be used on the source of the bladder meridian. The twelve channels mentioned above must not lose their balance. Therefore, the principles of acupuncture have both nourishing the true Qi and cultivating the truth, not for treating illnesses; instead, it focuses on nurturing and harmonizing the spirit. Precious is this constant presence, supplementing the root of the spirit, keeping the Qi from dispersing, and keeping the spirit undivided; even if the spirit is kept intact but does not leave, it is still complete in truth, and the spirit that does not leave will return to its original source, called returning to the ancestral temple.</p>"},{"location":"73_huangdi-neijing_ben-bing-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u672c\u75c5\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5143\u4e5d\u7a92\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u77e5\u4e4b\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u6c23\u4ea4\uff0c\u4f55\u540d\u5931\u5b88\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8b02\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5347\u964d\uff0c\u9077\u6b63\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u7d93\u8ad6\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u5404\u6709\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u6545\u540d\u5931\u5b88\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u6545\u6c23\u4ea4\u5931\u6613\u4f4d\uff0c\u6c23\u4ea4\u8ffa\u8b8a\uff0c\u8b8a\u6613\u975e\u5e38\uff0c\u5373\u56db\u6642\u5931\u5e8f\uff0c\u842c\u5316\u4e0d\u5b89\uff0c\u8b8a\u6c11\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked, The Heavenly Pivot consists of nine orifices, which I already know.

Hence, it is called 'misaligned guard.'

Thus, there is the absence of ascent and descent, ascending to heaven, with both ascending and descending not advancing, they make such a distinction, and the changes of Qi have their differences, always varying and constantly different, disasters, whether great or small, follow this pattern</p> <p>4: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u6c23\u4ea4\u9047\u6703\u52dd\u6291\u4e4b\u7531\uff0c\u8b8a\u6210\u6c11\u75c5\uff0c\u8f15\u91cd\u4f55\u5982\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u52dd\u76f8\u6703\uff0c\u6291\u4f0f\u4f7f\u7136\u3002\u662f\u6545\u8fb0\u620c\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u6728\u6c23\u5347\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e3b\u9022\u5929\u67f1\uff0c\u52dd\u800c\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u53c8\u9047\u5e9a\u620c\uff0c\u91d1\u904b\u5148\u5929\uff0c\u4e2d\u904b\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7136\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u6728\u904b\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u91d1\u8ffa\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u5347\u800c\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5373\u6e05\u751f\u98a8\u5c11\uff0c\u8085\u6bba\u65bc\u6625\uff0c\u9732\u971c\u5fa9\u964d\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u4e43\u840e\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u6eab\u75ab\u65e9\u767c\uff0c\u54bd\u55cc\u8ffa\u4e7e\uff0c\u56db\u80a2\u6eff\uff0c\u80a2\u7bc0\u7686\u75db\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u5373\u5927\u98a8\u6467\u62c9\uff0c\u6298\u9695\u9cf4\u7d0a\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u5352\u4e2d\u5fa7\u75f9\uff0c\u624b\u8db3\u4e0d\u4ec1\u3002 Emperor said: I wish to hear about the reasons for the occurrence of diseases that are caused by the meeting of qi and encounter, and how light or heavy they are. Duke of Zhou replied: The meeting of qi is victorious and suppresses the yin. Therefore, in the year of the Chenxu, the wood qi rises, controlling the pillars of heaven, triumphing but not advancing. It encounters the Jinzu, the metal phase precedes heaven, and the victorious phase is sudden but does not advance. The metal phase suppresses the wood phase, rising but not advancing, leading to a scarcity of clear life-giving energy, killing many in spring, and causing dew and frost to fall again. The plants wither away. People's diseases become warm fevers that occur early, throat and lips are dry, limbs are full, and joints all hurt. Over time, it turns into depression, leading to a great wind destroying crops, breaking branches and ringing sounds. People's diseases in the final stage are paralyzed, with no sensitivity in hands and feet.</p> <p>5: \u662f\u6545\u5df1\u4ea5\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u541b\u706b\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5929\u84ec\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u53c8\u53a5\u9670\u6728\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u5247\u5c11\u9670\u672a\u5f97\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u4ee5\u81f3\u5176\u4e2d\u8005\u3002\u541b\u706b\u6b32\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u4e2d\u6c34\u904b\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u5347\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5373\u6e05\u5bd2\u5fa9\u4f5c\uff0c\u51b7\u751f\u65e6\u66ae\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u4f0f\u967d\uff0c\u800c\u5167\u751f\u7169\u71b1\uff0c\u5fc3\u795e\u9a5a\u60b8\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u9592\u4f5c\u3002\u65e5\u4e45\u6210\u9b31\uff0c\u5373\u66b4\u71b1\u8ffa\u81f3\uff0c\u8d64\u98a8\u816b\u7ff3\uff0c\u5316\u75ab\uff0c\u6eab\u7658\u6696\u4f5c\uff0c\u8d64\u6c23\u7634\u800c\u5316\u706b\u75ab\uff0c\u7686\u7169\u800c\u8e81\u6e34\uff0c\u6e34\u751a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u4ee5\u6cc4\u4e4b\u53ef\u6b62\u3002 Therefore, in the year of Jia-hai, the fire of the emperor ascends to heaven, and the lord of the gate of heavenly peace reigns supreme, not being able to advance. Again, if the excessive yin changes its position to wood, then the lesser yin has not yet reached the point of ascending to heaven, and water energy penetrates it. The emperor's fire tries to rise, but is restrained by the water energy within, so that it cannot advance; this leads to a repetition of the clear cold, with daytime and nighttime chilliness. The people catch feverish colds, while internal heat produces discomfort, troubled minds and spirits. As time goes by, sudden high fevers arise, marked by redness of face, swelling, and plague, followed by a warm illness with hot feelings and sweating. The vital energy turns into fire sickness, manifesting as feverish disorders, restlessness, thirst, and inability to be cured.</p> <p>6: \u662f\u6545\u5b50\u5348\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5929\u6c96\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u58ec\u5b50\uff0c\u6728\u904b\u5148\u5929\u800c\u81f3\u8005\uff0c\u4e2d\u6728\u9047\u6291\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u5347\u5929\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5373\u98a8\u57c3\u56db\u8d77\uff0c\u6642\u8209\u57c3\u660f\uff0c\u96e8\u6ebc\u4e0d\u5316\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u98a8\u53a5\u6d8e\u6f6e\uff0c\u5fa7\u75f9\u4e0d\u96a8\uff0c\u8139\u6eff\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u4f0f\u9b31\uff0c\u5373\u9ec3\u57c3\u5316\u75ab\u4e5f\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u592d\u4ea1\uff0c\u81c9\u80a2\u5e9c\u9ec3\u75b8\u6eff\u9589\uff0c\u6ebc\u4ee4\u5f17\u5e03\uff0c\u96e8\u5316\u8ffa\u5fae\u3002 Therefore, in the Year of the Siwu, the Yang Fire ascends and governs the Opening of Heaven, triumphing without stopping. Also, one may encounter Xu Hai (Rabbit), when Wood Grain is ahead, indicating that Wood encounters constraint. Ascending without stopping means that Wind and Dust will suddenly arise, sometimes raising Dust and darkness, and rain not drying up. The people fall ill with Wind Stroke and Sweating Sickness, which do not progress in parallel, causing distention and fullness. If it continues, it results in the Yellow Dust plague, and the people's illness leads to death, with their faces and limbs yellow and swollen, closed like a bowl, while the rain does not evaporate, and dries up little by little.</p> <p>7: \u662f\u6545\u4e11\u672a\u4e4b\u5e74\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5929\u84ec\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u592a\u9670\u672a\u9077\u6b63\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u5c11\u9670\u672a\u5347\u5929\u4e5f\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u4ee5\u81f3\u8005\u3002\u5347\u5929\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5373\u5bd2\u96f0\u53cd\u5e03\uff0c\u51dc\u51bd\u5982\u51ac\uff0c\u6c34\u5fa9\u6db8\uff0c\u51b0\u518d\u7d50\uff0c\u6684\u6696\u4e4d\u4f5c\uff0c\u51b7\u5fa9\u5e03\u4e4b\uff0c\u5bd2\u6684\u4e0d\u6642\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u4f0f\u967d\u5728\u5167\uff0c\u7169\u71b1\u751f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fc3\u795e\u9a5a\u99ed\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u9592\u722d\u3002\u4ee5\u4e45\u6210\u9b31\uff0c\u5373\u66b4\u71b1\u8ffa\u751f\uff0c\u8d64\u98a8\u6c23\u77b3\u7ff3\uff0c\u5316\u6210\u9b31\u7658\uff0c\u8ffa\u4f5c\u4f0f\u71b1\u5167\u7169\uff0c\u75f9\u800c\u751f\u53a5\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u8840\u6ea2\u3002 Hence, in the year of the hour of Ch'ou before the birth of the Lesser Yin, the Sun ascends to Heaven, but will not advance. This is followed by a drought in the region governed by the Greater Yin, who has not moved into her proper position. When this occurs, it means that the water phase is approaching. If the sun does not advance, then cold mists pervade, like winter frost; the water again recedes, ice reforms, and for a time warmth appears, only to be followed by more cold. People become sick with internal heat of Yang, suffering fever and disturbance of spirit, which alternates between chill and warmth. If this continues for some time, it leads to a violent fever, redness and heat of the eyes, and changes into internal fever, causing pain and producing convulsions; in severe cases, there is bleeding.</p> <p>8: \u662f\u6545\u5bc5\u7533\u4e4b\u5e74\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5929\u82f1\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u620a\u620a\u5bc5\uff0c\u706b\u904b\u5148\u5929\u800c\u81f3\u3002\u91d1\u6b32\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u706b\u904b\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u5347\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5373\u6642\u96e8\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u897f\u98a8\u6578\u8209\uff0c\u9e79\u9e75\u71e5\u751f\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u4e0a\u71b1\u5598\u55fd\u8840\u6ea2\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u5373\u767d\u57c3\u7ff3\u9727\uff0c\u6e05\u751f\u6bba\u6c23\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u8105\u6eff\u60b2\u50b7\uff0c\u5bd2\u9f3d\u568f\u55cc\u4e7e\uff0c\u624b\u62c6\u76ae\u819a\u71e5\u3002 Therefore, during the year of the Tiger and Rabbit, Yin Ming ascended to heaven, presiding over the triumph of the Yellow Emperor, who was victorious without having to advance. There were also instances where one encountered two Wood Tigers. The Fire star arrived in the heavens early. Gold desired to ascend to heaven but was restrained by the Fire star, and therefore did not ascend, resulting in no rain falling at the appropriate time, west winds repeatedly rising, and the salted fish industry thriving. People fell ill with high fevers, panting, and bleeding. This then turned into a gloomy state, where white dust, haze, and purifying qi prevailed, causing people's illnesses to become increasingly alarming and filled with sorrow, while colds became severe and throats parched, leading to skin peeling and drying out</p> <p>9: \u662f\u6545\u536f\u9149\u4e4b\u5e74\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u571f\u7a92\u5929\u5167\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u53c8\u9047\u967d\u660e\u672a\u9077\u6b63\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u592a\u967d\u672a\u5347\u5929\u4e5f\uff0c\u571f\u904b\u4ee5\u81f3\u3002\u6c34\u6b32\u5347\u5929\uff0c\u571f\u904b\u6291\u4e4b\uff0c\u5347\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u5373\u6ebc\u800c\u71b1\u84b8\uff0c\u5bd2\u751f\u96e8\u9592\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u6ce8\u4e0d\uff0c\u98df\u4e0d\u53ca\u5316\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u6210\u9b31\uff0c\u51b7\u4f86\u5ba2\u71b1\uff0c\u51b0\u96f9\u5352\u81f3\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u53a5\u9006\u800c\u5666\uff0c\u71b1\u751f\u65bc\u5167\uff0c\u6c23\u75f9\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u8db3\u811b\u75e0\u75bc\uff0c\u53cd\u751f\u5fc3\u60b8\u61ca\u71b1\uff0c\u66b4\u7169\u800c\u5fa9\u53a5\u3002 Therefore, in the year of J\u012bny\u00edn (Punishment and Completion), when the sun ascends to heaven, the earth is sealed within, and it is victorious but cannot advance further. It encounters Y\u00e1ngm\u00edng (Brilliance without Falsehood) before moving to its proper place, which is when the sun has not yet risen to heaven and earth, with the earth running its course. Water tries to rise to heaven, but the earth suppresses it so it cannot advance further; it then becomes damp and hot, cold and rainy. People suffer from fevers that don't subside, and their food is not properly transformed. Over time, this leads to melancholy, with cold bringing out heat and hailstorms becoming severe. People suffer from severe fevers, and the heat generates internal discomfort while blocking external movement; they have pain in their ankles, and their hearts are restless and troubled by guilt, causing a sudden fever that is difficult to cure.</p> <p>10: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5347\u4e4b\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u76e1\u77e5\u5176\u65e8\u3002\u9858\u805e\u964d\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u660e\u4e4e\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\uff01\u662f\u4e4b\u8b02\u5929\u5730\u5fae\u65e8\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76e1\u9673\u65af\u9053\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u5347\u5df2\u964d\u4e5f\u3002\u81f3\u5929\u4e09\u5e74\uff0c\u6b21\u6b72\u5fc5\u964d\uff0c\u964d\u800c\u5165\u5730\uff0c\u59cb\u70ba\u5de6\u9592\u4e5f\u3002\u5982\u6b64\u5347\u964d\u5f80\u4f86\uff0c\u547d\u4e4b\u516d\u7d00\u8005\u77e3\u3002\u662f\u6545\u4e11\u672a\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u964d\u5730\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5730\u769b\uff0c\u52dd\u800c\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u5c11\u9670\u672a\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u53a5\u9670\u672a\u964d\u4e0b\uff0c\u91d1\u904b\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e2d\u3002\u91d1\u904b\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u964d\u4e4b\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u6291\u4e4b\u8b8a\u9b31\uff0c\u6728\u6b32\u964d\u4e0b\uff0c\u91d1\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u964d\u800c\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u84bc\u57c3\u9060\u898b\uff0c\u767d\u6c23\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u98a8\u8209\u57c3\u660f\uff0c\u6e05\u8e81\u884c\u6bba\uff0c\u971c\u9732\u5fa9\u4e0b\uff0c\u8085\u6bba\u5e03\u4ee4\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u6291\u4e4b\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u5373\u4f5c\u98a8\u8e81\u76f8\u4f0f\uff0c\u6684\u800c\u53cd\u6e05\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u840c\u52d5\uff0c\u6bba\u971c\u4e43\uff0c\u87c4\u672a\u898b\uff0c\u61fc\u6e05\u50b7\u85cf\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: The ascent is not immediate, and I have already fully understood its intention. Is it possible to hear about the descent that does not come down? Duke of Zhou said: Indeed, you are asking about it! This refers to the subtle intention of heaven and earth, which can be fully explained in this way, and it is called ascending and descending. After three years in heaven, it must descend each year. When it enters the land, it becomes the first yin, and when it does not advance, it is called the left idle period. The cycle of rising and falling goes back and forth, making six records. Therefore, in the years of chen and si, the great yin descends to the earth, controlling the apertures of the earth and winning without advancing. It may also encounter a small yang that has not yet retreated, and if the great yin does not descend, the golden rune will be right in the middle. The golden rune bears it, and the descent is not immediate, suppressing it and causing huidun to turn into chaos. Wood may try to descend, gold bears it and prevents it from descending, and the blue dust is far away, white qi bearing it, the wind raises the dust and makes it hazy, clear and lively, frost and dew fall again, and hide the slaying mandate. If it does not descend for a long time, it suppresses it into chaos, and then becomes wind and chaos, piercing and hiding, suddenly becoming clear, grass and trees stir, killing the frost, and seeing no insects, fearing the clear danger and hiding.</p> <p>11: \u662f\u6545\u5bc5\u7533\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u964d\u5730\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5730\u7384\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5165\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u4e19\u7533\u4e19\u5bc5\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5148\u5929\u800c\u81f3\u3002\u541b\u706b\u6b32\u964d\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u964d\u800c\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u5f64\u96f2\u7e94\u898b\uff0c\u9ed1\u6c23\u53cd\u751f\uff0c\u6684\u6696\u5982\u8212\uff0c\u5bd2\u5e38\u5e03\u96ea\uff0c\u51dc\u51bd\u5fa9\u4f5c\uff0c\u5929\u96f2\u6158\u60bd\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u4f0f\u4e4b\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u5bd2\u52dd\u5fa9\u71b1\uff0c\u8d64\u98a8\u5316\u75ab\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u9762\u8d64\u5fc3\u7169\uff0c\u982d\u75db\u76ee\u7729\u4e5f\uff0c\u8d64\u6c23\u5f70\u800c\u6eab\u75c5\u6b32\u4f5c\u4e5f\u3002 Therefore, in the year of Tian Shen, there is an insufficient Yin energy, ruling the constrained Yin Xuan, and it triumphs without reaching its goal. It may also encounter Jing Shen and Bing Shen, with water transport being too abundant, leading to premature arrival. When fire wants to descend, water supports it, but it does not fall until just after the dark clouds appear, black energy rebounds, the warmth suddenly expands like a breeze, cold always spreads snow, and the chill creates more of it. If it doesn't descend for a long time, it will secrete Ao, with cold victory leading to heat, red wind turning into disease, the people becoming ill, with their faces flushed and hearts disturbed; headaches and dizziness also occur, as the red energy is prominent and feverish diseases are about to break out.</p> <p>12: \u662f\u6545\u536f\u9149\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u964d\u5730\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5730\u84bc\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5165\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u5c11\u967d\u672a\u9000\u4f4d\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u592a\u9670\u672a\u5f97\u964d\u4e5f\uff0c\u6216\u6728\u904b\u4ee5\u81f3\u3002\u6728\u904b\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u964d\u800c\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u9ec3\u96f2\u898b\u800c\u9752\u971e\u5f70\uff0c\u9b31\u84b8\u4f5c\u800c\u5927\u98a8\uff0c\u9727\u7ff3\u57c3\u52dd\uff0c\u6298\u640d\u8ffa\u4f5c\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\u4e5f\uff0c\u4f0f\u4e4b\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u5929\u57c3\u9ec3\u6c23\uff0c\u5730\u5e03\u6ebc\u84b8\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u56db\u80a2\u4e0d\u8209\uff0c\u660f\u7729\u80a2\u7bc0\u75db\uff0c\u8179\u6eff\u586b\u81c6\u3002 Therefore, in the year of the Yin Earth Rooster (60 years later than the sexagenary cycle), the Yin prevailed and controlled the Lung, resulting in a dry and weakened state. However, this was not effective. Alternatively, if the Yang was still insufficient or not yet fully developed, it could not defeat the Yin either; this is the phase of Wood's dominance. When the Wood phase takes over, it descends without manifesting clearly, and one may see hazy blue clouds and distinct white mists. Drizzling rain and fog prevail, with branches and leaves being bent or broken. If this phase persists but does not descend, it will suppress the Yin, allowing yellow dust to spread in the sky and damp steam to cover the earth. The people will be afflicted with diseases affecting their limbs, causing dizziness, pain in joints, weakness in the waist, and abdominal distention.</p> <p>13: \u662f\u6545\u8fb0\u620a\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u964d\u5730\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5730\u7384\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5165\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u6c34\u904b\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5148\u5929\u800c\u81f3\u4e5f\u3002\u6c34\u904b\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c34\u964d\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u5f64\u96f2\u7e94\u898b\uff0c\u9ed1\u6c23\u53cd\u751f\uff0c\u6684\u6696\u6b32\u751f\uff0c\u51b7\u6c23\u5352\u81f3\uff0c\u751a\u5373\u51b0\u96f9\u4e5f\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u4f0f\u4e4b\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u51b7\u6c23\u5fa9\u71b1\uff0c\u8d64\u98a8\u5316\u75ab\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u9762\u8d64\u5fc3\u7169\uff0c\u982d\u75db\u76ee\u7729\u4e5f\uff0c\u8d64\u6c23\u5f70\u800c\u71b1\u75c5\u6b32\u4f5c\u4e5f\u3002 Therefore, in the year of Jia-shen (Chen-Wu), the Shao-yang (Minister) descended to the Earth and controlled the Yin of Xuan. This was victorious but did not enter. Alternatively, it may encounter water energy that is too excessive, leading to death before arrival. The water energy carries it, and water does not descend; as soon as the dark clouds appear, black gas rebounds, heating tends to arise, cold air becomes extreme, and it will immediately become hailstones. If it does not descend for a long time, it will hide as Tian (ice), cold air will be heated again, red wind will transform into epidemic diseases; people's hearts will be hot and restless, with headaches and dizziness, and the ardent Yang Qi is about to give rise to febrile diseases.</p> <p>14: \u662f\u6545\u5df1\u4ea5\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u964d\u5730\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5730\u5f64\uff0c\u52dd\u800c\u4e0d\u5165\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u592a\u9670\u672a\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u5c11\u967d\u672a\u5f97\u964d\uff0c\u5373\u706b\u904b\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e4b\u3002\u706b\u904b\u627f\u4e4b\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u6e05\u800c\u8085\uff0c\u8d64\u6c23\u8ffa\u5f70\uff0c\u6684\u71b1\u53cd\u4f5c\u3002\u6c11\u7686\u65e8\u5026\uff0c\u591c\u81e5\u4e0d\u5b89\uff0c\u54bd\u4e7e\u5f15\u98f2\uff0c\u61ca\u71b1\u5167\u7169\uff0c\u5927\u6e05\u671d\u66ae\uff0c\u6684\u9084\u5fa9\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u4f0f\u4e4b\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u5929\u6e05\u8584\u5bd2\uff0c\u9060\u751f\u767d\u6c23\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u6389\u7729\uff0c\u624b\u8db3\u76f4\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec1\uff0c\u5169\u8105\u4f5c\u75db\uff0c\u6eff\u76ee\u5fd9\u5fd9\u3002 Therefore, in the year of J\u00ed H\u00e0i, the Yang M\u00edng descended (to earth), ruling and subduing the orifices, but did not enter. Alternatively, when encountering the retreating Q\u012b Y\u01d0n, and the Sh\u01ceo Y\u00e1ng had yet to descend, it was because of the Fire Stem reaching its height. The Fire Stem being in control, the sky became clear and calm, with fiery qi bursting forth, producing intense heat. The people were exhausted, unable to sleep at night, their throats dry and parched, tormented by internal heat, becoming delirious during the day and night, with the heat still producing discomfort after a while, it was hidden and turned into melancholy, the sky became cold and distant, and white qi began to emerge. The people fell ill, suffering from dizziness, their limbs stiff and unresponsive, pain in both arms, blurry vision, and a state of constant restlessness.</p> <p>15: \u662f\u6545\u5b50\u5348\u4e4b\u5e74\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u964d\u5730\uff0c\u4e3b\u7a92\u5730\u961c\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u964d\u800c\u4e0d\u5165\u3002\u53c8\u6216\u9047\u571f\u904b\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5148\u5929\u800c\u81f3\u3002\u571f\u904b\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u964d\u800c\u4e0d\u5165\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u5f70\u9ed1\u6c23\uff0c\u669d\u6697\u60bd\u6158\uff0c\u7e94\u65bd\u9ec3\u57c3\u800c\u5e03\u6ebc\uff0c\u5bd2\u5316\u4ee4\u6c23\uff0c\u84b8\u6ebc\u5fa9\u4ee4\u3002\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u4f0f\u4e4b\u5316\u9b31\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u5927\u53a5\uff0c\u56db\u80a2\u91cd\u6020\uff0c\u9670\u75ff\u5c11\u529b\uff0c\u5929\u5e03\u6c88\u9670\uff0c\u84b8\u6ebc\u9592\u4f5c\u3002 During the year of Ziwei, the sun fell upon the earth, and the Duke of Ding conquered the state of Zhou, but did not enter it. Alternatively, if the Grand Exalt met with an excess of Earth, he arrived early. The Earth received this, and he did not enter, at which time the sky was dark and gloomy; the sun shone on the yellow dust and spread it, causing the cold to become humid again, with the moisture condensing. If it did not rain for a long time, it became hidden in the fog, and the people suffered great diseases, their limbs being heavy and sluggish, and their virility reduced and strength weakened; the sky covered in dark yin, and the sun's heat produced idle work.</p> <p>16: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5347\u964d\u4e0d\u524d\uff0c\u6670\u5982\u5176\u5b97\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u660e\u4e4e\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b63\u53f8\u4e2d\u4f4d\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u9077\u6b63\u4f4d\uff0c\u53f8\u5929\u4e0d\u5f97\u5176\u9077\u6b63\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u524d\u53f8\u5929\u4ee5\u904e\u4ea4\u53f8\u4e4b\u3002\u5373\u9047\u53f8\u5929\u592a\u904e\u6709\u9918\u65e5\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u4ecd\u820a\u6cbb\u5929\u6578\uff0c\u65b0\u53f8\u5929\u672a\u5f97\u9077\u6b63\u4e5f\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u5373\u98a8\u6684\u4e0d\u6642\uff0c\u82b1\u5349\u840e\u7601\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u6dcb\u6eb2\uff0c\u76ee\u7cfb\u8f49\uff0c\u8f49\u7b4b\u559c\u6012\uff0c\u5c0f\u4fbf\u8d64\u3002\u98a8\u6b32\u4ee4\u800c\u5bd2\u7531\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u6eab\u6684\u4e0d\u6b63\uff0c\u6625\u6b63\u5931\u6642\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u5373\u51b7\u6c23\u4e0d\u9000\uff0c\u6625\u51b7\u5f8c\u5bd2\uff0c\u6684\u6696\u4e0d\u6642\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u56db\u80a2\u7169\u75db\uff0c\u8170\u810a\u5f37\u76f4\u3002\u6728\u6c23\u96d6\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e0d\u904e\u65bc\u541b\u706b\u4e5f\u3002\u592a\u9670\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u5373\u96f2\u96e8\u5931\u4ee4\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u67af\u7126\uff0c\u7576\u751f\u4e0d\u767c\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u624b\u8db3\u80a2\u7bc0\u816b\u6eff\uff0c\u5927\u8179\u6c34\u816b\uff0c\u586b\u81c6\u4e0d\u98df\uff0c\u98e7\u6cc4\u8105\u6eff\uff0c\u56db\u80a2\u4e0d\u8209\u3002\u96e8\u5316\u6b32\u4ee4\uff0c\u71b1\u7336\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u6eab\u7166\u65bc\u6c23\uff0c\u4ea2\u800c\u4e0d\u6fa4\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u5373\u708e\u707c\u5f17\u4ee4\uff0c\u82d7\u83a0\u4e0d\u69ae\uff0c\u9177\u6691\u65bc\u79cb\uff0c\u8085\u6bba\u665a\u81f3\uff0c\u971c\u9732\u4e0d\u6642\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u3fac\u7627\u9aa8\u71b1\uff0c\u5fc3\u60b8\u9a5a\u99ed\uff0c\u751a\u6642\u8840\u6ea2\u3002\u967d\u660e\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u5247\u6691\u5316\u65bc\u524d\uff0c\u8085\u65bc\u5f8c\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u53cd\u69ae\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u5bd2\u71b1\u9f3d\u568f\uff0c\u76ae\u6bdb\u6298\uff0c\u722a\u7532\u67af\u71cb\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u5598\u55fd\u606f\u9ad8\uff0c\u60b2\u50b7\u4e0d\u6a02\u3002\u71b1\u5316\u4e43\u5e03\uff0c\u71e5\u5316\u672a\u4ee4\uff0c\u5373\u6e05\u52c1\u672a\u884c\uff0c\u80ba\u91d1\u5fa9\u75c5\u3002\u592a\u967d\u4e0d\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u5373\u51ac\u6e05\u53cd\u5bd2\uff0c\u6613\u4ee4\u65bc\u6625\uff0c\u6bba\u971c\u5728\u524d\uff0c\u5bd2\u51b0\u65bc\u5f8c\uff0c\u967d\u5149\u5fa9\u6cbb\uff0c\u51dc\u51bd\u4e0d\u4f5c\uff0c\u96f0\u96f2\u5f85\u6642\u3002\u6c11\u75c5\u6eab\u7658\u81f3\uff0c\u5589\u9589\u6ea2\u4e7e\uff0c\u7169\u71e5\u800c\u6e34\uff0c\u5598\u606f\u800c\u6709\u97f3\u4e5f\u3002\u5bd2\u5316\u5f85\u71e5\uff0c\u7336\u6cbb\u5929\uff0c\u6c23\u904e\u5931\u5e8f\uff0c\u8207\u6c11\u4f5c\u707d\u3002 The emperor asked: Why doesn't the qi of ascending and descending change, and why does it seem like this? I wish to hear about the correcting [of the qi], can it be understood clearly? </p> <p>Duke of Zhou replied: The position of correcting [the qi] is referred to as adjusting the correct. In regulating heaven, if one cannot adjust the correct, then it is because one has passed over regulating heaven and exceeded the proper balance. This results in a lack of regulation in governing heaven, and not being able to adjust the correct for heaven. </p> <p>If yin does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely winds, flowers and plants wither, people get sick from dampness, and the stars move irregularly, causing stiff joints that feel joy or anger. </p> <p>Winds may cause cold but it doesn't go away, and the sun is not regulated so the season is out of time. </p> <p>If yang shaoye does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely winds, clouds and rain are not timely, and all things wither. People get sick with swollen joints, edema, bloated bellies, unable to eat, and diarrhea that threatens their lives, while feverish winds do not go away. </p> <p>If shaoyin does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely rain and clouds so everything dries up and doesn't grow. People get sick with swollen joints, edema, bloated bellies, unable to eat, and diarrhea that threatens their lives, while feverish winds do not go away. </p> <p>If jueyin does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely rain and clouds so everything dries up and doesn't grow. People get sick with chills and fever, their hearts are disturbed and afraid, and it is a critical time for bleeding. </p> <p>If yangming does not adjust the correct, heat will come too early, while cold comes later. Grasses and trees become damaged, people get sick with chills and fevers, hair and skin dry up, nails become brittle, and in severe cases, there is wheezing and high-pitched breathing while unable to find joy. </p> <p>Heat becomes a disaster, while dryness does not go away, so the lungs' qi does not circulate, and j\u012bn (metal) becomes sick again. </p> <p>If taiyang does not adjust the correct, there will be untimely cold in winter, easy to cause frostbite, and cold ice lingers longer after winter, causing y\u00e1ng (sunlight) to fail to regulate. People get sick with warmth rashes, chills, throats that close up and become dry, they feel irritated and thirsty while wheezing and having high-pitched breathing. </p> <p>Cold becomes a disaster, as if regulating heaven, but the qi goes over the proper balance, causing harm to people.</p> <p>17: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9077\u6b63\u65e9\u665a\uff0c\u4ee5\u547d\u5176\u65e8\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u660e\u54c9\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6240\u8b02\u4e0d\u9000\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u6578\u672a\u7d42\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u6578\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5fa9\u5e03\u653f\uff0c\u6545\u540d\u66f0\u518d\u6cbb\u5929\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u4ee4\u5982\u6545\u800c\u4e0d\u9000\u4f4d\u4e5f\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u4e0d\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u5927\u98a8\u65e9\u8209\uff0c\u6642\u96e8\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u6ebc\u4ee4\u4e0d\u5316\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u6eab\u75ab\uff0c\u75b5\u5ee2\u98a8\u751f\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u7686\u80a2\u7bc0\u75db\uff0c\u982d\u76ee\u75db\uff0c\u4f0f\u71b1\u5167\u7169\uff0c\u54bd\u5589\u4e7e\u5f15\u98f2\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u4e0d\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u6eab\u751f\u6625\u51ac\uff0c\u87c4\u87f2\u65e9\u81f3\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u767c\u751f\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u8188\u71b1\u54bd\u4e7e\uff0c\u8840\u6ea2\u9a5a\u99ed\uff0c\u5c0f\u4fbf\u8d64\u6f80\uff0c\u4e39\u7624\u75b9\u7621\u760d\u7559\u6bd2\u3002\u592a\u9670\u4e0d\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u53d6\u5bd2\u6691\u4e0d\u6642\uff0c\u57c3\u660f\u5e03\u4f5c\uff0c\u6eab\u4ee4\u4e0d\u53bb\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u56db\u652f\u5c11\u529b\uff0c\u98df\u98f2\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u6cc4\u6ce8\u6dcb\u6eff\uff0c\u8db3\u811b\u5bd2\uff0c\u9670\u75ff\u9589\u585e\uff0c\u5931\u6eba\u5c0f\u4fbf\u6578\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u4e0d\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u71b1\u751f\u65bc\u6625\uff0c\u6691\u8ffa\u5f8c\u5316\uff0c\u51ac\u6eab\u4e0d\u51cd\uff0c\u6d41\u6c34\u4e0d\u51b0\uff0c\u87c4\u87f2\u51fa\u898b\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u5c11\u6c23\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u66f4\u4f5c\uff0c\u4fbf\u8840\u4e0a\u71b1\uff0c\u5c0f\u8179\u5805\u6eff\uff0c\u5c0f\u4fbf\u8d64\u6c83\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u8840\u6ea2\u3002\u967d\u660e\u4e0d\u9000\u4f4d\uff0c\u5373\u6625\u751f\u6e05\u51b7\uff0c\u8349\u6728\u665a\u69ae\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u9592\u4f5c\uff0c\u6c11\u75c5\u5614\u5410\u66b4\u6ce8\uff0c\u98df\u98f2\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u4fbf\u4e7e\u71e5\uff0c\u56db\u80a2\u4e0d\u8209\uff0c\u76ee\u7791\u6389\u7729\u3002 The emperor said: When should I ascend the throne? It is a matter of life and death. May I know if it is appropriate to abdicate now, and can it be clearly understood? The Duke of Shou replied: The one who does not abdicate means that the days are not yet complete, and there is still time remaining. This is called 'restoring the canopy' and 'reordering Heaven.' It means to continue the decree as before without abdicating. If the left yang does not abdicate, it means early north winds will arise, rain will not fall, the flooding will not subside, and the people will suffer from summer and autumn fevers. The diseases will all be joint pain, headaches, feverish internal discomfort, sore throats, and dry throats that impede drinking. If the right yin does not abdicate, it means that warm weather will arise in spring and autumn, insects will arrive early, plants will sprout, and people will suffer from abdominal heat and sore throat, bloody secretions will be agitated, urine will be red and turbid, and toxic sores and lesions will remain. If the yin does not abdicate, it means that cold and heat will change unpredictably, dizziness and confusion will arise, the cold will not disperse, and people will suffer from weak limbs, their food and drink will not go down, they will have incontinence and be drenched, their soles and heels will be cold, and their essence will be wasted, causing difficulty in urinating. If the lesser yang does not abdicate, it means that heat will arise in spring, summer will follow quickly, winter warmth will not freeze, and water will not freeze, insects will appear, people will suffer from weakness of the spirit, alternating cold and heat, feverish blood will rise, the lower abdomen will be hard and distended, and urine will be red and wet. If the primordial yang does not abdicate, it means that in spring there will be clear and cold weather, plants will wither late, cold and heat will alternate, and people will suffer from vomiting and severe diarrhea, their food and drink will not go down, their limbs will not move, and their eyes will blink and wander.</p> <p>18: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u6b72\u65e9\u665a\uff0c\u4f59\u4ee5\u77e5\u4e4b\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5730\u6578\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u9592\u4e4e\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5730\u4e0b\u9077\u6b63\u5347\u53ca\u9000\u4f4d\u4e0d\u524d\u4e4b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5730\u571f\u7522\u5316\uff0c\u842c\u7269\u5931\u6642\u4e4b\u5316\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said: Heaven's rise and set, I know of them.

They govern the cycle of the universe. When the celestial bodies move up and down along their ecliptic, sometimes they lose their positions, can this be seen clearly? Duke Zhou replied: Those who fail to maintain their positions are those who may have mastered the solar terms, but have not grasped the timing of the celestial bodies. This results in the four seasons being out of order and brings about a great plague. The note from the Xuanzangmiyu states: The years governed by yang last thirty years, with six exception years, making it a total of twenty-four overly long years. Subtracting these six exception years, they all serve to demonstrate the intention of avoiding the undesirable result. Now if we talk about iterations of the ten stems and twelve branches, this can also be applied in the same way.</p> <p>20: \u5047\u4ee4\u7532\u5b50\u967d\u5e74\uff0c\u571f\u904b\u592a\u7a92\uff0c\u5982\u7678\u4ea5\u5929\u6578\u6709\u9918\u8005\uff0c\u5e74\u96d6\u4ea4\u5f97\u7532\u5b50\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u7336\u5c1a\u6cbb\u5929\uff0c\u5730\u5df2\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u5728\u6cc9\uff0c\u53bb\u6b72\u5c11\u967d\u4ee5\u4f5c\u53f3\u9592\uff0c\u5373\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u5730\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u76f8\u548c\u5949\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u7678\u5df3\u76f8\u6703\uff0c\u571f\u904b\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u865b\u53cd\u53d7\u6728\u52dd\uff0c\u6545\u975e\u592a\u904e\u4e5f\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u8a00\u571f\u904b\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u6cc1\u9ec3\u9418\u4e0d\u61c9\u592a\u7a92\uff0c\u6728\u65e2\u52dd\u800c\u91d1\u9084\u5fa9\uff0c\u91d1\u65e2\u5fa9\u800c\u5c11\u9670\u5982\u81f3\uff0c\u65e2\u6728\u52dd\u5982\u706b\u800c\u91d1\u5fa9\u5fae\uff0c\u5982\u6b64\u5247\u7532\u5df1\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u5316\u6210\u571f\u75ab\uff0c\u665a\u81f3\u65bc\u536f\uff0c\u65e9\u81f3\u4e19\u5bc5\uff0c\u571f\u75ab\u81f3\u4e5f\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u5584\u60e1\uff0c\u63a8\u5176\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u8a73\u4e4e\u592a\u4e00\u3002\u53c8\u53ea\u5982\u7532\u5b50\u5e74\uff0c\u5982\u7532\u81f3\u5b50\u800c\u5408\uff0c\u61c9\u4ea4\u53f8\u800c\u6cbb\u5929\uff0c\u5373\u4e0b\u5df1\u672a\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u620a\u5bc5\u5c11\u967d\u672a\u9000\u4f4d\u8005\uff0c\u4ea6\u7532\u5df1\u4e0b\u6709\u5408\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u571f\u904b\u975e\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u800c\u6728\u4e43\u4e58\u865b\u800c\u52dd\u571f\u4e5f\uff0c\u91d1\u6b21\u53c8\u884c\u5fa9\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5373\u53cd\u90aa\u5316\u4e5f\u3002\u9670\u967d\u5929\u5730\u6b8a\u7570\u723e\uff0c\u6545\u5176\u5927\u5c0f\u5584\u60e1\uff0c\u4e00\u5982\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u6cd5\u65e8\u4e5f\u3002 Assuming that the year is a Yang year, and there is excess in the Earth branch, even if it is Geng-yin, the year still changes to Jia-zi. The Yin [Earth] will continue to govern Heaven, but the Earth has already been corrected, and the Sun is at the Spring Point, with the deficient Yang of last year used to make a right vacancy. Thus, it is not surprising that the Yin [Earth] and the Sun [Yang] do not harmonize. When Jia-yin meets Geng-xu, there is too much Earth, and Wood overcomes Vacuity. This is not because there is too much Earth; how can one say that there is too much Earth when the Yellow Bell does not respond to excess? Wood then triumphs over Earth, followed by Metal rebounding and prevailing in its turn. Next, Metal prevails slightly, as if Wood were Fire, and Metal diminishes further. Thus, Jia-yi loses its protection, and the following three years turn into an Earth sickness. It arrives at Ren-wu and first appears in Si-si, becoming a general illness of Earth. Both large and small events, good and evil, can be explained by Heaven and Earth's principles.</p> <p>If one takes the year as Jia-zi, when Jia and Zi meet and unite, they should exchange and govern Heaven. Now, Geng-yin has not yet been corrected, and Wu-yin is still deficient without retreating from its position; thus, there is a meeting between Jia and Yi. The year is not too much Earth, but Wood triumphs over Vacuity by virtue of this excess. Metal then prevails again, leading to reverse transformation.</p> <p>The principles of Yin-Yang in Heaven and Earth are extremely different from what you say; thus, the large and small events, good and evil, follow the intention of Heaven and Earth's laws.</p> <p>21: \u5047\u4ee4\u4e19\u5bc5\u967d\u5e74\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5982\u4e59\u4e11\u5929\u6578\u6709\u9918\u8005\uff0c\u96d6\u4ea4\u5f97\u4e19\u5bc5\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u5c1a\u6cbb\u5929\u4e5f\uff0c\u5730\u5df2\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u53f8\u5730\uff0c\u53bb\u6b72\u592a\u967d\u4ee5\u4f5c\u53f3\u9592\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u592a\u9670\u800c\u5730\u53a5\uff0c\u6545\u5730\u4e0d\u5949\u5929\u5316\u4e5f\u3002\u4e59\u8f9b\u76f8\u6703\uff0c\u6c34\u904b\u592a\u865b\uff0c\u53cd\u53d7\u571f\u52dd\uff0c\u6545\u975e\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5373\u592a\u7c07\u4e4b\u7ba1\uff0c\u592a\u7fbd\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u571f\u52dd\u800c\u96e8\u5316\uff0c\u6c34\u5fa9\u5373\u98a8\uff0c\u6b64\u8005\u4e19\u8f9b\u5931\u5b88\u5176\u6703\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u5316\u6210\u6c34\u75ab\uff0c\u665a\u81f3\u5df1\u5df3\uff0c\u65e9\u81f3\u620a\u8fb0\uff0c\u751a\u5373\u901f\uff0c\u5fae\u5373\u5f90\uff0c\u6c34\u75ab\u81f3\u4e5f\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u5584\u60e1\u63a8\u5176\u5929\u5730\u6578\uff0c\u4e43\u592a\u4e59\u6e38\u5bae\u3002\u53c8\u53ea\u4e19\u5bc5\u5e74\uff0c\u4e19\u81f3\u5bc5\u4e14\u5408\uff0c\u61c9\u4ea4\u53f8\u800c\u6cbb\u5929\uff0c\u5373\u8f9b\u5df3\u672a\u5f97\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u5e9a\u8fb0\u592a\u967d\u672a\u9000\u4f4d\u8005\uff0c\u4ea6\u4e19\u8f9b\u4e0d\u5408\u5fb7\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u6c34\u904b\u4ea6\u5c0f\u865b\u800c\u5c0f\u52dd\uff0c\u6216\u6709\u5fa9\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u5316\u7658\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u6c34\u7658\uff0c\u5176\u72c0\u5982\u6c34\u75ab\uff0c\u6cbb\u6cd5\u5982\u524d\u3002 Assuming that the year of the Yang is too long, and if the number of Yin years has not yet passed, even though there is a mutual hour of Yang, the Yin still governs the Heaven, and the Earth has already been rectified. The Department of Yin governs the Earth, removing the Solar Year to make the Right Excess, and immediately it becomes the Heavenly Yin and the Earthly Yin, so the Earth does not obey the Heavenly decree. When the Yin of Xin meets, the Water Resource is too weak, and suffers from the victory of the Earth, so it is not excessive, but rather belongs to the management of the Crown Prince, the Feathered Crow does not respond, and the Earth triumphs while the water changes into dew, the water again becomes wind, and this occurs in the year of Bing Xin when Bing Xin fails to attend their meeting. In the following three years, it becomes the water sickness, arriving at J\u01d0 S\u00ec early and T\u01d0 Ch\u00ean late, very fast and somewhat slow, and the water sickness comes into existence. Both small good and evil fortune can be attributed to the Heaven and Earth numbers, which are the Palace of Yin and Yin. Similarly, assuming a year of Bing Xu, Bing at Xin and merging together apply to govern Heaven and treat it as a trade, but Sh\u0113ng R\u00ec is not yet in its proper position, and in the following three years it becomes the water sickness. Its treatment law is the same as before.</p> <p>22: \u5047\u4ee4\u5e9a\u8fb0\u967d\u5e74\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5982\u5df1\u536f\u5929\u6578\u6709\u9918\u8005\uff0c\u96d6\u4ea4\u5e9a\u8fb0\u5e74\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u7336\u5c1a\u6cbb\u5929\uff0c\u5730\u4ee5\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u53f8\u5730\uff0c\u53bb\u6b72\u5c11\u9670\u4ee5\u4f5c\u53f3\u9592\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u967d\u660e\u800c\u5730\u592a\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u5730\u4e0b\u5949\u5929\u4e5f\u3002\u4e59\u5df3\u76f8\u6703\uff0c\u91d1\u904b\u592a\u865b\uff0c\u53cd\u53d7\u706b\u52dd\uff0c\u6545\u975e\u592a\u904e\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u59d1\u6d17\u4e4b\u7ba1\uff0c\u592a\u5546\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u706b\u52dd\u71b1\u5316\uff0c\u6c34\u5fa9\u5bd2\u5211\uff0c\u6b64\u4e59\u5e9a\u5931\u5b88\uff0c\u5176\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u5316\u6210\u91d1\u75ab\u4e5f\uff0c\u901f\u81f3\u58ec\u5348\uff0c\u5f90\u81f3\u7678\u672a\uff0c\u91d1\u75ab\u81f3\u4e5f\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u5584\u60e1\uff0c\u63a8\u672c\u5e74\u5929\u6578\u53ca\u592a\u4e00\u4e5f\u3002\u53c8\u53ea\u5982\u5e9a\u8fb0\uff0c\u5982\u5e9a\u81f3\u8fb0\uff0c\u4e14\u61c9\u4ea4\u53f8\u800c\u6cbb\u5929\uff0c\u5373\u4e0b\u4e59\u672a\u672a\u5f97\u9077\u6b63\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u5730\u7532\u5348\u5c11\u9670\u672a\u9000\u4f4d\u8005\uff0c\u4e14\u4e59\u5e9a\u4e0d\u5408\u5fb7\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u4e0b\u4e59\u672a\uff0c\u5e72\u5931\u525b\uff0c\u4ea6\u91d1\u904b\u5c0f\u865b\u4e5f\uff0c\u6709\u5c0f\u52dd\u6216\u7121\u5fa9\uff0c\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u5316\u7658\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u91d1\u7658\uff0c\u5176\u72c0\u5982\u91d1\u75ab\u4e5f\uff0c\u6cbb\u6cd5\u5982\u524d\u3002 Assuming the year of the Yang Fire (\u5e9a\u8fb0) is too strong, and if there are extra days in the Jupiter-Rabbit (\u5df1\u536f) year, even though it is a Yang-Fire year, the Yin and Yang are still balanced, causing the Earth to move to its proper position. The Yang is dominant above and the Yin governs below. If there is a deficiency of Yin in the previous year, this will result in an excess of Yin on the right side, with Heaven being dominated by Yin and Earth governed by Yin. This is why we say that the Earth serves Heaven. When Metal Ox (\u4e59\u5df3) meets, there is a deficiency of Metal, resulting in Fire being dominant. Therefore, this is not due to an excess. Like using a metal stick to manage a dog, and when Mercury fails to apply correctly, causing Fire to dominate and create heat, while Water produces cold punishment. This results in the failure of Jupiter-Roooster (\u5e9a\u536f) to maintain balance, leading to the development of a Metal sickness over the next three years. It gradually reaches its peak at the time of the Dragon (\u58ec\u5348), then slowly at the time of the Water Rat (\u7678\u672a), and the Metal sickness has fully manifested. Good and evil are influenced by the heavens, based on the number of days in the year and the Taiyi principle. Similarly, if it is like Yang-Fire (\u5e9a\u8fb0) year, and Jupiter-Rooster (\u4e59\u672a) year also applies and governs above, but the right position of Earth is not adjusted, and there is a lack of harmony between Jupiter-Rooster and Yang-Fire. This results in the failure of Jupiter-Ox (\u4e59\u5df3), with a Metal deficiency that is also small and insignificant. There is a possibility of a small victory or no effect at all, leading to the development of a Metal sore over the next three years. It is called Metal Sore, its state is similar to Metal sickness, and treatment is similar to the previous method.</p> <p>23: \u5047\u4ee4\u58ec\u5348\u967d\u5e74\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5982\u8f9b\u5df3\u5929\u6578\u6709\u9918\u8005\uff0c\u96d6\u4ea4\u5f8c\u58ec\u5348\u5e74\u4e5f\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u7336\u5c1a\u6cbb\u5929\uff0c\u5730\u5df3\u9077\u6b63\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u5728\u6cc9\uff0c\u53bb\u6b72\u4e19\u7533\u5c11\u967d\u4ee5\u4f5c\u53f3\u9592\uff0c\u5373\u5929\u53a5\u9670\u800c\u5730\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u6545\u5730\u4e0d\u5949\u5929\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u4e01\u8f9b\u76f8\u5408\u6703\uff0c\u6728\u904b\u592a\u865b\uff0c\u53cd\u53d7\u91d1\u52dd\uff0c\u6545\u975e\u592a\u904e\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u8564\u8cd3\u4e4b\u7ba1\uff0c\u592a\u89d2\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u91d1\u884c\u71e5\u52dd\uff0c\u706b\u5316\u71b1\u5fa9\u751a\u5373\u901f\uff0c\u5fae\u5373\u5f90\uff0c\u75ab\u81f3\u5927\u5c0f\u5584\u60e1\uff0c\u63a8\u75ab\u81f3\u4e4b\u5e74\u5929\u6578\u53ca\u592a\u4e00\u3002\u53c8\u53ea\u5982\u58ec\u81f3\u5348\uff0c\u4e14\u61c9\u4ea4\u53f8\u800c\u6cbb\u4e4b\uff0c\u5373\u4e0b\u4e01\u9149\u672a\u5f97\u9077\u6b63\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u5730\u4e0b\u4e19\u7533\u5c11\u967d\u672a\u5f97\u9000\u4f4d\u8005\uff0c\u898b\u4e01\u58ec\u4e0d\u5408\u5fb7\u4e5f\uff0c\u5373\u4e01\u67d4\u5e72\u5931\u525b\uff0c\u4ea6\u6728\u904b\u5c0f\u865b\u4e5f\uff0c\u6709\u5c0f\u52dd\u5c0f\u5fa9\u3002\u5f8c\u4e09\u5e74\u5316\u7658\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u6728\u7658\uff0c\u5176\u72c0\u5982\u98a8\u75ab\uff0c\u6cd5\u6cbb\u5982\u524d\u3002 If the reign of the Yin in the Jupiter year is too long, and if the number of days in the Solar term of Xin She has not yet ended, even though it later becomes the Ren Mao year, the Yin is still regulating heaven, while the Sun in Li Ch'ien is correctly positioned, and the Yang Ming is at the springs. The deficiency year is then followed by an excess year, resulting in a situation where heaven is dominated by Yin and earth by Yang Ming, so that earth does not obey heaven. When Metal and Fire meet, Wood is too vacuous, and suffers defeat to Earth, which therefore wins. This is not because of excess; it is simply the situation as represented by the trigram K'an (Man) and the hexagram Ta Ch'u, where the line in the top position does not change.</p> <p>The next year, Wood and Fire meet, but because Wood is vacuous, Fire wins. This results in a situation where heat is very intense and rapid, becoming moderated only gradually. The epidemic becomes severe or mild according to whether it occurs early or late in the year, and its onset can be predicted by counting the days of the Solar term in which the epidemic occurs. If we assume that it occurs during the Solar term Jupiter-Mao, we find that the appropriate procedure is to begin treatment at the first day of the month of Earth-Wu. This means that the Lesser Yin has not yet withdrawn its influence, and this is a situation where Metal and Wood are both lacking in strength.

Therefore, the earth did not follow the heavenly transformations. When D\u012bng and G\u0113ng meet, the fire stalk is too weak and receives the power of fire, which is why it's not excessive.

The celestial light will not converge, evil spirits will attack people, leading to premature death. Have you heard of this? Qi Bo replied: A person has five essences, one essence insufficiency leads to heavenly emptiness, which is the extreme susceptibility to evil spirits. When a person worries, mourns, and reflects, they hurt their heart, and may also encounter a shortage of yin governing heaven, which does not last long, causing heaven's emptiness. This is the same as the insufficiency of human vital energy and heavenly energy. Moreover, upon being startled, they lose their spirit, sweat flows from the heart, resulting in three forms of emptiness, and their soul and divine light lose their guardianship. The soul serves as the emperor's official, coming forth from the divine on high, the divine light loses its guardianship, and does not converge when it encounters a year without fire. Black corpses may appear and cause people to die violently. People's vital energy is damaged by overeating and tiredness, or they may encounter a shortage of yin governing heaven, which does not last long, causing the sun to become more prominent. Yellow corpse spirits may appear and cause violent deaths. Sitting for a long time in damp places can harm the kidneys, as the kidneys are the official in charge of strength and agility, coming forth from within. This results in three forms of emptiness, as the kidney spirit loses its guardianship, with the divine light not converging when it encounters a year without water. Green corpses may appear and cause violent deaths. People sometimes feel anger or sorrow, causing qi to flow counter to its proper direction, harming the liver. If there is an insufficiency of yin governing heaven, which does not last long, this is considered heavenly emptiness. This refers to both heavenly and human emptiness. Upon encountering panic and fear, sweat flows from the liver, as the liver is the general's official, coming forth with strategy. The divine light loses its guardianship, and the light does not converge when it encounters a year without wood. White corpses may appear and cause violent deaths. In conclusion, if a person loses the guardianship of the five spirits, this is heavenly emptiness and human emptiness. The divine light wanders without guardianship, leading to the attack by five corpse spirits, causing violent deaths. This is also known as the corpse evil. A person who loses the balance of the five spirits will not have a converging divine light, nor are only corpse evils the only danger. It means that those who lose the guardianship of position and die are doomed to destruction by the divine light, while those who maintain the divine light will live.</p>"},{"location":"74_huangdi-neijing_zhi-zhen-yao-da-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u81f3\u771f\u8981\u5927\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u6c23\u4ea4\u5408\uff0c\u76c8\u865b\u66f4\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f59\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\u516d\u6c23\u5206\u6cbb\uff0c\u53f8\u5929\u5730\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u81f3\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u518d\u62dc\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u660e\u4e4e\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\u3002\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u5927\u7d00\uff0c\u4eba\u795e\u4e4b\u901a\u61c9\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u4e0a\u5408\u662d\u662d\uff0c\u4e0b\u5408\u51a5\u51a5\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u9053\u4e4b\u6240\u4e3b\uff0c\u5de5\u4e4b\u6240\u7591\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53a5\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u4ee5\u98a8\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u4ee5\u71b1\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u4ee5\u6fd5\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u4ee5\u706b\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u4ee5\u71e5\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5176\u5316\u4ee5\u5bd2\uff0c\u4ee5\u6240\u81e8\u85cf\u4f4d\uff0c\u547d\u5176\u75c5\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5730\u5316\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53f8\u5929\u540c\u5019\uff0c\u9593\u6c23\u7686\u7136\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9593\u6c23\u4f55\u8b02\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53f8\u5de6\u53f3\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u9593\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u7570\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e3b\u6b72\u8005\u7d00\u6b72\uff0c\u9593\u6c23\u8005\u7d00\u6b65\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6b72\u4e3b\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53a5\u9670\u53f8\u5929\u70ba\u98a8\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6cc9\u70ba\u9178\u5316\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u70ba\u84bc\u5316\uff0c\u9592\u6c23\u70ba\u52d5\u5316\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u53f8\u5929\u70ba\u71b1\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6cc9\u70ba\u82e6\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u53f8\u6c23\u5316\uff0c\u5c45\u6c23\u70ba\u707c\u5316\u3002\u592a\u9670\u53f8\u5929\u70ba\u6fd5\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6cc9\u70ba\u7518\u5316\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u70ba\u9ec5\u5316\uff0c\u9592\u6c23\u70ba\u67d4\u5316\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u53f8\u5929\u70ba\u706b\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6cc9\u70ba\u82e6\u5316\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u70ba\u4e39\u5316\uff0c\u9593\u6c23\u70ba\u660e\u5316\u3002\u967d\u660e\u53f8\u5929\u70ba\u71e5\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6cc9\u70ba\u8f9b\u5316\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u70ba\u7d20\u5316\uff0c\u9593\u6c23\u70ba\u6e05\u5316\u3002\u592a\u967d\u53f8\u5929\u70ba\u5bd2\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6cc9\u70ba\u9e79\u5316\uff0c\u53f8\u6c23\u70ba\u7384\u5316\uff0c\u9593\u6c23\u70ba\u85cf\u5316\u3002\u6545\u6cbb\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u5fc5\u660e\u516d\u5316\u5206\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e94\u5473\u4e94\u8272\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u6240\u5b9c\uff0c\u8ffa\u53ef\u4ee5\u8a00\u76c8\u865b\u75c5\u751f\u4e4b\u7dd2\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor asked: When the five energies are unified, and yin and yang are further balanced, I am already aware of this. But how can the six energies be separated and governed, those who govern heaven and earth, how is it done? </p> <p>Huo Bo bowed again in response and said, It is truly a profound question. The order of heaven and the connection between humans and spirits are manifested through this. Emperor asked: I wish to hear about the great harmony above and the harmony below. Ho Bo replied: This path is what the wise follow, and what causes confusion for craftsmen. Emperor asked: I wish to hear about its way. </p> <p>Huo Bo said: The Excessive Yin governs heaven, its transformation manifests as wind; the Lesser Yin governs heaven, its transformation manifests as heat; the Yin of heaven governs heaven, its transformation manifests as dampness; the Shao Yang governs heaven, its transformation manifests as fire; the Yang Ming governs heaven, its transformation manifests as aridity; and the Greater Yang governs heaven, its transformation manifests as cold. Emperor asked: How about the transformation of earth? </p> <p>Huo Bo replied: The governance of heaven and earth is the same in terms of timing, and all intermediate energies are also timed accordingly. Emperor asked: What are these intermediate energies? Huo Bo replied: Those who govern left and right are referred to as intermediate energies. Emperor asked: How are they different? </p> <p>Huo Bo said: The Master of the season governs according to the season, and the intermediate energies govern according to steps. Emperor asked: That is good. How should one handle being the Master of the season? </p> <p>Huo Bo replied: The Excessive Yin governs heaven as wind, resides in the wells as an acidic influence; the Lesser Yin governs heaven as heat, does not reside in the wells but governs as a scorching influence; the Yin of heaven governs heaven as dampness, resides in the wells as a sweet influence; the Shao Yang governs heaven as fire, resides in the wells as a bright influence; the Yang Ming governs heaven as aridity, resides in the wells as a bitter influence; the Greater Yang governs heaven as cold, resides in the wells as a salty influence. Therefore, to treat diseases, one must clearly understand the six transformations and their divisions, and the flavors and colors that give rise to the five organs. This is already enough to describe the cause of yin and yang imbalance.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u53a5\u9670\u5728\u6cc9\u800c\u9178\u5316\uff0c\u5148\u4f59\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\u98a8\u5316\u4e4b\u884c\u4e5f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u98a8\u884c\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u672c\u4e5f\uff0c\u9918\u6c23\u540c\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u4e4e\u5929\u8005\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\u4e5f\uff0c\u672c\u4e4e\u5730\u8005\uff0c\u5730\u4e4b\u6c23\u4e5f\uff0c\u5929\u5730\u5408\u6c23\uff0c\u516d\u7bc0\u5206\u800c\u842c\u7269\u5316\u751f\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u8b39\u5019\u6c23\u5b9c\uff0c\u7121\u5931\u75c5\u6a5f\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u4e3b\u75c5\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53f8\u6b72\u5099\u7269\uff0c\u5247\u7121\u907a\u4e3b\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5148\u6b72\u7269\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u5c08\u7cbe\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u53f8\u6c23\u8005\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53f8\u6c23\u8005\u4e3b\u6b72\u540c\uff0c\u7136\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u975e\u53f8\u6b72\u7269\u4f55\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6563\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u8cea\u540c\u800c\u7570\u7b49\u4e5f\uff0c\u6c23\u5473\u6709\u8584\u539a\uff0c\u6027\u7528\u6709\u8e81\u975c\uff0c\u6cbb\u4fdd\u6709\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u529b\u5316\u6709\u6dfa\u6df1\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6b72\u4e3b\u85cf\u5bb3\u4f55\u8b02\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4ee5\u6240\u4e0d\u52dd\u547d\u4e4b\u5247\u5176\u8981\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u6deb\u4e8e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u52dd\u5e73\u4e4b\uff0c\u5916\u6deb\u4e8e\u5167\uff0c\u6240\u52dd\u6cbb\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5e73\u6c23\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8b39\u5bdf\u9670\u967d\u6240\u5728\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u70ba\u671f\uff0c\u6b63\u8005\u6b63\u6cbb\uff0c\u53cd\u8005\u53cd\u6cbb\u3002 The Emperor said: The Yin Qi is located at the source and becomes acidic. I have known this for a long time. What about the movement of the Qi in the transformation? Duke said: The Qi moves on the ground, which is the foundation, and the remaining Qi follows the same principle. Originating from heaven, it is heavenly Qi; originating from the earth, it is earthly Qi. When the Qi of heaven and earth are combined, they divide into six departments and give birth to myriad things. Therefore, it is said that being cautious about the Qi is appropriate, without missing any opportunities for recovery. The Emperor said: How does one deal with the illness? Duke said: Preparing for the season and stockpiling supplies will ensure there are no lingering diseases. The Emperor said: What are seasonal supplies? Duke said: They are the essence of heaven and earth. The Emperor said: How should I manage the Qi? Duke said: Managing the Qi is similar to managing the seasons, but it involves a surplus or deficit. The Emperor said: What does not managing the seasonal supplies mean? Duke said: Scattered, so although they have the same essence, they are different in degree, with flavors of thin and thick, uses of agitated and quiet, treatments with more or less, and transformations with shallow and deep, this is what he meant. The Emperor said: What does the seasonal lord hide? Duke said: It hides the things one cannot overcome by willpower. The Emperor said: How do I treat it? Duke said: Control the excess in the lower part, and control the treatment in the upper part, to restore balance. The Emperor said: Good. Balancing the Qi is what? Duke said: Cautiously observe the location of Yin and Yang and adjust them accordingly, with a goal of balancing.</p> <p>3: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u5bdf\u9670\u967d\u6240\u5728\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u8ad6\u8a00\u4eba\u8fce\u8207\u5bf8\u53e3\u76f8\u61c9\uff0c\u82e5\u5f15\u7e69\u5c0f\u5927\u9f4a\u7b49\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u5e73\uff0c\u9670\u4e4b\u6240\u5728\u5bf8\u53e3\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8996\u6b72\u5357\u5317\uff0c\u53ef\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5317\u653f\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u5728\u6cc9\uff0c\u5247\u5bf8\u53e3\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u5728\u6cc9\uff0c\u5247\u53f3\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u5728\u6cc9\uff0c\u5247\u5de6\u4e0d\u61c9\u3002\u5357\u653f\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5247\u5bf8\u53e3\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5247\u53f3\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u53f8\u5929\uff0c\u5247\u5de6\u4e0d\u61c9\u3002\u8af8\u4e0d\u61c9\u8005\uff0c\u53cd\u5176\u8a3a\u5247\u898b\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5c3a\u5019\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5317\u653f\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u5728\u4e0b\uff0c\u5247\u5bf8\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u5728\u4e0a\uff0c\u5247\u5c3a\u4e0d\u61c9\u3002\u5357\u653f\u4e4b\u6b72\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u5728\u5929\uff0c\u5247\u5bf8\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u5728\u6cc9\uff0c\u5247\u5c3a\u4e0d\u61c9\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u540c\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u77e5\u5176\u8981\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u8a00\u800c\u7d42\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5176\u8981\uff0c\u6d41\u6563\u7121\u7aae\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002 The emperor said: Zhongni spoke of understanding the location and adjusting yin and yang, discussing how speech meets response and corresponds with a single hair's breadth. If one extends the string big or small equally, he calls it level. Where is the location of yin? Boyi said: By observing the cycle of north and south, it can be known. The emperor said: I wish to hear more about this. Boyi said: In the season of northern politics, lesser yin is at the well, so the left should not respond; greater yin is at the well, so the right should not respond; greater yin is at the well, so the left should not respond. In the season of southern politics, lesser yin governs heaven, so the left should not respond; greater yin governs heaven, so the right should not respond; greater yin governs heaven, so the left should not respond. All the ones that should not respond can be seen by reversing their diagnosis. The emperor said: What about the foot measure? Boyi said: In the season of northern politics, three yin are below, so the left should not respond; three yin are above, so the foot measure should not respond. In the season of southern politics, three yin are in heaven, so the left should not respond; three yin are at the well, so the foot measure should not respond, as for left and right it is the same. Therefore, he said: Knowing its essence allows one to speak with brevity, while those who do not know its essence are scattered without end.

If Taiyin prevails during a year of excess, grasses and herbs will sprout early, dampness will prevail, causing the areas to become foggy, blackened, and visible, at the junctions of Yin, people will suffer from retained food and deafness, with flames flickering, red and sore, lower abdomen will ache and distend, they will not be able to urinate, heads will ache as if pulled, necks will ache like a limb that has been wrenched, waists will ache as if broken, thighs will not bend properly, butts will be knotted and hips will feel separated.  If Shaoyang prevails during a year of excess, flames will shine on the outskirts, chills and fevers will be more intense, people will suffer from bloody discharge and diarrhea, lower abdomen will ache and bleed, if it is extreme, there will be blood in their urine, Shaoyin and Shaoyang will both suffer.  Emperor: Good. How should they be treated?  Zhouyi replied: Regulate the Qi at its source, assist with bitter flavors, use sweet ones to calm, disperse with pungent, treat with acrid herbs. For excess internal heat, regulate with salty and cold, assist with sweet and bitter, clear with sour, release with bitter. For excess internal dampness, regulate with bitter and warm, assist with sour and astringent, dry with bitter, eliminate with astringent.

Emperor: Good. What is the nature of the changes in weather? Qi Bo: The Yin and Yang forces are out of balance, leading to various ailments. In the case of too much Yin, it leads to heat and drought, causing discomfort and illnesses such as heatstroke, joint pain, and skin rashes. In the case of too much Yang, it leads to excessive heat and fire, causing diseases such as fever, chills, and diarrhea. The treatment for these imbalances involves using herbs and acupuncture to restore balance between Yin and Yang, cooling or warming the body, and addressing specific symptoms.</p> <p>6: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u90aa\u6c23\u53cd\u52dd\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u98a8\u53f8\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u6e05\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u9178\u6eab\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u7518\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f9b\u5e73\u4e4b\u3002\u71b1\u53f8\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u5bd2\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u7518\u71b1\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u8f9b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9e79\u5e73\u4e4b\u3002\u6fd5\u53f8\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u71b1\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u82e6\u51b7\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u9e79\u7518\uff0c\u4ee5\u82e6\u5e73\u4e4b\u3002\u706b\u53f8\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u5bd2\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u7518\u71b1\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u8f9b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9e79\u5e73\u4e4b\u3002\u71e5\u53f8\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u71b1\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u5e73\u5bd2\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u7518\uff0c\u4ee5\u9178\u5e73\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u548c\u70ba\u5229\u3002\u5bd2\u53f8\u4e8e\u5730\uff0c\u71b1\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u9e79\u51b7\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u7518\u8f9b\uff0c\u4ee5\u82e6\u5e73\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u53f8\u5929\u90aa\u52dd\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u98a8\u5316\u65bc\u5929\uff0c\u6e05\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u9178\u6eab\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u7518\u82e6\u3002\u71b1\u5316\u65bc\u5929\uff0c\u5bd2\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u7518\u6eab\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u9178\u8f9b\u3002\u6fd5\u5316\u65bc\u5929\uff0c\u71b1\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u82e6\u5bd2\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u9178\u3002\u706b\u5316\u65bc\u5929\uff0c\u5bd2\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u7518\u71b1\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u8f9b\u3002\u71e5\u5316\u65bc\u5929\uff0c\u71b1\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u8f9b\u5bd2\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u7518\u3002\u5bd2\u5316\u65bc\u5929\uff0c\u71b1\u53cd\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6cbb\u4ee5\u9e79\u51b7\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u82e6\u8f9b\u3002 The Emperor said: Good. How about treating the evil qi that has gained the upper hand? Duke of Shou replied: If the pathogenic factor of wind dominates, it should be treated with acrid and warm herbs to dispel cold; accompanied by bitter and sweet herbs to harmonize the middle Jiao. If the pathogenic factor of heat dominates, it should be treated with sweet and warm herbs to disperse cold; accompanied by bitter and pungent herbs to purge the excess heat. If the pathogenic factor of dampness dominates, it should be treated with bitter and cold herbs to dispel heat; accompanied by salty and sweet herbs to harmonize the middle Jiao. If the pathogenic factor of fire dominates, it should be treated with sweet and warm herbs to disperse cold; accompanied by bitter and pungent herbs to purge the excess heat. If the pathogenic factor of dryness dominates, it should be treated with moderate cold and warm herbs to dispel heat; accompanied by bitter and sweet herbs to harmonize the middle Jiao. If the pathogenic factor of cold dominates, it should be treated with salty and cold herbs to disperse heat; accompanied by bitter and pungent herbs to purge the excess cold.

The emperor asked, What about the six qi conditions? Q Boya replied, Indeed, this is a difficult question. The deficiency of Yin leads to symptoms such as lower abdominal pain and cramping, acute pain and stabbing sensations in the chest, sweating and vomiting, loss of appetite, and food not entering the stomach, which then comes back out. This can lead to severe cases of affecting the spleen and causing distention and fullness in the abdomen. The Yang excess leads to internal heat, restlessness, lower abdominal pain, tongue symptoms, and mouth ulcers. There is excessive sweating, the skin feels itchy and painful, fever and thirst, body aches, and painful swelling of the limbs. Severe cases can lead to affecting the lungs and causing shortness of breath. The deficiency of Shao Yin leads to symptoms such as internal heat, restlessness, irritability, lower abdominal pain, red tongue with dry yellow coating, excessive sweating, and thirst. Severe cases can lead to affecting the kidneys and causing tinnitus. The excess of Tai Yang leads to symptoms such as internal heat and swelling, body aches, restlessness, irritability, inability to lie down, coughing with wheezing, nasal congestion, a red tongue with yellow coating, and thick sticky saliva. Severe cases can lead to affecting the lungs and causing cough with copious amounts of bloody sputum. The deficiency of Tai Yin leads to symptoms such as dampness and fullness in the body, difficulty digesting food and drinks, rising Yin to the head, hiccups accompanied by clear saliva, symptoms worsening during rainy days, skin lesions, severe headaches with dizziness, and vomiting of clear fluids. Severe cases can lead to affecting the bladder and causing incontinence of urine. The excess of Shao Yang leads to symptoms such as approaching internal heat, dryness and damage to the lips and tongue, restlessness and a feeling of suffocation, chest pain, heart palpitations, irritability, aversion to wind, rising Yin to the head, vomiting and clear saliva. Severe cases can lead to affecting the lungs and causing cough with blood-streaked sputum. The excess of Yang Ming leads to symptoms such as internal heat, fever, thirst, a red tongue with yellow coating, stomach pain and distention, headache, dizziness, difficulty eating, lower back and abdominal pain, leg cramps and restlessness, and thick sticky saliva. Severe cases can lead to affecting the liver and causing sudden jolts of pain. The emperor said, Good. How should one treat these conditions? Q Boya replied, For the deficiency of Yin, treatment involves using cool and cold herbs, supplemented by sweet and bitter herbs. To disperse, use cool and cold herbs; to tonify, use sweet and bitter herbs. For the deficiency of Shao Yin, treatment involves using cold and bitter herbs, supplemented by pungent and warm herbs. To disperse, use cold and bitter herbs; to tonify, use sour herbs; to promote sweating, use pungent and bitter herbs; to dry up dampness, use salty herbs. For the deficiency of Tai Yin, treatment involves using bitter and warm herbs, supplemented by sour and cool herbs. To disperse, use bitter and warm herbs; to dry up, use sour and cool herbs; to promote sweating, use pungent and bitter herbs; to tonify, use salty herbs. For the excess of Shao Yang, treatment involves using salty and cold herbs, supplemented by sweet and bitter herbs. To disperse, use salty and cold herbs; to dry up, use sweet and bitter herbs. For the excess of Tai Yang, treatment involves using bitter and warm herbs, supplemented by sour and cool herbs. To disperse, use bitter and warm herbs; to dry up, use sour and cool herbs; to promote sweating, use pungent and bitter herbs; to tonify, use salty herbs. For the excess of Yang Ming, treatment involves using warm and pungent herbs, supplemented by sweet and bitter herbs. To disperse, use warm and pungent herbs; to clear heat, use bitter and sweet herbs; to descend, use sour herbs. Treat each condition according to its specific symptoms, ensuring the qi is balanced, and the disease will resolve, returning to its source. \u300aClassic of Difficult Issues\u300b</p> <p>9: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1b\u5584\u3002\u6c23\u4e4b\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8eab\u534a\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e09\u77e3\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u5206\u4e5f\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u8eab\u534a\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e09\u77e3\uff0c\u5730\u4e4b\u5206\u4e5f\uff0c\u5730\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\u3002\u4ee5\u540d\u547d\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c23\u547d\u8655\uff0c\u800c\u8a00\u5176\u75c5\uff0c\u534a\u6240\u8b02\u5929\u6a1e\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u4e0a\u52dd\u800c\u4e0b\u4ff1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5730\u540d\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0b\u52dd\u800c\u4e0a\u4ff1\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u5929\u540d\u4e4b\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u52dd\u81f3\u5831\u6c23\uff0c\u5c48\u4f0f\u800c\u672a\u767c\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fa9\u81f3\u5247\u4e0d\u4ee5\u5929\u5730\u7570\u540d\uff0c\u7686\u5982\u5fa9\u6c23\u70ba\u6cd5\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said, What is the meaning of 'above and below'? Qi Bo replied, From the waist up, there are three spirits, which are Heaven's portion; Heaven governs these spirits. From the waist down, there are also three spirits, which are Earth's portion; Earth governs these spirits. Naming and commanding the spirits, determining their locations, and speaking of their illnesses, refer to the celestial pivot. Therefore, if one above is victorious while both are sick below, they are called by the name of Earth; if one below is victorious while both are sick above, they are called by the name of Heaven. The so-called victory and retribution of Qi, being bent and not yet manifested, will eventually be without distinction between Heaven and Earth, just like returning to the spirits.</p> <p>10: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u52dd\u5fa9\u4e4b\u52d5\uff0c\u6642\u6709\u5e38\u4e4e\uff0c\u6c23\u6709\u5fc5\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6642\u6709\u5e38\u4f4d\uff0c\u800c\u6c23\u7121\u5fc5\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u5176\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u521d\u6c23\u7d42\u4e09\u6c23\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\uff0c\u52dd\u4e4b\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u56db\u6c23\u76e1\u7d42\u6c23\uff0c\u5730\u6c23\u4e3b\u4e4b\uff0c\u5fa9\u4e4b\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u6709\u52dd\u5247\u5fa9\uff0c\u7121\u52dd\u5247\u5426\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u5fa9\u5df2\u800c\u52dd\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u52dd\u81f3\u5247\u5fa9\uff0c\u7121\u5e38\u6578\u4e5f\uff0c\u8870\u4e43\u6b62\u8033\u3002\u5fa9\u5df2\u800c\u52dd\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fa9\u5247\u5bb3\uff0c\u6b64\u50b7\u751f\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5fa9\u800c\u53cd\u75c5\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5c45\u975e\u5176\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e0d\u76f8\u5f97\u4e5f\uff0c\u5927\u5fa9\u5176\u52dd\u5247\u4e3b\u52dd\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u53cd\u75c5\u4e5f\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u706b\u71e5\u71b1\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6cbb\u4e4b\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u6c23\u4e4b\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fae\u8005\u96a8\u4e4b\uff0c\u751a\u8005\u5236\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u5fa9\u4e5f\uff0c\u548c\u8005\u5e73\u4e4b\uff0c\u66b4\u8005\u596a\u4e4b\uff0c\u7686\u96a8\u52dd\u6c23\uff0c\u5b89\u5176\u5c48\u4f0f\uff0c\u7121\u554f\u5176\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u70ba\u671f\uff0c\u6b64\u5176\u9053\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor said: The motion of victory and defeat has its time, and there is a necessity to it. Duke Mu said: There is a time for victory and defeat, but there is no necessity in the energy. The Emperor said: I wish to hear of its method. Duke Mu said: With the initial energy, it ends at three energies; Heaven rules the energy of victory, and it is constant. When the four energies are completely exhausted, Earth rules the energy of recovery, which is also constant. If there is a victory, then there will be a recovery; without a victory, there will be an end. The Emperor said: Good. After recovering, what is the state of victory? Duke Mu said: A complete victory brings about recovery, which is without constant numbers, and decay comes to a halt. After recovering and not returning to victory, it becomes a harm, which is a damage to life. The Emperor said: If it reverses and causes illness, why is that? Duke Mu said: Staying away from its position, it does not harmonize, so when the energy of victory is greatly in control, it causes illness, such as excessive heat and fever. The Emperor said: How should it be treated? Duke Mu said: Regarding the energy of victory, follow it gently, and restrain it when it is too much; regarding the energy of recovery, make it even and flat when it is rough, and seize it when it is violent. All follow the energy of victory, secure its bending and submission, without asking about numbers, and make stability the goal - this is its method.</p> <p>11:

Empire: The emperor is asking about the relationship between victory and defeat in terms of yin and yang, as well as the manifestation of different kinds of disease depending on which is victorious. He also asks for treatment advice from Master Qi Bo.</p> <p>Translation: Emperor said: Good. Asking about the relationship between victory and defeat for guest officials. Qi Bo replied: The power of the guest official, when victorious, has no balance. Emperor said: What is the order of defeating? Qi Bo replied: The master wins inferior, raise it; more than enough, cut it; not enough, supplement it; help according to what is advantageous and harmonize according to what is suitable. Adjust the guest official and adapt to the cold and heat; straighten those that are opposite and follow those that are alike. Emperor said: Good. Asking about treating cold and heat, he replied: Wood position master, their vomiting with sourness, their supplementation with pungent. Fire position master, their vomiting with sweetness, their supplementation with salty. Earth position master, their vomiting with bitterness, their supplementation with sweet.

Qi Bo said: As for the guest of yin, use pungent to supplement and use sour to vomit, moderate it.

I wish to hear about the three aspects of Yin and Yang. Lord Huan replied: There is much Qi, and different uses. Emperor: What do you mean by Yang being bright? Lord Huan replied: When two Yangs combine, they shine brightly. Emperor: What do you mean by Shao Yin (the Kidney)? Lord Huan replied: When two Yins intermingle completely. Emperor: There is much Qi, diseases are severe or mild, treatments are gentle or urgent, and prescriptions are large or small. I wish to hear about the essentials of these. Lord Huan replied: There is high and low Qi, diseases are near or far away, diagnoses are inner or outer, treatments are light or heavy, following this approach leads to success. The Great Treatise says: With ruler and minister as one, there is an odd system; with ruler and minister as four, there is an even system; with ruler and minister as two, there is an odd system; with ruler and minister as six, there is an even system. Therefore, it is said that nearer ones are more odd, further ones are more even, perspiration is not considered odd, lower ones are not considered even, supplementing the upper treatment and urgency, regulating by being gentle, supplementing the lower treatment and haste, hastening thickens the Qi flavor, and being gentle thins it; this is what is meant by following these essentials. When a disease is distant, yet one follows the middle path of Qi flavor, eating while passing it, there is no violation of the method. Thus, regulating Qi's middle path involves approaching odd and even in the treatment, making the prescription smaller for the odd approach and larger for the even approach. Larger means fewer prescriptions, and smaller means more prescriptions. More prescribes nine, while less prescribes two. If the odd does not disappear, then the even will take its place, which is called a heavy method. If the even does not disappear, then it supports by counteracting, treating according to the patient's cold, heat, hot and cool reversals following the disease. Emperor: Good. Diseases arise from their root, and I understand this. How should one treat when there is a label (diagnosis)? Lord Huan replied: If the disease reverses its root, it becomes a labeled disease; treating by reversing the root, use the labeled method.</p> <p>13: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u516d\u6c23\u4e4b\u52dd\uff0c\u4f55\u4ee5\u5019\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e58\u5176\u81f3\u4e5f\uff0c\u6e05\u6c23\u5927\u4f86\uff0c\u71e5\u4e4b\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u98a8\u6728\u53d7\u90aa\uff0c\u809d\u75c5\u751f\u7109\u3002\u71b1\u6c23\u5927\u4f86\uff0c\u706b\u4e4b\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u91d1\u71e5\u53d7\u90aa\uff0c\u80ba\u75c5\u751f\u7109\u3002\u5bd2\u6c23\u5927\u4f86\uff0c\u6c34\u4e4b\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u706b\u71b1\u53d7\u90aa\uff0c\u5fc3\u75c5\u751f\u7109\u3002\u6fd5\u6c23\u5927\u4f86\uff0c\u571f\u4e4b\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u5bd2\u6c34\u53d7\u90aa\uff0c\u814e\u75c5\u751f\u7109\u3002\u98a8\u6c23\u5927\u4f86\uff0c\u6728\u4e4b\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u571f\u6fd5\u53d7\u90aa\uff0c\u813e\u75c5\u751f\u7109\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u611f\u90aa\u800c\u751f\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u4e58\u5e74\u4e4b\u865b\uff0c\u5247\u90aa\u751a\u4e5f\u3002\u5931\u6642\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u4ea6\u90aa\u751a\u4e5f\u3002\u9047\u6708\u4e4b\u7a7a\uff0c\u4ea6\u90aa\u751a\u4e5f\u3002\u91cd\u611f\u65bc\u90aa\uff0c\u5247\u75c5\u5371\u77e3\u3002\u6709\u52dd\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u5176\u5fc5\u4f86\u5fa9\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u8108\u81f3\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u81f3\u5176\u8108\u5f26\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u81f3\u5176\u8108\u9264\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u81f3\u5176\u8108\u6c88\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u81f3\u5927\u800c\u6d6e\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u81f3\u77ed\u800c\u6fc7\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u81f3\u5927\u800c\u9577\u3002\u81f3\u800c\u548c\u5247\u5e73\uff0c\u81f3\u800c\u751a\u5247\u75c5\uff0c\u81f3\u800c\u53cd\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u81f3\u800c\u4e0d\u81f3\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u672a\u81f3\u800c\u81f3\u8005\u75c5\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u6613\u8005\u5371\u3002 Emperor: Good. What is the way to predict the victorious ascendance of the six qi? Duke of Shuo replied: One should take advantage of its peak, when the clear qi arrives in abundance, the fire prevails, the wood and metal suffer from pathogenic factors, causing liver disease. When the heat qi arrives in abundance, the fire prevails, the metal and earth suffer from pathogenic factors, causing lung disease. When the cold qi arrives in abundance, the water prevails, the fire and heat suffer from pathogenic factors, causing heart disease. When the dampness qi arrives in abundance, the soil prevails, the cold and water suffer from pathogenic factors, causing kidney disease. When the wind qi arrives in abundance, the wood prevails, the soil and dampness suffer from pathogenic factors, causing stomach disease. In general, contracting a pathogenic factor causes illness. Riding the fluctuations of age, the pathogenic factor becomes severe. Missing the harmony of time, this also indicates a severe pathogenic factor. Encountering the void of the month, this also indicates a severe pathogenic factor. Suffering from a stronger pathogenic factor, then the illness will be critical. If there is a victorious qi, it must return. Emperor: How does the pulse reach its peak? Duke of Shuo replied: When the kidney qi reaches its peak, the pulse will be tight; when the yin qi of the lower body reaches its peak, the pulse will be hook-like; when the yin qi of the upper body reaches its peak, the pulse will be sunken; when the yang qi of the lower body reaches a large and floating state, the pulse will be short and weak; when the radiant qi reaches a large and long state, this indicates a dangerous situation.</p> <p>14: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u516d\u6c23\u6a19\u672c\uff0c\u6240\u5f9e\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u6709\u5f9e\u672c\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5f9e\u6a19\u672c\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u4e0d\u5f9e\u6a19\u672c\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5c11\u967d\u592a\u9670\u5f9e\u672c\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u592a\u967d\u5f9e\u672c\u5f9e\u6a19\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u53a5\u9670\u4e0d\u5f9e\u6a19\u672c\u5f9e\u4e4e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u5f9e\u672c\u8005\uff0c\u5316\u751f\u65bc\u672c\uff0c\u5f9e\u6a19\u672c\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u6a19\u672c\u4e4b\u5316\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e2d\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e2d\u6c23\u70ba\u5316\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u5f9e\u800c\u75c5\u53cd\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u8a3a\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u81f3\u800c\u5f9e\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u4e0d\u9f13\uff0c\u8af8\u967d\u7686\u7136\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8af8\u9670\u4e4b\u53cd\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8108\u81f3\u800c\u5f9e\uff0c\u6309\u4e4b\u9f13\u751a\u800c\u76db\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u6545\u767e\u75c5\u4e4b\u8d77\uff0c\u6709\u751f\u65bc\u672c\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u751f\u65bc\u647d\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u751f\u65bc\u4e2d\u6c23\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u53d6\u672c\u800c\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u53d6\u647d\u800c\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u53d6\u4e2d\u6c23\u800c\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u53d6\u647d\u672c\u800c\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u9006\u53d6\u800c\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u5f9e\u53d6\u800c\u5f97\u8005\u3002\u9006\uff0c\u6b63\u9806\u4e5f\u3002\u82e5\u9806\uff0c\u9006\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u77e5\u647d\u8207\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u4e4b\u4e0d\u6b86\uff0c\u660e\u77e5\u9006\u9806\uff0c\u6b63\u884c\u7121\u554f\u3002\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u662f\u8005\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8a00\u8a3a\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e82\u7d93\u3002\u6545\u300a\u5927\u8981\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u7c97\u5de5\u563b\u563b\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u53ef\u77e5\uff0c\u8a00\u71b1\u672a\u5df2\uff0c\u5bd2\u75c5\u5fa9\u59cb\uff0c\u540c\u6c23\u7570\u5f62\uff0c\u8ff7\u8a3a\u4e82\u7d93\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u6a19\u672c\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u8981\u800c\u535a\uff0c\u5c0f\u800c\u5927\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8a00\u4e00\u800c\u77e5\u767e\u75c5\u4e4b\u5bb3\uff0c\u8a00\u647d\u8207\u672c\uff0c\u6613\u800c\u52ff\u640d\uff0c\u5bdf\u672c\u8207\u647d\uff0c\u6c23\u53ef\u4ee4\u8abf\uff0c\u660e\u77e5\u52dd\u5fa9\uff0c\u70ba\u842c\u6c11\u5f0f\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u9053\u7562\u77e3\u3002 The Emperor said: What about the six Qi patterns? If they originate from different sources, how can this be? Kuang-pen said: Qi has origins that come from within and those that come from without. The Emperor said: Please elaborate on this point. Kuang-pen said: Yang Ming and Shao Yin have their origins within. Shao Yang and Tai Yin have both an origin and a mark. It is from the middle Qi where they originate. The Emperor asked: If the pulse indicates disease in reverse, how should one diagnose? Kuang-pen said: When the pulse arrives and is felt, but not pulsating, all Yang are like this. The Emperor asked: How about the reversal of Yin? Kuang-pen said: When the pulse arrives and is pulsating greatly and abundant, it is like this. Therefore, in the onset of one hundred diseases, some originate from within, some from an exterior source, some from the middle Qi, some by taking what is within, some by taking what is exterior, and some by taking the middle Qi. Some are reversed, some are correct, and some are mixed. If things are correct, then they will be reversed; if they are reversed, then they will be corrected. This is why it says: Knowing the exterior and using it does not lead to peril, knowing right from wrong ensures proper conduct without doubt. This is what is meant by this. Not knowing cause and effect is insufficient for speaking of diagnosis, but sufficient for confusing medical texts. Therefore, the Great Collection says: A crude worker speaks arrogantly, saying he can distinguish between heat and cold, with fever and cold diseases starting anew, same Qi different forms, confusing diagnosis and confusing medical texts, this is what is meant. The path of mark and origin is profound and far-reaching, small yet great, able to speak of one and know a hundred diseases' harm, speaking of the exterior and the origin is easy but must not be careless, discerning the origin and exterior, Qi can be regulated, knowing victory and defeat is exemplary for all people, and this completes the way of Heaven.</p> <p>15: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u52dd\u5fa9\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u65e9\u664f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u6240\u52dd\u8005\uff0c\u52dd\u81f3\u5df2\u75c5\uff0c\u75c5\u5df2\u614d\u614d\uff0c\u800c\u5fa9\u5df2\u840c\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u6240\u5fa9\u8005\uff0c\u52dd\u76e1\u800c\u8d77\uff0c\u5f97\u4f4d\u800c\u751a\uff0c\u52dd\u6709\u5fae\u751a\uff0c\u5fa9\u6709\u5c11\u591a\uff0c\u52dd\u548c\u800c\u548c\uff0c\u52dd\u865b\u800c\u865b\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u52dd\u5fa9\u4e4b\u4f5c\uff0c\u52d5\u4e0d\u7576\u4f4d\uff0c\u6216\u5f8c\u6642\u800c\u81f3\uff0c\u5176\u6545\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u6c23\u4e4b\u751f\uff0c\u8207\u5176\u5316\u8870\u76db\u7570\u4e5f\u3002\u5bd2\u6691\u6eab\u6dbc\u76db\u8870\u4e4b\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u56db\u7dad\u3002\u6545\u967d\u4e4b\u52d5\uff0c\u59cb\u65bc\u6eab\uff0c\u76db\u65bc\u6691\uff0c\u9670\u4e4b\u52d5\uff0c\u59cb\u65bc\u6e05\uff0c\u76db\u65bc\u5bd2\u3002\u6625\u590f\u79cb\u51ac\uff0c\u5404\u5dee\u5176\u5206\u3002\u6545\u300a\u5927\u8981\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u5f7c\u6625\u4e4b\u6696\uff0c\u70ba\u590f\u4e4b\u6691\uff0c\u5f7c\u79cb\u4e4b\u5fff\uff0c\u70ba\u51ac\u4e4b\u6012\uff0c\u8b39\u6309\u56db\u7dad\uff0c\u65a5\u5019\u7686\u6b78\uff0c\u5176\u7d42\u53ef\u898b\uff0c\u5176\u59cb\u53ef\u77e5\u3002\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5dee\u6709\u6578\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u53c8\u51e1\u4e09\u5341\u5ea6\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u8108\u61c9\u7686\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5dee\u540c\u6b63\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f85\u6642\u800c\u53bb\u4e5f\u3002\u8108\u8981\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u4e0d\u6c88\uff0c\u590f\u4e0d\u5f26\uff0c\u51ac\u4e0d\u6fc7\uff0c\u79cb\u4e0d\u6578\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u56db\u585e\u3002\u6c88\u751a\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u5f26\u751a\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u6fc7\u751a\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u6578\u751a\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u53c3\u898b\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u5fa9\u898b\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u672a\u53bb\u800c\u53bb\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u53bb\u800c\u4e0d\u53bb\u66f0\u75c5\uff0c\u53cd\u8005\u6b7b\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u4e4b\u76f8\u5b88\u53f8\u4e5f\uff0c\u5982\u6b0a\u8861\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5f97\u76f8\u5931\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u6e05\u975c\u5247\u751f\u5316\u6cbb\uff0c\u52d5\u5247\u82db\u75be\u8d77\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5e7d\u660e\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5169\u9670\u4ea4\u76e1\u6545\u66f0\u5e7d\uff0c\u5169\u967d\u5408\u660e\u6545\u66f0\u660e\uff0c\u5e7d\u660e\u4e4b\u914d\uff0c\u5bd2\u6691\u4e4b\u7570\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5206\u81f3\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c23\u81f3\u4e4b\u8b02\u81f3\uff0c\u6c23\u5206\u4e4b\u8b02\u5206\uff0c\u81f3\u5247\u6c23\u540c\uff0c\u5206\u5247\u6c23\u7570\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u6b63\u7d00\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u8a00\u6625\u79cb\u6c23\u59cb\u4e8e\u524d\uff0c\u51ac\u590f\u6c23\u59cb\u4e8e\u5f8c\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\u3002\u7136\u516d\u6c23\u5f80\u5fa9\uff0c\u4e3b\u6b72\u4e0d\u5e38\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u88dc\u5beb\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6240\u4e3b\uff0c\u96a8\u5176\u6538\u5229\uff0c\u6b63\u5176\u5473\uff0c\u5247\u5176\u8981\u4e5f\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u540c\u6cd5\u3002\u300a\u5927\u8981\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u4e3b\uff0c\u5148\u7518\u5f8c\u9e79\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u4e3b\uff0c\u5148\u8f9b\u5f8c\u9178\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u4e3b\uff0c\u5148\u9e79\u5f8c\u82e6\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u4e3b\uff0c\u5148\u9178\u5f8c\u8f9b\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u4e3b\uff0c\u5148\u7518\u5f8c\u9e79\uff0c\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u4e3b\uff0c\u5148\u82e6\u5f8c\u7518\uff0c\u4f50\u4ee5\u6240\u5229\uff0c\u8cc7\u4ee5\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5f97\u6c23\u3002 Emperor said: What of the victory and defeat in change? What is it like to be young and old? The Duke of Zhou replied: The one who wins, when the victory has been achieved, has already fallen ill, and the illness already has some recovery. The one who recovers, having won completely and arising, has a great position, winning has a little, recovering has more or less, winning is harmonious and in harmony, losing is also in harmony. What is the cause of victory and defeat changing? The Duke of Zhou replied: The energy's generation and decline differ greatly. The influences of hot and cold, moist and dry, abundant and declining have their uses in the four seasons. Therefore, the Yang movement begins with warmth, is most abundant in heat, while the Yin movement begins with clarity and is most abundant in cold. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each have their own differences. Therefore, the Great Learning says: The warmth of spring becomes the heat of summer, the clarity of autumn becomes the cold of winter, carefully observe the four seasons, all signs are gathered here, and this is what is meant. The Emperor asked: Are there differences? The Duke of Zhou replied: Again, it is thirty degrees. The Emperor asked: How should the pulse be? The Duke of Zhou replied: Differences follow the regular law and change with time. The pulse standard says: In spring, do not sink; in summer, do not tighten; in winter, do not scatter; in autumn, do not number. This is called the four stoppages. Sinking too much indicates illness, tightening too much indicates illness, scattering too much indicates illness, numbering too much indicates illness, seeing and disappearing indicate illness, appearing and not disappearing indicate illness, reversed indicates death. Therefore it is said: The energy of Yin and Yang mutually guards the regulation, like the balance and scale that do not miss each other. The Duke of Zhou said: Hiding and brightness are the result of Yin and Yang mingling completely. How should they be divided? The Emperor asked: At what point? The Duke of Zhou replied: Regarding the energy, when it is complete, it is called 'at', and regarding the division, it is called 'division'. Complete, then the energy is the same; divide, then the energy is different. This is the heavenly law. The Emperor said: Master, how should spring and autumn energy begin in front, and summer and winter energy begin behind? I already know this. However, the six energies going back and forth control the year without being constant, how should they be supplemented and written? The Duke of Zhou replied: Regarding what is above and below, follow their utility, regulate their flavor, then that is its principle. The 'Great Learning' says: Regarding the energy of Shao Yang, it is salty before and bitter afterward; regarding the energy of Yang Ming, it is sour before and acidic afterward; regarding the energy of Tai Yang, it is bitter before and harsh afterward; regarding the energy of Shao Yin, it is salty before and bitter afterward; regarding the energy of Tai Yin, it is harsh before and sweet afterward. Support it with what is useful to it, provide it with what is generated by it, and this is called obtaining energy.</p> <p>16: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u592b\u767e\u75c5\u4e4b\u751f\u4e5f\uff0c\u7686\u751f\u65bc\u98a8\u5bd2\u6691\u6fd5\u71e5\u706b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e4b\u5316\u4e4b\u8b8a\u4e5f\u3002\u7d93\u8a00\u76db\u8005\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u865b\u8005\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u4f59\u932b\u4ee5\u65b9\u58eb\uff0c\u800c\u65b9\u58eb\u7528\u4e4b\u5c1a\u672a\u80fd\u5341\u5168\uff0c\u4f59\u6b32\u4ee4\u8981\u9053\u5fc5\u884c\uff0c\u6874\u9f13\u76f8\u61c9\uff0c\u7336\u62d4\u523a\u96ea\u6c59\uff0c\u5de5\u5de7\u795e\u8056\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u805e\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5be9\u5bdf\u75c5\u6a5f\u7121\u5931\u6c23\u5b9c\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u75c5\u6a5f\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8af8\u98a8\u6389\u80d81\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u809d\u3002\u8af8\u5bd2\u6536\u5f15\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u814e\u3002\u8af8\u6c23\u81b9\u9b31\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u80ba\u3002\u8af8\u6fd5\u816b\u6eff\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u813e\u3002\u8af8\u71b1\u7780\u761b\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u706b\u3002\u8af8\u75c5\u75d2\u7621\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u5fc3\u3002\u8af8\u53a5\u56fa\u6cc4\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u4e0b\u3002\u8af8\u75ff\u5598\u5614\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u4e0a\u3002\u8af8\u7981\u9f13\u6144\uff0c\u5982\u55aa\u795e\u5b88\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u706b\u3002\u8af8\u75d9\u9805\u5f37\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u6fd5\u3002\u8af8\u9006\u885d\u4e0a\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u706b\u3002\u8af8\u8139\u8179\u5927\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u71b1\u3002\u8af8\u8e81\u72c2\u8d8a\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u706b\u3002\u8af8\u66b4\u5f37\u76f4\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u98a8\u3002\u8af8\u75c5\u6709\u8072\u9f13\u4e4b\u5982\u9f13\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u71b1\u3002\u8af8\u75c5\u80d5\u816b\u75bc\u9178\u9a5a\u99ed\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u706b\u3002\u8af8\u8f49\u53cd\u623e\u6c34\u6db2\u6e3e\u6fc1\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u71b1\u3002\u8af8\u75c5\u6c34\u6db2\u6f84\u6f88\u6e05\u51b7\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u5bd2\u3002\u8af8\u5614\u5410\u9178\u66b4\u6ce8\u4e0b\u8feb\uff0c\u7686\u5c6c\u65bc\u71b1\u3002\u6545\u300a\u5927\u8981\u300b\u66f0\uff1a\u8b39\u5b88\u75c5\u6a5f\uff0c\u5404\u53f8\u5176\u5c6c\uff0c\u6709\u8005\u6c42\u4e4b\uff0c\u7121\u8005\u6c42\u4e4b\uff0c\u76db\u8005\u8cac\u4e4b\uff0c\u865b\u8005\u8cac\u4e4b\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u4e94\u52dd\uff0c\u8e08\u5176\u8840\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee4\u5176\u8abf\u9054\uff0c\u800c\u81f4\u548c\u5e73\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u30021. \u80d8 : \u6216\u4f5c\u300c\u7729\u300d\u3002\u300a\u4e7e\u9686\u5fa1\u89bd\u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8\u8588\u8981\u300b\u672c\u4f5c\u300c\u7729\u300d\u3002 Emperor said: Good. All illnesses are generated from the six external factors of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire, which cause transformation and change. The Classics say that those who excel in this should write about it, while those who lack understanding should supplement it. I will make the essential principles of medicine definite, clear and precise, so that there is no way they cannot be put into practice. The Marquis of Wu said: Examining the pathology of illness, this is what is meant. Emperor asked: I wish to hear what the pathology of illness is like. The Marquis of Wu replied: All wind causing coughs and convulsions belong to the liver. All cold causing contraction and retracting belong to the kidneys. All qi stagnation causing oppression belongs to the lungs. All dampness causing swelling and fullness belongs to the spleen. All heat causing itching and eruptions belongs to fire. All feebleness of limbs, shortness of breath, and vomiting belong to the heart. All incontinence of urine and defecation belongs to the bladder. All weakness and wheezing, as well as hiccoughs, belong to the upper part. All trembling, rigidity, and convulsions belong to fire. All swelling and pain in the neck belong to dampness. All reversed and surging upwards belong to fire. All distension and bloating of the abdomen belong to heat. All restlessness and madness beyond control belong to fire. All sudden strength and rigidity belong to wind. All illnesses with drumming sounds, like drums, belong to heat. All sickness with lumps, swelling, pain, shock, and alarm belong to fire. All diseases that reverse, thicken, and pollute fluids belong to heat. All sicknesses with clear and cold fluids belong to cold. All nausea, vomiting, and harsh registration downward belong to heat. Therefore, the Classic of Essential Prescriptions says: Be meticulous in guarding the pathology of illness, and let each organ handle its own respective function. Seek what is present and seek what is absent, make those who excel accountable, and rebuke those who are deficient. First achieve the five victories, regulate the blood and qi, and establish harmony and peace, this is what is meant.</p> <p>17: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u4e94\u5473\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u7528\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8f9b\u7518\u767c\u6563\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u9178\u82e6\u6d8c\u6cc4\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u9e79\u5473\u6d8c\u6cc4\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u6de1\u5473\u6ef2\u6cc4\u70ba\u967d\u3002\u516d\u8005\uff0c\u6216\u6536\uff0c\u6216\u6563\uff0c\u6216\u7de9\uff0c\u6216\u6025\uff0c\u6216\u71e5\uff0c\u6216\u6f64\uff0c\u6216\u800e\uff0c\u6216\u5805\uff0c\u4ee5\u6240\u5229\u800c\u884c\u4e4b\uff0c\u8abf\u5176\u6c23\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5e73\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u975e\u8abf\u6c23\u800c\u5f97\u8005\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6709\u6bd2\u7121\u6bd2\uff0c\u4f55\u5148\u4f55\u5f8c\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u9053\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u6bd2\u7121\u6bd2\uff0c\u6240\u6cbb\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u9069\u5927\u5c0f\u70ba\u5236\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8acb\u8a00\u5176\u5236\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u541b\u4e00\u81e3\u4e8c\uff0c\u5236\u4e4b\u5c0f\u4e5f\uff0c\u541b\u4e00\u81e3\u4e09\u4f50\u4e94\uff0c\u5236\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4e5f\uff0c\u541b\u4e00\u81e3\u4e09\u4f50\u4e5d\uff0c\u5236\u4e4b\u5927\u4e5f\u3002\u5bd2\u8005\u71b1\u4e4b\uff0c\u71b1\u8005\u5bd2\u4e4b\uff0c\u5fae\u8005\u9006\u4e4b\uff0c\u751a\u8005\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u5805\u8005\u524a\u4e4b\uff0c\u5ba2\u8005\u9664\u4e4b\uff0c\u52de\u8005\u6eab\u4e4b\uff0c\u7d50\u8005\u6563\u4e4b\uff0c\u7559\u8005\u653b\u4e4b\uff0c\u71e5\u8005\u6fe1\u4e4b\uff0c\u6025\u8005\u7de9\u4e4b\uff0c\u6563\u8005\u6536\u4e4b\uff0c\u640d\u8005\u6eab\u4e4b\uff0c\u9038\u8005\u884c\u4e4b\uff0c\u9a5a\u8005\u5e73\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e4b\u4e0b\u4e4b\uff0c\u6469\u4e4b\u6d74\u4e4b\uff0c\u8584\u4e4b\u52ab\u4e4b\uff0c\u958b\u4e4b\u767c\u4e4b\uff0c\u9069\u4e8b\u70ba\u6545\u3002 Emperor said: Good. How is the use of five flavors of yin and yang? Kuai Bo said: Sweet and spicy are yang, sour and bitter are yin, salty flavor is yin, bland is yang. Six of them can be taken in or released outwards, can be slow or quick, dry or moist, soft or hard, light or dense, depending on their benefits to act accordingly, adjust the qi and make it balanced. Emperor said: If not adjusting the qi, how can one treat? Poisonous and non-poisonous, which comes first, which comes later, I wish to hear the method. Kuai Bo said: The treated object is the primary focus, and adjusting the small or large depending on the condition is the method. Emperor said: Please explain the method. Kuai Bo said: A ruler and minister as a small method, a ruler, minister, and three assistants as a medium method, and a ruler, minister, three assistants, and nine attendants as a great method. Cold treatment with heat, hot treatment with cold, mild treatment with inversion, severe treatment with following, hard treatment with deletion, outsiders with elimination, labor with warmth, knot with dispersion, stay with attack, dryness with moisture, quickness with slowness, scattering with collection, damage with warmth, leisure with action, surprise with stability, up and down with massage and bath, thin with robbery, opening with release, appropriate events as a basis.</p> <p>18: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u9006\u5f9e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u9006\u8005\u6b63\u6cbb\uff0c\u5f9e\u8005\u53cd\u6cbb\uff0c\u5f9e\u5c11\u5f9e\u591a\uff0c\u89c0\u5176\u4e8b\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u53cd\u6cbb\u4f55\u8b02\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u71b1\u56e0\u5bd2\u7528\uff0c\u5bd2\u56e0\u71b1\u7528\uff0c\u585e\u56e0\u585e\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u56e0\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u5fc5\u4f0f\u5176\u6240\u4e3b\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u5176\u6240\u56e0\uff0c\u5176\u59cb\u5247\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u7d42\u5247\u7570\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u7834\u7a4d\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u6f70\u5805\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u6c23\u548c\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u5fc5\u5df2\u3002 The emperor asked, What is meant by disobedience? Zhou Bo replied, Disobedience refers to acting contrary to proper conduct and obedience refers to acting in accordance with proper conduct. Obedience may be greater or lesser; one should observe the specific actions. The emperor then asked, What do you mean by 'acting contrary'? Zhou Bo responded, When it is hot, use cold; when it is cold, use heat; when there is a blockage, use a blockage; and when there is openness, use openness. One must seize the subject and precede its cause. If one's actions are consistent at the beginning, they will become divergent in the end. This allows for the breakdown of accumulated strength, the weakening of firm resolve, the harmonizing of energies, and ultimately brings about completion.</p> <p>19: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u6c23\u8abf\u800c\u5f97\u8005\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u9006\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u9006\u800c\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f9e\u800c\u9006\u4e4b\uff0c\u8e08\u6c23\u4ee4\u8abf\u5247\u5176\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u75c5\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5916\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5f9e\u5167\u4e4b\u5916\u8005\u8abf\u5176\u5167\uff0c\u5f9e\u5916\u4e4b\u5167\u8005\u6cbb\u5176\u5916\uff0c\u5f9e\u5167\u4e4b\u5916\u800c\u76db\u65bc\u5916\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u8abf\u5176\u5167\u800c\u5f8c\u6cbb\u5176\u5916\uff0c\u5f9e\u5916\u4e4b\u5167\u800c\u76db\u65bc\u5167\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u6cbb\u5176\u5916\u800c\u5f8c\u8abf\u5176\u5167\uff0c\u4e2d\u5916\u4e0d\u76f8\u53ca\uff0c\u5247\u6cbb\u4e3b\u75c5\u3002 The sovereign said: Good.

How about treating diseases inside and outside?

Fire is hot and evil cold, developing a fever is like an attack of malaria, occurring either in one day or after several days of idleness, why is this? Minister Kan: The victorious qi meets the time, with how much strength there is. If yin qi is abundant and yang qi is deficient, then the onset will be delayed. If yang qi is abundant and yin qi is deficient, then the onset will be soon. This principle of victorious qi's ebb and flow also applies to malaria. Emperor: In discussing treating cold with heat and heat with cold, physicians cannot abandon their theories and update their methods. There are patients who develop a fever due to cold when they have heat illnesses, and there are those who develop chilliness due to heat when they have cold illnesses; both occur in the early stages of new disease onset. Minister Kan: In treating patients with heat illness who develop a fever, target the yin aspect, and in treating those with cold illness who develop chills, target the yang aspect, seeking what belongs to them. Emperor: Good. Patients who develop chills while taking medicine for cold or those who develop fever while taking medicine for heat, why is this? Minister Kan: This is due to failing to treat the royal qi. Emperor: If one fails to treat the royal qi, what is the result? Minister Kan: It is a complete mystery. Failing to treat the five flavors as they belong leads to this outcome. When the five flavors enter the stomach, each goes to its preferred place, attacking sourness first enters the liver, bitter first enters the heart, sweet first enters the spleen, pungent first enters the lungs, salty first enters the kidneys, accumulating qi over time is the norm for transforming substances. When qi accumulates over time, it leads to premature death.</p> <p>21: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u65b9\u5236\u541b\u81e3\u4f55\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e3b\u75c5\u4e4b\u8b02\u541b\uff0c\u4f50\u541b\u4e4b\u8b02\u81e3\uff0c\u61c9\u81e3\u4e4b\u8b02\u4f7f\uff0c\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e09\u54c1\u4e4b\u8b02\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u54c1\u4f55\u8b02\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6240\u4ee5\u660e\u5584\u60e1\u4e4b\u6b8a\u8cab\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u75c5\u4e4b\u4e2d\u5916\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8abf\u6c23\u4e4b\u65b9\uff0c\u5fc5\u5225\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5b9a\u5176\u4e2d\u5916\uff0c\u5404\u5b88\u5176\u9109\u3002\u5167\u8005\u5167\u6cbb\uff0c\u5916\u8005\u5916\u6cbb\uff0c\u5fae\u8005\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u5e73\u4e4b\uff0c\u76db\u8005\u596a\u4e4b\uff0c\u6c57\u8005\u4e0b\u4e4b\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u6eab\u6dbc\uff0c\u8870\u4e4b\u4ee5\u5c6c\uff0c\u96a8\u5176\u6538\u5229\uff0c\u8b39\u9053\u5982\u6cd5\uff0c\u842c\u8209\u842c\u5168\uff0c\u6c23\u8840\u6b63\u5e73\uff0c\u9577\u6709\u5929\u547d\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002 Emperor: Good. What does establishing ruler and minister mean? Duke of Zhou replied: The one who is in charge of the disease is called the ruler, the one who assists the ruler is called the minister, the one who responds to the minister is called the attendant, and these are not the three ranks above and below. Emperor: What are the three ranks? Duke of Zhou replied: This is used to distinguish between good and evil. Emperor: Good. How about treating the disease inside and outside? Duke of Zhou replied: The method of regulating qi must differentiate between yin and yang, establish its internal and external aspects, and each guard their respective domains. Inside, one should treat internally; outside, one should treat externally; refine what is subtle and harmonize it; if there is excess, remove it; if there is sweating, let it out; if it is cold or hot, mild or cool, use it to nourish and support life according to the appropriate method. Be cautious in following the way, fully accomplishing all actions, regulating qi and blood, maintaining harmony, and one will have a long life according to Heaven's decree.

He hoped to receive the teaching of Heaven's measure, understanding the harmony of yin and yang at the four seasons, differentiating the stars and constellations from the sun, moon, and light, using this to clarify the classics, thereby making later generations more enlightened, leading the way in understanding the divine farmer, and leaving behind a teachable method for the two emperors.</p> <p>The Yellow Emperor said, Good. There is no failure here; this is all about the yin and yang above and below, front and back, female and male corresponding and responding to each other. The Way understands the celestial theories of Heaven and knows the geography of the earth, as well as understanding human affairs, which can be long-lasting. By teaching the multitudes, there is no doubt that it will suffice, and the medical methodology can be passed down to future generations and become a treasure.</p> <p>L\u00fc said, Please grant me the Way, and I will recite and use it.</p> <p>2: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5b50\u4e0d\u805e\u9670\u967d\u50b3\u4e4e\u3002\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u77e5\u3002\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u4e09\u967d\u5929\u70ba\u696d\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7121\u5e38\uff0c\u5408\u800c\u75c5\u81f3\uff0c\u504f\u5bb3\u9670\u967d\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u967d\u83ab\u7576\uff0c\u8acb\u805e\u5176\u89e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u967d\u7368\u81f3\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u4e09\u967d\u5e76\u81f3\uff0c\u5e76\u81f3\u5982\u98a8\u96e8\uff0c\u4e0a\u70ba\u5dd4\u75be\uff0c\u4e0b\u70ba\u6f0f\u75c5\u3002\u5916\u7121\u671f\uff0c\u5167\u7121\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0d\u4e2d\u7d93\u7d00\uff0c\u8a3a\u7121\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f8\u5225\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u81e3\u6cbb\u8e08\u6108\uff0c\u8aaa\u610f\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u81f3\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u7a4d\u5e76\u5247\u70ba\u9a5a\uff0c\u75c5\u8d77\u75be\u98a8\uff0c\u81f3\u5982\u7914\u7930\uff0c\u4e5d\u7ac5\u7686\u585e\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u6ec2\u6ea2\uff0c\u4e7e\u55cc\u5589\u585e\uff0c\u5e76\u65bc\u9670\uff0c\u5247\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7121\u5e38\uff0c\u8584\u70ba\u8178\u6fbc\u3002\u6b64\u8b02\u4e09\u967d\u76f4\u5fc3\uff0c\u5750\u4e0d\u5f97\u8d77\uff0c\u81e5\u8005\u4fbf\u8eab\u5168\uff0c\u4e09\u967d\u4e4b\u75c5\u3002\u4e14\u4ee5\u77e5\u5929\u4e0b\u4f55\u4ee5\u5225\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u5408\u4e4b\u4e94\u884c\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u8a00\u4e0d\u5225\uff0c\u9670\u8a00\u4e0d\u7406\uff0c\u8acb\u8d77\u53d7\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u81f3\u9053\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5b50\u82e5\u53d7\u50b3\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5408\u81f3\u9053\u4ee5\u60d1\u5e2b\u6559\uff0c\u8a9e\u5b50\u81f3\u9053\u4e4b\u8981\u3002\u75c5\u50b7\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u7b4b\u9aa8\u4ee5\u6d88\uff0c\u5b50\u8a00\u4e0d\u660e\u4e0d\u5225\uff0c\u662f\u4e16\u4e3b\u5b78\u76e1\u77e3\u3002\u814e\u4e14\u7d55\uff0c\u60cb\u60cb\uff0c\u65e5\u66ae\u5f9e\u5bb9\u4e0d\u51fa\uff0c\u4eba\u4e8b\u4e0d\u6bb7\u3002 The Emperor said: Zi, do you not hear of the Yin and Yang tradition?  Zi replied, I am ignorant.  The Emperor said: Heaven has its three Yang lines, upper and lower changing, merging and becoming sick, with Yin and Yang being harmed. Thunder Lord asked, 'May I learn your prescription?' The Emperor said: Three Yang in isolation is as when the Three Yang fully merge, like wind and rain. Up above it is sharp, down below it is leak disease. With no set date for recovery and no proper course, diagnosis misses the mark high and low, and misjudges with written records. Thunder Lord said: My governance of treatment has been incomplete; I am but expressing my intentions.  The Emperor said: Three Yang refers to great Yang, when they accumulate it becomes shock, and illness appears as a sudden wind, like a wild whirlwind, blocking all nine orifices, causing Yang Qi to overflow, stopping up the dryness in the throat, merging with Yin, then upper and lower are unstable, and it becomes shallow for the Stomach, harming the Intestines. This is called Three Yang directly striking the heart, causing it to be unable to stand or lie down, and a person who is lying down will suffer everywhere from Three Yang disease. Furthermore, knowing how to differentiate Yin and Yang throughout the world, and following the changes of the seasons, merging them with the Five Constancies, Thunder Lord asks for an explanation, so that I may understand the great Way. Zi, if you receive this transmission, and do not know how to harmonize with the great Way, you will confuse your teachers and students. You speak without clarity or distinction, and that is the limit of worldly wisdom. The kidneys are also on the verge of vanishing, day by day becoming less and less present, and people's affairs do not become deeper.</p>"},{"location":"76_huangdi-neijing_shi-cong-rong-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u793a\u5f9e\u5bb9\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u71d5\u5750\u53ec\u96f7\u516c\u800c\u554f\u4e4b\u66f0\uff1a\u6c5d\u53d7\u8853\u8aa6\u66f8\u8005\uff0c\u82e5\u80fd\u89bd\u89c0\u96dc\u5b78\uff0c\u53ca\u65bc\u6bd4\u985e\uff0c\u901a\u5408\u9053\u7406\uff0c\u70ba\u4f59\u8a00\u5b50\u6240\u9577\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\uff0c\u81bd\u80c3\u5927\u5c0f\u8178\u813e\u80de\u8180\u80f1\uff0c\u8166\u9ad3\u6d95\u553e\uff0c\u54ed\u6ce3\u60b2\u54c0\uff0c\u6c34\u6240\u5f9e\u884c\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u4eba\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e4b\u904e\u5931\uff0c\u5b50\u52d9\u660e\u4e4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5341\u5168\uff0c\u5373\u4e0d\u80fd\u77e5\uff0c\u70ba\u4e16\u6240\u6028\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u81e3\u8acb\u8aa6\u300a\u8108\u811b\u300b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7bc7\u751a\u773e\u591a\u77e3\uff0c\u5225\u7570\u6bd4\u985e\uff0c\u7336\u672a\u80fd\u4ee5\u5341\u5168\uff0c\u53c8\u5b89\u8db3\u4ee5\u660e\u4e4b\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5b50\u5225\u8a66\u901a\u4e94\u85cf\u4e4b\u904e\uff0c\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u6240\u4e0d\u548c\uff0c\u937c\u77f3\u4e4b\u6557\uff0c\u6bd2\u85e5\u6240\u5b9c\uff0c\u6e6f\u6db2\u6ecb\u5473\uff0c\u5177\u8a00\u5176\u72c0\uff0c\u6089\u8a00\u4ee5\u5c0d\uff0c\u8acb\u554f\u4e0d\u77e5\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u809d\u865b\u814e\u865b\u813e\u865b\uff0c\u7686\u4ee4\u4eba\u9ad4\u91cd\u7169\u51a4\uff0c\u7576\u6295\u6bd2\u85e5\u523a\u7078\u782d\u77f3\u6e6f\u6db2\uff0c\u6216\u5df2\uff0c\u6216\u4e0d\u5df2\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u89e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u516c\u4f55\u5e74\u4e4b\u9577\u800c\u554f\u4e4b\u5c11\uff0c\u4f59\u771f\u554f\u4ee5\u81ea\u8b2c\u4e5f\u3002\u543e\u554f\u5b50\u7a88\u51a5\uff0c\u5b50\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7bc7\u4ee5\u5c0d\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u813e\u865b\u6d6e\u4f3c\u80ba\uff0c\u814e\u5c0f\u6d6e\u4f3c\u813e\uff0c\u809d\u6025\u6c88\u6563\u4f3c\u814e\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u5de5\u4e4b\u6240\u6642\u4e82\u4e5f\uff0c\u7136\u5f9e\u5bb9\u5f97\u4e4b\u3002\u82e5\u592b\u4e09\u85cf\u571f\u6728\u6c34\u53c3\u5c45\uff0c\u6b64\u7ae5\u5b50\u4e4b\u6240\u77e5\u554f\u4e4b\uff0c\u4f55\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor Yellow asked Lei Gong: You are a master of techniques, able to comprehend diverse studies and be proficient in comparison, understand principles and harmonize them. Your teachings should be valuable for my heirs, with the five organs and six bowels, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, saliva, tears, sadness - all aspects of human life that need treatment when they go astray. Can you not make them complete? If you do not know how to treat them, you will be criticized by the world.</p> <p>Lei Gong replied: I have studied the 'Pulse' and 'Awakening to Life' chapters, which contain many complexities and differences that I have not yet been able to master with perfection. How can I explain it clearly? Emperor Yellow said: Try to understand the deficiencies of the five organs and the six bowels. Explain how they are out of harmony, how needles, stones, and medicine should be applied, and how the taste of broths and fluids should be understood. Please ask me any questions you don't know the answers to.</p> <p>Lei Gong said: When the liver, spleen, and kidneys are weak, they cause discomfort in the human body, and I hope to apply acupuncture, moxibustion, stone needles, or medicine. But have I already applied it or not? I wish to know the solution. Emperor Yellow said: Your age is long and you still ask these questions. I truly feel embarrassed to ask you.</p> <p>What about your question? asked Lei Gong. Emperor Yellow explained: When the spleen is deficient, it resembles the lungs; when the kidneys are small and deficient, they resemble the spleen; and when the liver is agitated and dispersed, it resembles the kidneys. All of these are temporary imbalances caused by work, but they can be rectified with tranquility.</p> <p>Lei Gong then said: The five organs and six bowels follow the phases of earth, metal, fire, and water.

What sort of exacerbation has led to this manifestation? The pulse is superficial and tight, I do not know its resolution, and again ask about the three stores to know their comparative category. The Emperor said: That which pertains to serenity. If one grows old, he seeks it in the ministry; if young, in the canon; if mature, in the storehouses. Now, what the son says is all lost, as the eight winds are ripe and the five stores are consumed, transmitting falsehoods. The superficial and tight pulse refers to the kidneys not being sufficient. The sinking and hard pulse refers to the kidneys holding their vital force within. The weak in sinews and bones with deficient vitality refers to the disruption of the water passages and the exhaustion of the formative force. The groaning, moaning, and annoyance refer to the reversal of the vital force of the kidneys. One person's vital energy has a disease located in one storehouse. If one speaks of the three stores being all functional, it is not in accordance with the truth.</p> <p>Lei Gong said: In this case, there is a person who has weakness and stiffness of the four limbs, gasps and coughs with blood leakage, and misdiagnoses the situation, believing it to be lung damage. He cuts the pulse, which is large and tight, and does not dare to treat, crude practitioners use stone needles, and the illness worsens with increased bleeding, bleeding stops and the person becomes weak. What sort of thing is this? The Emperor said: That which you can treat, I also know to be numerous. With this disease, it differs from what you have described. Compare it to a goose soaring in the sky; a sage's method of treating illness follows the laws, relies on material comparisons, transforms according to ancient models, and adheres to the classics both above and below. How can one not follow the classics?</p> <p>Now, with the pulse being large and empty, it refers to the vital energy of the spleen being blocked outside. The two fires not being able to overcome the three waters refer to the disorder of the pulse and lack of constancy. Weakness and stiffness of the four limbs refer to the disruption of water energy and the depletion of formative force. Gasping and coughing, with blood leakage, refers to urgent blood without a path to go. If one believes it to be lung damage, it is due to misunderstanding. Without referring to material comparisons, how can one know?</p> <p>The damaging of the lungs refers to the spleen's vital energy not being contained and the stomach's vital energy not being clear, channel vital force not guiding, the true storehouses being destroyed, the meridians of the channels being on the verge of blockage, the five stores leaking, and without restoration, leading to vomiting. This is not in accordance with the two aspects. Compare it to something formless like heaven or rationality like earth, which are far apart. My mistake lies here; since I know what my son says, I do not tell him, but clarify through material comparisons and serenity, this is called light diagnosis, the ultimate way.</p>"},{"location":"77_huangdi-neijing_shu-wu-guo-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u758f\u4e94\u904e\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u55da\u547c\u9060\u54c9\u3002\u9594\u9594\u4e4e\u82e5\u8996\u6df1\u6df5\uff0c\u82e5\u8fce\u6d6e\u96f2\uff0c\u8996\u6df1\u6df5\u5c1a\u53ef\u6e2c\uff0c\u8fce\u6d6e\u96f2\u83ab\u77e5\u5176\u969b\u3002\u8056\u4eba\u4e4b\u8853\uff0c\u70ba\u842c\u6c11\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ad6\u88c1\u5fd7\u610f\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u6cd5\u5247\uff0c\u5faa\u7d93\u5b88\u6578\uff0c\u6309\u5faa\u91ab\u4e8b\uff0c\u70ba\u842c\u6c11\u526f\uff0c\u6545\u4e8b\u6709\u4e94\u904e\u56db\u5fb7\uff0c\u6c5d\u77e5\u4e4b\u4e4e\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u907f\u5e2d\u518d\u62dc\u66f0\uff1a\u81e3\u5e74\u5e7c\u5c0f\uff0c\u8499\u611a\u4ee5\u60d1\uff0c\u4e0d\u805e\u4e94\u904e\u8207\u56db\u5fb7\uff0c\u6bd4\u985e\u5f62\u540d\u865b\u5f15\u5176\u7d93\uff0c\u5fc3\u7121\u6240\u5c0d\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Ah, so far away!

Those who have experienced poverty and wealth are named loss of vitality. The five energies are retained and there is a simultaneous onset of illness. A physician diagnoses this without being in the palace, does not change the shape of the body, doubts the diagnosis and does not know the name of the disease. As time goes by, one's body gradually weakens, vital energy is deficient without strength, the disease is deep and there is shock, and the disease is deep, causing external loss in the guards and internal loss in reputation. A skilled physician who fails to recognize the condition does not know the patient's state, and this is also a shortcoming in treatment.</p> <p>Those who wish to diagnose diseases should ask about diet, food, residence, excessive enjoyment or severe suffering, starting with pleasure and ending with suffering, all causing damage to vital energy and strength. Vital energy is exhausted to the extreme, the body is ruined and wasted. Rash anger damages yin, rash joy damages yang, excessive qi rises upward and dissipates the form of the pulse. Foolish physicians treat it without knowing how to supplement or rectify, or knowing the patient's condition, and the treasures continue to dissipate, allowing evil qi to be entangled, resulting in poor treatment.</p> <p>Skillful practitioners of the pulse should ask about the noble and humble, cover kings and ministers defeated, and those who desire to become marquises or dukes. Therefore, if one is noble and detached, even without falling ill from evil influences, vital energy is restrained and damaged within, and the body must be destroyed and lost. Those who have experienced wealth and poverty, even without damaging evil influences, skin is withered and tendons are twisted, muscles are stiffened. Physicians who cannot be strict do not know how to mobilize spirit, and externally they are weak and disordered, making it difficult to move the disease, so medical treatment does not work, resulting in poor treatment.</p> <p>Those who practice wind diagnosis must know past and future, have knowledge of remnants, examine the pulse and ask for the name, and match men and women. Leaving off accumulation and restraint, fearing excitement and anger, the five organs are empty and vacant, blood and qi are disordered, physicians do not know how to treat, and their language is incomprehensible. There have been those who have experienced great injury, cutting tendons and severing vessels, restoring the body but causing unrest and accumulation of cold, filling the interior with heat. Coarse physicians treat it by hastily piercing yin and yang, disintegrating the body, and turning muscles into joints, dying at a set time. Physicians do not understand why this happens, do not ask where it comes from, they only say that death will occur at a set time, which is also a shortcoming in treatment.</p> <p>3: \u51e1\u6b64\u4e94\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u53d7\u8853\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u4eba\u4e8b\u4e0d\u660e\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u8056\u4eba\u4e4b\u6cbb\u75c5\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fc5\u77e5\u5929\u5730\u9670\u967d\u56db\u6642\u7d93\u7d00\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u96cc\u96c4\u8868\u88cf\u523a\u7078\u782d\u77f3\u6bd2\u85e5\u6240\u4e3b\uff0c\u5f9e\u5bb9\u4eba\u4e8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u660e\u7d93\u9053\uff0c\u8cb4\u8ce4\u8ca7\u5bcc\uff0c\u5404\u7570\u54c1\u7406\uff0c\u554f\u5e74\u5c11\u9577\uff0c\u52c7\u602f\u4e4b\u7406\uff0c\u5be9\u65bc\u5206\u90e8\uff0c\u77e5\u75c5\u672c\u59cb\uff0c\u516b\u6b63\u4e5d\u5019\uff0c\u8a3a\u5fc5\u526f\u77e3\u3002\u6cbb\u75c5\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u6c23\u5167\u70ba\u5bf6\uff0c\u5faa\u6c42\u5176\u7406\uff0c\u6c42\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u904e\u5728\u8868\u88cf\u3002\u5b88\u6578\u64da\u6cbb\uff0c\u7121\u5931\u4fde\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u884c\u6b64\u8853\uff0c\u7d42\u8eab\u4e0d\u6b86\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u4fde\u7406\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u83c0\u719f\uff0c\u7670\u767c\u516d\u5e9c\u3002\u8a3a\u75c5\u4e0d\u5be9\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u5931\u5e38\uff0c\u8b39\u5b88\u6b64\u6cbb\uff0c\u8207\u7d93\u76f8\u660e\uff0c\u4e0a\u7d93\u4e0b\u7d93\uff0c\u63c6\u5ea6\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5947\u6052\u4e94\u4e2d\uff0c\u6c7a\u4ee5\u660e\u5802\uff0c\u5be9\u65bc\u7d42\u59cb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a6b\u884c\u3002 These five [aspects] are all lacking in knowledge of the art and not clear about human affairs. Thus it is said: The sages' treatment of illness requires knowing the Heaven and Earth yin and yang four seasons' meridians, five organs, six departments, masculine and feminine, surface and interior points of acupuncture, moxibustion, stone, poisonous drugs, the master, being calm about human affairs, illuminating the classics and the way, valuing nobility and poverty, wealth and destitution, each according to their different principles, asking whether young or old, courageous in their reasoning, assessing them at the sections, knowing the root of the disease, the eight regularities and nine symptoms, making a diagnosis. The method of treating illness involves the Qi inside being precious, seeking its principle, seeking it without success lies in the exterior and interior. Guard the numbers in treatment, without failing the principles, those who can practice this art will not be exhausted in their lifetime. Not knowing the principles, the five organs wither and bloom, sores appear in the six departments. Diagnosing diseases is not thorough, that is called deviating from the norm, carefully guarding this treatment, corresponding to the classics, above the classics and below the classics, measuring the yin and yang, the strange persistence of the five centers, deciding by the clear hall, assessing at the beginning and end, it can be crossed horizontally.</p>"},{"location":"78_huangdi-neijing_zheng-si-shi-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u5fb5\u56db\u5931\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u5728\u660e\u5802\uff0c\u96f7\u516c\u4f8d\u5750\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u5b50\u6240\u901a\u66f8\u53d7\u4e8b\u773e\u591a\u77e3\uff0c\u8a66\u8a00\u5f97\u5931\u4e4b\u610f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5f97\u4e4b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5931\u4e4b\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u5faa\u7d93\u53d7\u696d\uff0c\u7686\u8a00\u5341\u5168\uff0c\u5176\u6642\u6709\u904e\u5931\u8005\uff0c\u8acb\u805e\u5176\u4e8b\u89e3\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5b50\u5e74\u5c11\u667a\u672a\u53ca\u90aa\uff0c\u5c07\u8a00\u4ee5\u96dc\u5408\u8036\u3002\u592b\u7d93\u8108\u5341\u4e8c\uff0c\u7d61\u8108\u4e09\u767e\u516d\u5341\u4e94\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u4eba\u4e4b\u6240\u660e\u77e5\uff0c\u5de5\u4e4b\u6240\u5faa\u7528\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0d\u5341\u5168\u8005\uff0c\u7cbe\u795e\u4e0d\u5c08\uff0c\u5fd7\u610f\u4e0d\u7406\uff0c\u5916\u5167\u76f8\u5931\uff0c\u6545\u6642\u7591\u6b86\u3002\u8a3a\u4e0d\u77e5\u9670\u967d\u9006\u5f9e\u4e4b\u7406\uff0c\u6b64\u6cbb\u4e4b\u4e00\u5931\u77e3\u3002\u53d7\u5e2b\u4e0d\u5352\uff0c\u5984\u4f5c\u96dc\u8853\uff0c\u8b2c\u8a00\u70ba\u9053\uff0c\u66f4\u540d\u81ea\u529f\uff0c\u5984\u7528\u782d\u77f3\uff0c\u5f8c\u907a\u8eab\u548e\uff0c\u6b64\u6cbb\u4e4b\u4e8c\u5931\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u9069\u8ca7\u5bcc\u8cb4\u8ce4\u4e4b\u5c45\uff0c\u5750\u4e4b\u8584\u539a\uff0c\u5f62\u4e4b\u5bd2\u6eab\uff0c\u4e0d\u9069\u98f2\u98df\u4e4b\u5b9c\uff0c\u4e0d\u5225\u4eba\u4e4b\u52c7\u602f\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u6bd4\u985e\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u81ea\u4e82\uff0c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u81ea\u660e\uff0c\u6b64\u6cbb\u4e4b\u4e09\u5931\u4e5f\u3002\u8a3a\u75c5\u4e0d\u554f\u5176\u59cb\uff0c\u6182\u60a3\u98f2\u98df\u4e4b\u5931\u7bc0\uff0c\u8d77\u5c45\u4e4b\u904e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6216\u50b7\u65bc\u6bd2\uff0c\u4e0d\u5148\u8a00\u6b64\uff0c\u5352\u6301\u5bf8\u53e3\uff0c\u4f55\u75c5\u80fd\u4e2d\uff0c\u5984\u8a00\u4f5c\u540d\uff0c\u70ba\u7c97\u6240\u7aae\uff0c\u6b64\u6cbb\u4e4b\u56db\u5931\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u4e16\u4eba\u4e4b\u8a9e\u8005\uff0c\u99b3\u5343\u91cc\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u4e0d\u660e\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e4b\u8ad6\uff0c\u8a3a\u7121\u4eba\u4e8b\u3002\u6cbb\u6578\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u5f9e\u5bb9\u4e4b\u8446\uff0c\u5750\u6301\u5bf8\u53e3\uff0c\u8a3a\u4e0d\u4e2d\u4e94\u8108\uff0c\u767e\u75c5\u6240\u8d77\uff0c\u59cb\u4ee5\u81ea\u6028\uff0c\u907a\u5e2b\u5176\u548e\u3002\u662f\u6545\u6cbb\u4e0d\u80fd\u5faa\u7406\uff0c\u68c4\u8853\u65bc\u5e02\uff0c\u5984\u6cbb\u6642\u6108\uff0c\u611a\u5fc3\u81ea\u5f97\u3002\u55da\u547c\uff0c\u7a88\u7a88\u51a5\u51a5\uff0c\u719f\u77e5\u5176\u9053\u3002\u9053\u4e4b\u5927\u8005\uff0c\u64ec\u65bc\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u914d\u65bc\u56db\u6d77\uff0c\u6c5d\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4e4b\u8aed\u53d7\u4ee5\u660e\u70ba\u6666\u3002 Emperor Yellow in the Hall of Illumination, Master Thunder attended. Emperor Yellow asked: Your knowledge of the classics is profound, and your accomplishments numerous. Can you explain how you gained this knowledge and how you lost it? Master Thunder replied: Studying the canon and practicing the arts, all speak of perfection; if at any time one falls short or makes an error, I would like to hear about it to learn from my mistake. Emperor Yellow said: My child, your wisdom has not yet reached maturity; will you mix confused teachings? The classics on the channels and acupoints number twelve channels and 365 collateral vessels; these are well-known and widely used by practitioners. Why are they not all perfect? This is because the spirit is not focused, intentions are unclear, internal and external are out of harmony, leading to doubt and suspicion. If a physician does not understand the principles of yin and yang in diagnosing, this is one mistake. A teacher who does not practice diligently creates mixed treatments and speaks falsely about the way, claiming success for themselves and using oracles, leaving behind a legacy of error, resulting in a second mistake. Not adapting to the differing fortunes of the poor and wealthy, noble and humble, being inconsistent in treating the cold and warm, not suited to the appropriate diets and drinks, not knowing the classics, leading to self-confusion and unable to discern clarity, resulting in a third mistake. A physician who does not ask about the onset of an illness, worries about the patient's improper diet and excessive activity, perhaps causing harm with poisonous medicines, without first mentioning this, hastily prescribes a remedy, leading to confusion about the disease, speaking falsely as if in desperation, resulting in a fourth mistake. Therefore, the language of human beings is heard from afar, not understanding the reasoning behind measurements and prescriptions; medicine cannot be practiced by anyone. The path of treatment must come from a calm and tranquil state of mind, holding the needle with care, and not hitting the correct acupoints, with all diseases originating from this mistake. A hundred illnesses arise, and one begins to blame oneself, leaving behind a legacy of error for future generations. Thus, medicine cannot follow reason, abandoning its methods in despair, practicing falsely at times, with an ignorant heart that derives satisfaction. Alas! How deeply mysterious and profound, truly understanding the way is beyond my comprehension. I beseech you to make it clear for me so that I may understand</p>"},{"location":"79_huangdi-neijing_yin-yang-lei-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u9670\u967d\u985e\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u5b5f\u6625\u59cb\u81f3\uff0c\u9ec3\u5e1d\u71d5\u5750\uff0c\u81e8\u89c0\u516b\u6975\uff0c\u6b63\u516b\u98a8\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u800c\u554f\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u985e\uff0c\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u4e94\u4e2d\u6240\u4e3b\uff0c\u4f55\u85cf\u6700\u8cb4\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\uff0c\u7532\u4e59\u9752\uff0c\u4e2d\u4e3b\u809d\uff0c\u6cbb\u4e03\u5341\u4e8c\u65e5\uff0c\u662f\u8108\u4e4b\u4e3b\u6642\uff0c\u81e3\u4ee5\u5176\u85cf\u6700\u8cb4\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u537b\u5ff5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7d93\u9670\u967d\u5f9e\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b50\u6240\u8a00\u8cb4\uff0c\u6700\u5176\u4e0b\u4e5f\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u81f4\u9f4b\u4e03\u65e5\uff0c\u65e6\u5fa9\u4f8d\u5750\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u967d\u70ba\u7d93\uff0c\u4e8c\u967d\u70ba\u7dad\uff0c\u4e00\u967d\u70ba\u6e38\u90e8\uff0c\u6b64\u77e5\u4e94\u85cf\u7d42\u59cb\u3002\u4e09\u967d\u70ba\u8868\uff0c\u4e8c\u9670\u70ba\u88cf\uff0c\u4e00\u9670\u81f3\u7d55\u4f5c\u6714\u6666\uff0c\u537b\u5177\u5408\u4ee5\u6b63\u5176\u7406\u3002\u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u53d7\u696d\u672a\u80fd\u660e\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6240\u8b02\u4e09\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u70ba\u7d93\uff0c\u4e09\u967d\u8108\u81f3\u624b\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u5f26\u6d6e\u800c\u4e0d\u6c88\uff0c\u6c7a\u4ee5\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bdf\u4ee5\u5fc3\uff0c\u5408\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u8ad6\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u4e8c\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u4e5f\uff0c\u81f3\u624b\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u5f26\u800c\u6c88\u6025\u4e0d\u9f13\uff0c\u7085\u81f3\u4ee5\u75c5\u7686\u6b7b\u3002\u4e00\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u81f3\u624b\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u4e0a\u9023\u4eba\u8fce\u5f26\u6025\u61f8\u4e0d\u7d55\uff0c\u6b64\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u75c5\u4e5f\uff0c\u5c08\u9670\u5247\u6b7b\u3002\u4e09\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u516d\u7d93\u4e4b\u6240\u4e3b\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ea4\u65bc\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u4f0f\u9f13\u4e0d\u6d6e\uff0c\u4e0a\u7a7a\u5fd7\u5fc3\u3002\u4e8c\u9670\u81f3\u80ba\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u6b78\u8180\u80f1\uff0c\u5916\u9023\u813e\u80c3\u3002\u4e00\u9670\u7368\u81f3\uff0c\u7d93\u7d55\u6c23\u6d6e\u4e0d\u9f13\uff0c\u91e3\u800c\u6ed1\u3002\u6b64\u516d\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u4e4d\u9670\u4e4d\u967d\uff0c\u4ea4\u5c6c\u76f8\u5e76\uff0c\u7e46\u901a\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u5408\u65bc\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5148\u81f3\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u5f8c\u81f3\u70ba\u5ba2\u3002 Mengchun first arrived, the Yellow Emperor Yin sat, facing the observation of Ba J\u00ed, regulating the Qi of the eight winds, and asked Master Lao Gong: The patterns of yin and yang, the meridians' ways, the five centers' masters, what is most precious in concealment? Lao Gong answered: Spring, jia and bing green, governs the liver, treats the seventy-two days, it is the time of the meridian, so I regard its concealment as most precious. The Emperor said: I suddenly think of the upper and lower journeys of yin and yang, what you said is valuable, most respected below. Lao Gong kowtowed for seven days, then served again at dawn. The Emperor said: Three yangs are the channel, two yangs are the mantle, one yang is the wandering department, this knows the five orifices beginning and end. Three yangs are the skin, two yin are the lungs, deep and urgent not resonating, when it reaches, all diseases will die. One yang is the shallow yang, at the hand Taiyang, rising and not sinking, deciding by measure, understanding by heart, combining yin and yang's reasoning. Two yangs are the Yang Ming, at the hand Taiyang, resonating and sinking urgent not resonating, when it reaches, all diseases will die. One yang is the Shao Yang, at the hand Taiyang, rising and connecting people's greeting string urgent not cut off, this is Shao Yang's disease, then there is interior. Three yin are the master of the six meridians, unite in the Taiyang, hide the drum without floating, aiming at the heart spirit. Two yins arrive at the lungs, their qi returns to the bladder, outer connecting spleen and stomach. One yin alone arrives, the meridian's qi floats without resonating, hangs and slides. These six meridians, alternately yin and yang, intertwine and overlap, link the five orifices, combine in yin and yang, begin as master, end as guest.</p> <p>2: \u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u81e3\u6089\u76e1\u610f\uff0c\u53d7\u50b3\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u980c\u5f97\u5f9e\u5bb9\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u4ee5\u5408\u5f9e\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u96cc\u96c4\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u967d\u70ba\u7236\uff0c\u4e8c\u967d\u70ba\u885b\uff0c\u4e00\u967d\u70ba\u7d00\u3002\u4e09\u9670\u70ba\u6bcd\uff0c\u4e8c\u9670\u70ba\u96cc\uff0c\u4e00\u9670\u70ba\u7368\u4f7f\u3002\u4e8c\u967d\u4e00\u9670\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u4e3b\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u52dd\u4e00\u9670\uff0c\u800e\u800c\u52d5\uff0c\u4e5d\u7ac5\u7686\u6c88\u3002\u4e09\u967d\u4e00\u9670\uff0c\u592a\u967d\u8108\u52dd\uff0c\u4e00\u9670\u4e0d\u80fd\u6b62\uff0c\u5167\u4e82\u4e94\u85cf\uff0c\u5916\u70ba\u9a5a\u99ed\u3002\u4e8c\u9670\u4e8c\u967d\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u80ba\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u8108\u6c88\uff0c\u52dd\u80ba\u50b7\u813e\uff0c\u5916\u50b7\u56db\u652f\u3002\u4e8c\u9670\u4e8c\u967d\u7686\u4ea4\u81f3\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u814e\uff0c\u7f75\u8a48\u5984\u884c\uff0c\u5dd4\u75be\u70ba\u72c2\u3002\u4e8c\u9670\u4e00\u967d\uff0c\u75c5\u51fa\u65bc\u814e\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u5ba2\u904a\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u8118\u4e0b\u7a7a\u7ac5\uff0c\u5824\u9589\u585e\u4e0d\u901a\uff0c\u56db\u652f\u5225\u96e2\u3002\u4e00\u9670\u4e00\u967d\u4ee3\u7d55\uff0c\u6b64\u9670\u6c23\u81f3\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u7121\u5e38\uff0c\u51fa\u5165\u4e0d\u77e5\uff0c\u5589\u54bd\u4e7e\u71e5\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u571f\u813e\u3002\u4e8c\u967d\u4e09\u9670\uff0c\u81f3\u9670\u7686\u5728\uff0c\u9670\u4e0d\u904e\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u4e0d\u80fd\u6b62\u9670\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e26\u7d55\uff0c\u6d6e\u70ba\u8840\u7615\uff0c\u6c88\u70ba\u81bf\u80d5\u3002\u9670\u967d\u7686\u58ef\uff0c\u4e0b\u81f3\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u4e0a\u5408\u662d\u662d\uff0c\u4e0b\u5408\u51a5\u51a5\uff0c\u8a3a\u6c7a\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u671f\uff0c\u9042\u5408\u6b72\u9996\u3002 Lei Gong said: I fully understand the intention, receive the transmissions of the classics and the pulse, praise the Way of serenity, harmonize with serenity, not knowing yin and yang. The Emperor said: Three Yang is the father, two Yang is defense, one Yang is record. Three Yin is the mother, two Yin is yin, one Yin is independent officer. Two Yang and one Yin, Yang Ming governs disease, unable to overcome one Yin, trembling and moving, all nine orifices sink. Three Yang and one Yin, Tai Yang pulse prevails, one Yin cannot stop, internal chaos of the five organs, external is fear. Two Yin two Yang, disease in the lungs, small Yin pulse sinking, superior lung hurts liver, external harm the limbs. Two Yin two Yang all meet at, disease in the kidneys, shouting, madness. Two Yin one Yang, disease from the kidneys, yin qi wandering in the heart, hollowness in the lower abdomen, dam blocked and closed, limbs scattered.

The Emperor said no. Master L\u00e1i asked again, In the classic texts, what is the short term? The Emperor said, The illness of the three months of winter, which affects the Yang aspect, will show signs of death in the month of spring when the pulse indicates danger; these will all recover by the beginning of spring. In the case of the three months of winter's illness, the principles are complete, and the grass and willows will all be killed, while in spring the Yin and Yang will both be cut off, and the prognosis is in the vernal equinox. The illness of the three months of spring, known as the Yang killing, will have both the Yin and Yang cut off, and the prognosis will be at the withering stage. The illness of the three months of summer, if the Yin does not last beyond ten days, will have the Yin and Yang balanced, and the prognosis will be at the flooding stage. The illness of the three months of autumn, when all three Yangs rise but cannot be treated, will have a prognosis by itself. If the Yin and Yang are combined and cannot sit down, they cannot get up; if three Yangs arise alone, the prognosis is at the stone-water stage. If two Yins arise alone, the prognosis is at the flood stage.</p>"},{"location":"7_huangdi-neijing_yin-yang-bie-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u9670\u967d\u5225\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u4eba\u6709\u56db\u7d93\u5341\u4e8c\u5f9e\uff0c\u4f55\u8b02\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u56db\u7d93\u61c9\u56db\u6642\uff0c\u5341\u4e8c\u5f9e\u61c9\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\uff0c\u5341\u4e8c\u6708\u61c9\u5341\u4e8c\u8108\u3002\u8108\u6709\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u77e5\u967d\u8005\u77e5\u9670\uff0c\u77e5\u9670\u8005\u77e5\u967d\u3002\u51e1\u967d\u6709\u4e94\uff0c\u4e94\u4e94\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u967d\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u771f\u85cf\u4e5f\uff0c\u898b\u5247\u70ba\u6557\uff0c\u6557\u5fc5\u6b7b\u4e5f\uff1b\u6240\u8b02\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u80c3\u8118\u4e4b\u967d\u4e5f\u3002\u5225\u65bc\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u75c5\u8655\u4e5f\uff1b\u5225\u65bc\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u671f\u3002\u4e09\u967d\u5728\u982d\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u5728\u624b\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u4e00\u4e5f\u3002\u5225\u65bc\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u75c5\u5fcc\u6642\uff1b\u5225\u65bc\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u6b7b\u751f\u4e4b\u671f\u3002\u8b39\u719f\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u7121\u8207\u773e\u8b00\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u9670\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u53bb\u8005\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u81f3\u8005\u70ba\u967d\uff1b\u975c\u8005\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u52d5\u8005\u70ba\u967d\uff1b\u9072\u8005\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u6578\u8005\u70ba\u967d\u3002\u51e1\u6301\u771f\u8108\u4e4b\u85cf\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u809d\u81f3\u61f8\u7d55\u6025\uff0c\u5341\u516b\u65e5\u6b7b\uff1b\u5fc3\u81f3\u61f8\u7d55\uff0c\u4e5d\u65e5\u6b7b\uff1b\u80ba\u81f3\u61f8\u7d55\uff0c\u5341\u4e8c\u65e5\u6b7b\uff1b\u814e\u81f3\u61f8\u7d55\uff0c\u4e03\u65e5\u6b7b\uff1b\u813e\u81f3\u61f8\u7d55\uff0c\u56db\u65e5\u6b7b\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked, What are the four canons and twelve branches? The Duke replied, The four canons correspond to the four seasons, and the twelve branches correspond to the twelve months. The twelve months correspond to the twelve pulses. The pulse has yin and yang; one who knows yang knows yin, and one who knows yin knows yang. All in all, there are five aspects of yang; five times five equals 25 yang. So-called yin refers to the true storehouse; if it is seen, it means failure, and failure must lead to death. The so-called yang refers to the yang of the abdomen and lumbar region. By distinguishing yang, one knows where the disease lies; by distinguishing yin, one knows the time of life and death. Three yangs are in the head, three yins are in the hand; so-called all is one. By distinguishing yang, one knows the taboo times of disease; by distinguishing yin, one knows the time of life and death. Be careful with yin and yang, without rivaling with the masses. The so-called yin and yang: what goes is yin, what arrives is yang; quietness is yin, motion is yang; slowness is yin, speed is yang. Those who practice the true pulse, if the liver is too full or too urgent, they will die in 18 days; if the heart is too full or too urgent, they will die in nine days; if the lung is too full or too urgent, they will die in 12 days; if the kidney is too full or too urgent, they will die in seven days; if the spleen is too full or too urgent, they will die in four days.</p> <p>2: \u66f0\uff1a\u4e8c\u967d\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u767c\u5fc3\u813e\uff0c\u6709\u4e0d\u5f97\u96b1\u66f2\uff0c\u5973\u5b50\u4e0d\u6708\uff1b\u5176\u50b3\u70ba\u98a8\u6d88\uff0c\u5176\u50b3\u70ba\u606f\u8cc1\u8005\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\u3002\u66f0\uff1a\u4e09\u967d\u70ba\u75c5\uff0c\u767c\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u4e0b\u70ba\u7670\u816b\uff0c\u53ca\u70ba\u75ff\u53a5\u8168\u3f93\uff1b\u5176\u50b3\u70ba\u7d22\u6fa4\uff0c\u5176\u50b3\u70ba\u9839\u759d\u3002\u66f0\uff1a\u4e00\u967d\u767c\u75c5\uff0c\u5c11\u6c23\u5584\u6b2c\u5584\u6cc4\uff1b\u5176\u50b3\u70ba\u5fc3\u63a3\uff0c\u5176\u50b3\u70ba\u9694\u3002\u4e8c\u967d\u4e00\u9670\u767c\u75c5\uff0c\u4e3b\u9a5a\u99ed\u80cc\u75db\uff0c\u5584\u566b\u5584\u6b20\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u98a8\u53a5\u3002\u4e8c\u9670\u4e00\u967d\u767c\u75c5\uff0c\u5584\u8139\u5fc3\u6eff\u5584\u6c23\u3002\u4e09\u967d\u4e09\u9670\u767c\u75c5\uff0c\u70ba\u504f\u67af\u75ff\u6613\uff0c\u56db\u652f\u4e0d\u8209\u3002 It is said: Diseases of the yang qi result in heart palpitations, affecting the spleen. If it does not hide and bend (the qi), a woman will not menstruate. Its transmission results in a wind that dissipates, or a disease caused by exhausting vitality, leading to death without cure. It is said: Diseases of three yang manifest as cold and heat, with the symptoms of boils and edema below, and also numbness and paralysis. Its transmission results in the loss of essence, its transmission results in piles. It is said: If one yang manifests a disease, it causes shortness of breath and sighing, and the discharge of fluids; its transmission results in constriction of the heart, and its transmission results in separation. Diseases of both yin and yang occur when shocked and experiencing back pain, causing hiccups and belching, and are known as wind stroke. If both yin and yang manifest diseases, it causes limbs that are weak, stiff, and easily paralyzed.</p> <p>3: \u9f13\u4e00\u967d\u66f0\u9264\uff0c\u9f13\u4e00\u9670\u66f0\u6bdb\uff0c\u9f13\u967d\u52dd\u6025\u66f0\u7d43\uff0c\u9f13\u967d\u81f3\u800c\u7d55\u66f0\u77f3\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u904e\u66f0\u6e9c\u3002\u9670\u722d\u65bc\u5167\uff0c\u967d\u64fe\u65bc\u5916\uff0c\u9b44\u6c57\u672a\u85cf\uff0c\u56db\u9006\u800c\u8d77\uff0c\u8d77\u5247\u718f\u80ba\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u5598\u9cf4\u3002\u9670\u4e4b\u6240\u751f\uff0c\u548c\u672c\u66f0\u548c\u3002\u662f\u6545\u525b\u8207\u525b\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u7834\u6563\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u4e43\u6d88\u4ea1\u3002\u6dd6\u5247\u525b\u67d4\u4e0d\u548c\uff0c\u7d93\u6c23\u4e43\u7d55\u3002\u6b7b\u9670\u4e4b\u5c6c\uff0c\u4e0d\u904e\u4e09\u65e5\u800c\u6b7b\uff1b\u751f\u967d\u4e4b\u5c6c\uff0c\u4e0d\u904e\u56db\u65e5\u800c\u6b7b\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u751f\u967d\u6b7b\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u809d\u4e4b\u5fc3\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u751f\u967d\u3002\u5fc3\u4e4b\u80ba\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u6b7b\u9670\u3002\u80ba\u4e4b\u814e\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u91cd\u9670\u3002\u814e\u4e4b\u813e\uff0c\u8b02\u4e4b\u8f9f\u9670\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\u3002\u7d50\u967d\u8005\uff0c\u816b\u56db\u652f\u3002\u7d50\u9670\u8005\u4fbf\u8840\u4e00\u5347\uff0c\u518d\u7d50\u4e8c\u5347\uff0c\u4e09\u7d50\u4e09\u5347\u3002\u9670\u967d\u7d50\u659c\uff0c\u591a\u9670\u5c11\u967d\u66f0\u77f3\u6c34\uff0c\u5c11\u8179\u816b\u3002\u4e8c\u967d\u7d50\u8b02\u4e4b\u6d88\uff0c\u4e09\u967d\u7d50\u8b02\u4e4b\u9694\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u7d50\u8b02\u4e4b\u6c34\uff0c\u4e00\u9670\u4e00\u967d\u7d50\u8b02\u4e4b\u5589\u75fa\u3002\u9670\u640f\u967d\u5225\u8b02\u4e4b\u6709\u5b50\u3002\u9670\u967d\u865b\u8178\u8f9f\u6b7b\u3002\u967d\u52a0\u65bc\u9670\u8b02\u4e4b\u6c57\u3002\u9670\u865b\u967d\u640f\u8b02\u4e4b\u5d29\u3002\u4e09\u9670\u4ff1\u640f\uff0c\u4e8c\u5341\u65e5\u591c\u534a\u6b7b\u3002\u4e8c\u9670\u4ff1\u640f\uff0c\u5341\u4e09\u65e5\u5915\u6642\u6b7b\u3002\u4e00\u9670\u4ff1\u640f\uff0c\u5341\u65e5\u6b7b\u3002\u4e09\u967d\u4ff1\u640f\u4e14\u9f13\uff0c\u4e09\u65e5\u6b7b\u3002\u4e09\u9670\u4e09\u967d\u4ff1\u640f\uff0c\u5fc3\u8179\u6eff\u3002\u767c\u76e1\u4e0d\u5f97\u96b1\u66f2\uff0c\u4e94\u65e5\u6b7b\u3002\u4e8c\u967d\u4ff1\u640f\uff0c\u5176\u75c5\u6eab\uff0c\u6b7b\u4e0d\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0d\u904e\u5341\u65e5\u6b7b\u3002 The Yang and Yin of the drum are said to be hooks, and the Yang and Yin of the whip are said to be strings. When Yang surpasses Yin in haste, it is called stone; when Yin surpasses Yang in crossing over, it is called stream. Inside Yin fights, outside Yang disturbs. The soul sweat has not yet settled, and the four reversals arise. If they arise, they will scorch the lungs, causing the person to pant heavily. What is born from Yin is said to be harmony. Therefore, firmness and softness are compatible; the vital energy is Yang and the Yin energy will disappear. If it becomes murky, firmness and softness will not be compatible, and the channel energy will cease. Those who die from excess Yin do not survive more than three days; those who die from excess Yang do not survive more than four days. What is called dying of Yang and living on Yin is the heart of the liver. The lungs are said to be the dead Yin of the heart. The kidneys are said to be heavy Yin. The spleen is said to be dispersing Yin, and if it dies it cannot be saved. Swelling resulting from excess Yang is called results. Excess Yin is manifested by a rise in clear fluid; once it rises twice, it becomes three folds. Yang and Yin are unevenly distributed, and this is called jade water, with more Yin and less Yang. Two Yang coming together are said to dissipate. Three Yang coming together are said to be isolated. Three Yin coming together are said to be water. Two Yins coming together are said to choke. One Yin and one Yang coming together are said to paralyze the throat. Vacuity of Yin and excess Yang is called having a son. The vacuity of Yin and Yang will cause death of the intestines. Excess Yang accompanied by pounding is called sweat. Vacuity of Yang and Yin pounding is called collapse. All three Yins together, within twenty days and half a day, will die. All two Yins together, within thirteen days at dusk, will die. All one Yin together, within ten days, will die. Excess Yangs coming together and drumming is called death in three days. Excess Yang and excess Yin together, with the abdomen full, unable to hide the manifestation, will die within five days. Those who die from excessive Yin cannot be saved; this disease will not last more than ten days.</p>"},{"location":"80_huangdi-neijing_fang-sheng-shuai-lun_zh_translated/","title":"\u65b9\u76db\u8870\u8ad6","text":"<p>1: \u96f7\u516c\u8acb\u554f\u6c23\u4e4b\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u4f55\u8005\u70ba\u9006\uff0c\u4f55\u8005\u70ba\u5f9e\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u8345\u66f0\uff1a\u967d\u5f9e\u5de6\uff0c\u9670\u5f9e\u53f3\uff0c\u8001\u5f9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c11\u5f9e\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u6625\u590f\u6b78\u967d\u70ba\u751f\uff0c\u6b78\u79cb\u51ac\u70ba\u6b7b\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5247\u6b78\u79cb\u51ac\u70ba\u751f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u6c23\u591a\u5c11\u9006\u7686\u70ba\u53a5\u3002\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u9918\u8005\u53a5\u8036\u3002\u8345\u66f0\uff1a\u4e00\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bd2\u53a5\u5230\u819d\uff0c\u5c11\u8005\u79cb\u51ac\u6b7b\uff0c\u8001\u8005\u79cb\u51ac\u751f\u3002\u6c23\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u982d\u75db\u5dd4\u75be\uff0c\u6c42\u967d\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u6c42\u9670\u4e0d\u5be9\uff0c\u4e94\u90e8\u9694\u7121\u5fb5\uff0c\u82e5\u5c45\u66e0\u91ce\uff0c\u82e5\u4f0f\u7a7a\u5ba4\uff0c\u7ddc\u7ddc\u4e4e\u5c6c\u4e0d\u6eff\u65e5\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u5c11\u6c23\u4e4b\u53a5\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5984\u5922\u5176\u6975\u81f3\u8ff7\u3002\u4e09\u967d\u7d55\uff0c\u4e09\u9670\u5fae\uff0c\u662f\u70ba\u5c11\u6c23\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u80ba\u6c23\u865b\u5247\u4f7f\u4eba\u5922\u898b\u767d\u7269\uff0c\u898b\u4eba\u65ac\u8840\u85c9\u85c9\uff0c\u5f97\u5176\u6642\u5247\u5922\u898b\u5175\u6230\u3002\u814e\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u5247\u4f7f\u4eba\u5922\u898b\u821f\u8239\u6eba\u4eba\uff0c\u5f97\u5176\u6642\uff0c\u5247\u5922\u4f0f\u6c34\u4e2d\u82e5\u6709\u754f\u6050\u3002\u809d\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u5247\u5922\u898b\u83cc\u9999\u751f\u8349\uff0c\u5f97\u5176\u6642\uff0c\u5247\u5922\u4f0f\u6a39\u4e0b\u4e0d\u6562\u8d77\u3002\u5fc3\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u5247\u5922\u6551\u706b\u967d\u7269\uff0c\u5f97\u5176\u6642\uff0c\u5247\u5922\u71d4\u707c\u3002\u813e\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u5247\u5922\u98f2\u98df\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f97\u5176\u6642\uff0c\u5247\u5922\u7bc9\u57a3\u84cb\u5c4b\u3002\u6b64\u7686\u4e94\u85cf\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5408\u4e4b\u4e94\u8a3a\uff0c\u8abf\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u7d93\u8108\u3002 Leigong asked about the abundance of Qi, what is reversed and what follows. The Yellow Emperor said: Yang follows to the left, Yin follows to the right, oldness follows above, youngness follows below. Therefore, in spring and summer, there is generation through Yang, and in autumn and winter, there is death through Yin. Reversed, it would be generation in autumn and winter, and that is why the abundance of Qi is excessive and leads to illness. Ask: If there is a surplus, is it an illness? The Yellow Emperor said: One who does not descend below, cold illness reaches the knees, young people die in autumn and winter, and old people live in autumn and winter. Qi does not descend, causing headache and dizziness, seeking Yang but not getting it, seeking Yin but not discerning it, the five organs are isolated without signs, whether living in sparse wilderness or hiding in empty rooms, they all belong to not having enough sunlight. Therefore, the deficient Qi causes people to have delusions of extreme situations. Three Yangs and three Yins vanish, and this is deficient Qi. Therefore, when Lung Qi is empty, it makes people dream of seeing white things, dream of seeing people cutting blood vessels, if one catches the time, then dreaming of seeing warfare. Kidney Qi being empty causes dreams of drowning people, catching the time, then dreaming of being afraid and dreading in water. Liver Qi being empty causes dreams of seeing weeds growing from grass, catching the time, then dreaming of hiding under trees and not daring to get up. Heart Qi being empty causes dreams of rescuing fire Yang things, catching the time, then dreaming of burning. Spleen Qi being empty causes dreams of insufficient food and drink, catching the time, then dreaming of building walls and roofs. All these are the five organs' deficient Qi, Yang Qi having a surplus, and Yin Qi not enough. Merge the five diagnoses, regulate Yin and Yang, it is in the meridians and vessels.</p> <p>2: \u8a3a\u6709\u5341\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ea6\u4eba\u8108\u5ea6\uff0c\u85cf\u5ea6\uff0c\u8089\u5ea6\uff0c\u7b4b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4fde\u5ea6\u3002\u9670\u967d\u6c23\u76e1\uff0c\u4eba\u75c5\u81ea\u5177\u3002\u8108\u52d5\u7121\u5e38\uff0c\u6563\u9670\u9817\u967d\uff0c\u8108\u812b\u4e0d\u5177\uff0c\u8a3a\u7121\u5e38\u884c\uff0c\u8a3a\u5fc5\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ea6\u6c11\u541b\u537f\uff0c\u53d7\u5e2b\u4e0d\u5352\uff0c\u4f7f\u8853\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bdf\u9006\u5f9e\uff0c\u662f\u70ba\u5984\u884c\uff0c\u6301\u96cc\u5931\u96c4\uff0c\u68c4\u9670\u9644\u967d\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u5e76\u5408\uff0c\u8a3a\u6545\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u50b3\u4e4b\u5f8c\u4e16\uff0c\u53cd\u8ad6\u81ea\u7ae0\u3002\u81f3\u9670\u865b\uff0c\u5929\u6c23\u7d55\uff0c\u81f3\u967d\u76db\uff0c\u5730\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9670\u967d\u4e26\u4ea4\uff0c\u81f3\u4eba\u4e4b\u6240\u884c\u3002\u9670\u967d\u4e26\u4ea4\u8005\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u5148\u81f3\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u5f8c\u81f3\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u8056\u4eba\u6301\u8a3a\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u5148\u5f8c\u9670\u967d\u800c\u6301\u4e4b\uff0c\u5947\u6052\u4e4b\u52e2\u4e43\u516d\u5341\u9996\uff0c\u8a3a\u5408\u5fae\u4e4b\u4e8b\uff0c\u8ffd\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u7ae0\u4e94\u4e2d\u4e4b\u60c5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e4b\u8ad6\uff0c\u53d6\u865b\u5be6\u4e4b\u8981\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e94\u5ea6\u4e4b\u4e8b\uff0c\u77e5\u6b64\u4e43\u8db3\u4ee5\u8a3a\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u5207\u9670\u4e0d\u5f97\u967d\uff0c\u8a3a\u6d88\u4ea1\uff0c\u5f97\u967d\u4e0d\u5f97\u9670\uff0c\u5b88\u5b78\u4e0d\u6e5b\uff0c\u77e5\u5de6\u4e0d\u77e5\u53f3\uff0c\u77e5\u53f3\u4e0d\u77e5\u5de6\uff0c\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0b\uff0c\u77e5\u5148\u4e0d\u77e5\u5f8c\uff0c\u6545\u6cbb\u4e0d\u4e45\u3002\u77e5\u919c\u77e5\u5584\uff0c\u77e5\u75c5\u77e5\u4e0d\u75c5\uff0c\u77e5\u9ad8\u77e5\u4e0b\uff0c\u77e5\u5750\u77e5\u8d77\uff0c\u77e5\u884c\u77e5\u6b62\uff0c\u7528\u4e4b\u6709\u7d00\uff0c\u8a3a\u9053\u4e43\u5177\uff0c\u842c\u4e16\u4e0d\u6b86\u3002\u8d77\u6240\u6709\u9918\uff0c\u77e5\u6240\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5ea6\u4e8b\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u8108\u4e8b\u56e0\u683c\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u5f62\u5f31\u6c23\u865b\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u5f62\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u8108\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6b7b\u3002\u8108\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u5f62\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u751f\u3002 Diagnosis in ten degrees, degree the pulse, degree the person's pulse, degree hidden, degree flesh, degree tendons, degree joint. Balanced yin and yang, and the person is sick by himself. Irregular pulse movement, scattering yin and solid yang, the pulse does not have a possession, diagnosis is not constant, diagnosis must be above and below, diagnosing the common people, officials and ministers, receiving teachers not dying, using techniques not clear, not discerning obeying and disobeying, this is called wrong actions, holding female losing male, abandoning yin attaching yang, not knowing blending and merging, diagnostic principles do not understand, pass it down to future generations, and debate from themselves. When yin is empty, heavenly spirit disappears, when yang is strong, earthly spirit does not suffice. Yin and yang blend, at people's actions. Whoever blends yin and yang, yang qi first arrives, and yin qi follows. Therefore, sages holding the diagnostic art, first and last yin and yang, and hold them. The mysterious power of six tens is complete, knowing the merging of micro-diagnostic events, following the changes of yin and yang, mastering five degrees' affairs, knowing this suffices for diagnosis. Therefore, do not cut yin and get yang, and diagnostic disappears. Do not get yin and guard academic studies, know left but not right, know right but not left, know up but not down, know before but not after, therefore treatment does not last long. Know ugly knows good, knows disease knows not disease, knows high knows low, knows sitting knows standing, knows stopping knows moving, using it has a record, diagnostic way is complete, endless throughout the ages. Starting from all remnants, knowing what is lacking. Degree affairs up and down, pulse events due to format. Therefore, weak form and empty spirit, die. Form spirit has remaining pulse qi does not suffice, die. Pulse qi has remaining form spirit does not suffice, live.</p> <p>3: \u662f\u4ee5\u8a3a\u6709\u5927\u65b9\uff0c\u5750\u8d77\u6709\u5e38\uff0c\u51fa\u5165\u6709\u884c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f49\u795e\u660e\uff0c\u5fc5\u6e05\u5fc5\u6de8\uff0c\u4e0a\u89c0\u4e0b\u89c0\uff0c\u53f8\u516b\u6b63\u90aa\uff0c\u5225\u4e94\u4e2d\u90e8\uff0c\u6309\u8108\u52d5\u975c\uff0c\u5faa\u5c3a\u6ed1\u6fc7\uff0c\u5bd2\u6eab\u4e4b\u610f\uff0c\u8996\u5176\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5408\u4e4b\u75c5\u80fd\uff0c\u9006\u5f9e\u4ee5\u5f97\uff0c\u5fa9\u77e5\u75c5\u540d\uff0c\u8a3a\u53ef\u5341\u5168\uff0c\u4e0d\u5931\u4eba\u60c5\uff0c\u6545\u8a3a\u4e4b\u6216\u8996\u606f\u8996\u610f\uff0c\u6545\u4e0d\u5931\u689d\u7406\uff0c\u9053\u751a\u660e\u5bdf\uff0c\u6545\u80fd\u9577\u4e45\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u6b64\u9053\uff0c\u5931\u7d93\u7d55\u7406\uff0c\u4ea1\u8a00\u5984\u671f\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u5931\u9053\u3002 Therefore, being able to diagnose means understanding the large and small methods, sitting up having a routine, coming and going having a path, converting the spirit and mind, being certain to be clear and pure, observing the upper and lower, regulating yin and yang, differentiating the five zang organs, palpating the pulse and stillness, following the changes of cold and heat, seeing their degree, combining them, and being able to cure diseases according to their reversal, they know the disease's name, diagnosis can be perfected in ten aspects, not losing human feelings. For this reason, when diagnosing, one should look at both breath and mind. Therefore, it is not lost in reasoning. The way is very clear and accurate, so it can last for a long time.

There may be sages who are not inferior. As for the question of why some people can easily grasp this classic while others cannot, it is due to differences in their social status, and the physical forms of people come from this as well.

These are techniques that craftsmen know and principles that arise from the Dao.</p> <p>2: \u592b\u5fc3\u8005\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u4e4b\u5c08\u7cbe\u4e5f\uff0c\u76ee\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u7ac5\u4e5f\uff0c\u83ef\u8272\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u69ae\u4e5f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u4eba\u6709\u5fb7\u4e5f\uff0c\u5247\u6c23\u548c\u65bc\u76ee\uff0c\u6709\u4ea1\uff0c\u6182\u77e5\u65bc\u8272\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u60b2\u54c0\u5247\u6ce3\u4e0b\uff0c\u6ce3\u4e0b\u6c34\u6240\u7531\u751f\u3002\u6c34\u5b97\u8005\uff0c\u7a4d\u6c34\u4e5f\uff0c\u7a4d\u6c34\u8005\uff0c\u81f3\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u81f3\u9670\u8005\uff0c\u814e\u4e4b\u7cbe\u4e5f\u3002\u5b97\u7cbe\u4e4b\u6c34\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0d\u51fa\u8005\uff0c\u662f\u7cbe\u6301\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u8f14\u4e4b\u88f9\u4e4b\uff0c\u6545\u6c34\u4e0d\u884c\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u6c34\u4e4b\u7cbe\u70ba\u5fd7\uff0c\u706b\u4e4b\u7cbe\u70ba\u795e\uff0c\u6c34\u706b\u76f8\u611f\uff0c\u795e\u5fd7\u4ff1\u60b2\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u76ee\u4e4b\u6c34\u751f\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u8afa\u8a00\u66f0\uff1a\u5fc3\u60b2\u540d\u66f0\u5fd7\u60b2\uff0c\u5fd7\u8207\u5fc3\u7cbe\uff0c\u5171\u6e4a\u65bc\u76ee\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u4ff1\u60b2\u5247\u795e\u6c23\u50b3\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u7cbe\u4e0a\u4e0d\u50b3\u65bc\u5fd7\uff0c\u800c\u5fd7\u7368\u60b2\uff0c\u6545\u6ce3\u51fa\u4e5f\u3002 The heart is the essence of the five organs, the eyes are their orifices, and the radiant color is their glory. Thus, when a person has virtue, the qi harmonizes with the eyes, and there is no sorrow and knowledge of color. Therefore, when sadness and grief arise, one cries and sheds tears. The water that arises from crying is due to the accumulation of water. Accumulated water is the ultimate yin, and the ultimate yin is the essence of the kidneys. The essence of the kidneys gives rise to water, which does not go out because it is held firmly in place. It is wrapped and contained, so the water does not move. The essence of water gives rise to intention, and the essence of fire gives rise to spirit. Water and fire mutually inform each other, and both intention and spirit are sorrowful, giving rise to the watery tears of the eyes. Hence, there is a saying: The heart's sadness is called intention, and intention and the heart's essence blend together in the eyes. Therefore, when both are sorrowful, the vital qi flows to the heart, and the essence does not rise to the intention, while the intention alone is sorrowful, and this causes tears to flow out.</p> <p>3: \u6ce3\u6d95\u8005\uff0c\u8166\u4e5f\uff0c\u8166\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u4e5f\uff0c\u9ad3\u8005\uff0c\u9aa8\u4e4b\u5145\u4e5f\uff0c\u6545\u8166\u6ef2\u70ba\u6d95\u3002\u5fd7\u8005\uff0c\u9aa8\u4e4b\u4e3b\u4e5f\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u6c34\u6d41\u800c\u6d95\u5f9e\u4e4b\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u985e\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u6d95\u4e4b\u8207\u6ce3\u8005\uff0c\u8b6c\u5982\u4eba\u4e4b\u5144\u5f1f\uff0c\u6025\u5247\u4ff1\u6b7b\uff0c\u751f\u5247\u4ff1\u751f\uff0c\u5176\u5fd7\u4ee5\u65e9\u60b2\uff0c\u662f\u4ee5\u6d95\u6ce3\u4ff1\u51fa\u800c\u6a6b\u884c\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u4eba\u6d95\u6ce3\u4ff1\u51fa\u800c\u76f8\u5f9e\u8005\uff0c\u6240\u5c6c\u4e4b\u985e\u4e5f\u3002 Those who weep and shed tears, it is due to the brain. The brain is yin energy, and the marrow fills the bones. Thus, when the brain is filled with water, tears flow forth. The will, residing in the bones, causes the water to flow and produces tears. Comparing tears and weeping to brothers, if they are hurried, both will die; if they live, both will live. Their shared desire for early grief leads tears and weeping to come out together and run horizontally. Those who weep and produce tears following one another, share the same category.</p> <p>4: \u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u5927\u77e3\uff01\u8acb\u554f\u4eba\u54ed\u6ce3\u800c\u6dda\u4e0d\u51fa\u8005\uff0c\u82e5\u51fa\u800c\u5c11\u6d95\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f9e\u4e4b\u4f55\u4e5f\uff1f\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u6ce3\u4e0d\u51fa\u8005\uff0c\u54ed\u4e0d\u60b2\u4e5f\uff1b\u4e0d\u6ce3\u8005\uff0c\u795e\u4e0d\u6148\u4e5f\u3002\u795e\u4e0d\u6148\u5247\u5fd7\u4e0d\u60b2\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u6301\uff0c\u6ce3\u5b89\u80fd\u7368\u4f86\uff1f\u592b\u5fd7\u60b2\u8005\u60cb\uff0c\u60cb\u5247\u6c96\u9670\uff0c\u6c96\u9670\u5247\u5fd7\u53bb\u76ee\uff0c\u5fd7\u53bb\u5247\u795e\u4e0d\u5b88\u7cbe\uff0c\u7cbe\u795e\u53bb\u76ee\uff0c\u6d95\u6ce3\u51fa\u4e5f\u3002\u4e14\u5b50\u7368\u4e0d\u8aa6\u4e0d\u5ff5\u592b\u7d93\u8a00\u4e4e\uff1f\u53a5\u5247\u76ee\u7121\u6240\u898b\uff0c\u592b\u4eba\u53a5\u5247\u967d\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\uff0c\u9670\u6c23\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0b\u3002\u967d\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0a\u5247\u706b\u71ed\u5149\u4e5f\uff0c\u9670\u5e76\u65bc\u4e0b\u5247\u8db3\u5bd2\uff0c\u8db3\u5bd2\u5247\u8139\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u4e00\u6c34\u4e0d\u52dd\u4e94\u706b\uff0c\u6545\u76ee\u7725\u76f2\u3002\u662f\u4ee5\u885d\u98a8\uff0c\u6ce3\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0d\u6b62\u3002\u592b\u98a8\u4e4b\u4e2d\u76ee\u4e5f\uff0c\u967d\u6c23\u5167\u5b88\u65bc\u7cbe\uff0c\u662f\u706b\u6c23\u71d4\u76ee\uff0c\u6545\u898b\u98a8\u5247\u6ce3\u4e0b\u4e5f\u3002\u6709\u4ee5\u6bd4\u4e4b\uff0c\u592b\u706b\u75be\u98a8\u751f\uff0c\u4e43\u80fd\u96e8\uff0c\u6b64\u4e4b\u985e\u4e5f\u3002 Lei Gong said: Great indeed! The emperor asked, If a person weeps but the tears do not come out, and if they come out but are insufficient, why are they not in accord with this principle? The emperor replied: Weeping that does not produce tears is not mourning; not weeping shows that the spirit is not compassionate. If the spirit is not compassionate, then the will is not sorrowful. Yin and Yang balance each other; how can weeping come out on its own? The will is sorrowful, causing a leak of Yin, which leads to the loss of the will, causing the spirit not to guard the spirit-stuff, and the spirit-stuff goes out with the tears. Moreover, Confucius, you alone do not recite or think on the Classics? When the person is exhausted, the eyes have nothing to see; when a woman is exhausted, Yang-qi is concentrated above and Yin-qi below. When Yang is concentrated above, there is light from the fire torch; when Yin is concentrated below, there is coldness in the feet, which causes swelling. Since water cannot overcome five fires, the eyes are blinded. Therefore, rushing against wind, one weeps but does not stop. Wind is born from fire, and Yang-qi is guarded within the spirit, so the fire-qi burns the eyes, causing one to weep when encountering wind. There is a comparison: just as fire produced by rapid wind can produce rain, this is its type.</p>"},{"location":"82_huangdi-neijing_jiu-zhen-shi-er-yuan_zh_translated/","title":"\u4e5d\u937c\u5341\u4e8c\u539f","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u65bc\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u5b50\u842c\u6c11\uff0c\u990a\u767e\u59d3\u800c\u6536\u5176\u79df\u7a05\uff1b\u4f59\u54c0\u5176\u4e0d\u7d66\u800c\u5c6c\u6709\u75be\u75c5\u3002\u4f59\u6b32\u52ff\u4f7f\u88ab\u6bd2\u85e5\uff0c\u7121\u7528\u782d\u77f3\uff0c\u6b32\u4ee5\u5fae\u937c\u901a\u5176\u7d93\u8108\uff0c\u8abf\u5176\u8840\u6c23\uff0c\u69ae\u5176\u9006\u9806\u51fa\u5165\u4e4b\u6703\u3002\u4ee4\u53ef\u50b3\u65bc\u5f8c\u4e16\uff0c\u5fc5\u660e\u70ba\u4e4b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee4\u7d42\u800c\u4e0d\u6ec5\uff0c\u4e45\u800c\u4e0d\u7d55\uff0c\u6613\u7528\u96e3\u5fd8\uff0c\u70ba\u4e4b\u7d93\u7d00\uff0c\u7570\u5176\u7ae0\uff0c\u5225\u5176\u8868\u88cf\uff0c\u70ba\u4e4b\u7d42\u59cb\u3002\u4ee4\u5404\u6709\u5f62\uff0c\u5148\u7acb\u937c\u7d93\u3002\u9858\u805e\u5176\u60c5\u3002 The Yellow Emperor asked Yi Bo, saying: My son has a hundred subjects and is responsible for nurturing the people while collecting their taxes.

The record begins with one and ends with nine. Please explain its meaning! The essence of Xiaotou is difficult to master once described but easy to grasp. Guarding the form, guarding the divine. Which divine? The guest is at the door. I have not yet seen how fast it is, but I know where it comes from. The slightest prick is swift and quick. Guarding the gate, guarding the mechanism, the movement of which never strays from its openness. The mechanism in the open is clear and quiet, subtle. It cannot be met when it arrives, nor pursued when it departs. Those who know the way of the mechanism can be sent out without fail. Those who do not know the way of the mechanism cannot be sent out. Knowing its coming and going requires setting a rendezvous. The darkness of Xiaotou is indeed remarkable, a technique unique to the craftsman. Going back was reversed, and coming forward was in order, knowing reversal and order, there is no doubt. Seize it and take it away, regrettably without deception? Pursue it and save it, regrettably without sincerity? Seize it along with it, follow it with your intent, and the way of the Xiaotou will be complete.</p> <p>3: \u51e1\u7528\u937c\u8005\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u5be6\u4e4b\uff0c\u6eff\u5247\u6cc4\u4e4b\uff0c\u5b9b\u9673\u5247\u9664\u4e4b\uff0c\u90aa\u52dd\u5247\u865b\u4e4b\u3002\u5927\u8981\u66f0\uff1a\u5f90\u800c\u75be\u5247\u5be6\uff0c\u75be\u800c\u5f90\u5247\u865b\u3002\u8a00\u5be6\u8207\u865b\uff0c\u82e5\u6709\u82e5\u7121\u3002\u5bdf\u5f8c\u8207\u5148\u3002\u82e5\u5b58\u82e5\u4ea1\u3002\u70ba\u865b\u8207\u5be6\uff0c\u82e5\u5f97\u82e5\u5931\u3002 The one who practices acupuncture, if there is emptiness, it will fill; if there is fullness, it will disperse; if it persists, it will be eliminated; if the disease wins, it will be emptied.

Evil Qi is at the top, turbid Qi is in the middle, and clear Qi is at the bottom. Therefore, when needling the pulse, the evil Qi will exit; when needling the middle of the pulse, the turbid Qi will exit; and if the needle goes too deep, the evil Qi will sink and the illness will worsen. Thus it is said: skin, flesh, sinews, and vessels all have their proper locations. Each disease has its own remedy. Each is different in appearance, and each should be treated according to its proper remedy, without reality or falsehood. A condition that is not enough but has an excess, this is called a severe illness. If the illness worsens, if one takes five pulses, they will die; if three pulses, it is dangerous; if one takes the Yin, they will die; if one takes the Yang, they will go mad, and the needling is finished.</p> <p>8: \u523a\u4e4b\u800c\u6c23\u4e0d\u81f3\uff0c\u7121\u554f\u5176\u6578\u3002\u523a\u4e4b\u800c\u6c23\u81f3\uff0c\u4e43\u53bb\u4e4b\uff0c\u52ff\u5fa9\u937c\u3002\u937c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u5b9c\uff0c\u5404\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\uff0c\u5404\u4efb\u5176\u6240\uff0c\u70ba\u523a\u4e4b\u8981\u3002\u6c23\u81f3\u800c\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6548\u4e4b\u4fe1\uff0c\u82e5\u98a8\u4e4b\u5439\u4e91\uff0c\u660e\u4e4e\u82e5\u898b\u84bc\u5929\uff0c\u523a\u4e4b\u9053\u7562\u77e3\u3002 Pierce without the qi arriving, and there is no need to count the number.

The one who skillfully uses the lancet will catch its hurry, just as removing the prick, cleaning the dirt, untangling the tangle, resolving the closure.

The Yang Ming belongs to the large intestine, and it connects to the lungs; hence, the two organs are paired. The three burners consist of the spleen, stomach, and pancreas; they are the palaces of transformation. The water passage emerges from the three burners and belongs to the bladder, making it the palace of the solitary. It is the site where all six palaces converge</p> <p>19: \u6625\u53d6\u7d61\u8108\u8af8\u6ece\u5927\u7d93\u5206\u8089\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u751a\u8005\u6df1\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u9593\u8005\u6dfa\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u590f\u53d6\u8af8\u4fde\u5b6b\u7d61\u808c\u8089\u76ae\u819a\u4e4b\u4e0a\u3002\u79cb\u53d6\u8af8\u5408\uff0c\u9918\u5982\u6625\u6cd5\u3002\u51ac\u53d6\u8af8\u4e95\u8af8\u4fde\u4e4b\u5206\uff0c\u6b32\u6df1\u800c\u7559\u4e4b\u3002\u6b64\u56db\u6642\u4e4b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u8655\uff0c\u75c5\u4e4b\u6240\u820d\uff0c\u85cf\u4e4b\u6240\u5b9c\u3002\u8f49\u7b4b\u8005\uff0c\u7acb\u800c\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee4\u9042\u5df2\u3002\u75ff\u53a5\u8005\uff0c\u5f35\u800c\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee4\u7acb\u5feb\u4e5f\u3002 According to the text, the translation for the given literary Chinese passage is as follows: </p> <p>In Spring, taking the Chong and Ren meridians, one should deeply take from the deep and shallow points. In Summer, take from the Guan sun channels, muscles, and skin. In Autumn, follow the Spring method. In Winter, take from the Jing and Guan of the Chong and Guan channels, leaving it deep if desired. This is the sequence for the four seasons, the placement of Qi, where illnesses reside, and how to store them. For adjusting the sinews, stand and take them, which can ensure success. For flaccid paralysis or stroke, spread and needle them, which can make one recover quickly.</p> <p>Remember, medical practitioners should always consult with their patients and refer to standard medical practices before applying any kind of treatment.</p>"},{"location":"84_huangdi-neijing_xiao-zhen-jie_zh_translated/","title":"\u5c0f\u937c\u89e3","text":"<p>1: \u6240\u8b02\u6613\u9673\u8005\uff0c\u6613\u8a00\u4e5f\u3002\u96e3\u5165\u8005\uff0c\u96e3\u8457\u4e8e\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002\u9ea4\u5b88\u5f62\u8005\uff0c\u5b88\u523a\u6cd5\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0a\u5b88\u795e\u8005\uff0c\u5b88\u4eba\u4e4b\u8840\u6c23\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u53ef\u88dc\u5beb\u4e5f\u3002\u795e\u5ba2\u8005\uff0c\u6b63\u90aa\u5171\u6703\u4e5f\u3002\u795e\u8005\uff0c\u6b63\u6c23\u4e5f\uff0c\u5ba2\u8005\u90aa\u6c23\u4e5f\u3002\u5728\u9580\u8005\uff0c\u90aa\u5faa\u6b63\u6c23\u4e4b\u6240\u51fa\u5165\u4e5f\u3002\u672a\u7779\u5176\u75be\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u77e5\u90aa\u6b63\u4f55\u7d93\u4e4b\u75be\u4e5f\u3002\u60e1\u77e5\u5176\u539f\u8005\uff0c\u5148\u77e5\u4f55\u7d93\u4e4b\u75c5\u6240\u53d6\u4e4b\u8655\u4e5f\u3002 Regarding the ease of explanation, it is easy because what is difficult to enter is also difficult to explain to people. For those who guard forms, they guard the needling technique. Those who guard spirits guard human life that cannot be supplemented with writing. Spirit guests are present at both right and wrong. The spirit is the right energy, and the guest is the evil energy. Those who stay by the door follow the right and wrong energy as it enters and exits. Not discerning its speed, the diviner does not know the speed of right and wrong energy.

Guarding the gate is like guarding the four limbs without knowing whether qi flows properly in and out. To guard machinery means to know how to guard qi. When machinery moves, but does not leave its empty space, one knows the difference between real and false qi, and uses needles with speed that is neither too fast nor too slow. The emptiness of machinery is clean and subtle; needles can reach the qi, sealing and guarding it so as not to lose it. When it arrives and cannot be met, qi is too abundant to supplement. When it departs and cannot be pursued, lost qi cannot be replenished. Do not hang it with hair, for qi can easily be lost. If the needle does not emit a sound, one does not know the intention of repairing or adding more. Blood and qi have been completely expended; the qi will not descend.</p> <p>3: \u77e5\u5176\u5f80\u4f86\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u6c23\u4e4b\u9006\u9806\u76db\u865b\u4e5f\u3002\u8981\u8207\u4e4b\u671f\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u6c23\u4e4b\u53ef\u53d6\u4e4b\u6642\u4e5f\u3002\u9ea4\u4e4b\u95c7\u8005\uff0c\u51a5\u51a5\u4e0d\u77e5\u6c23\u4e4b\u5fae\u5bc6\u4e5f\u3002\u5999\u54c9\uff01\u5de5\u7368\u6709\u4e4b\u8005\uff0c\u76e1\u77e5\u937c\u610f\u4e5f\u3002\u5f80\u8005\u70ba\u9006\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u6c23\u4e4b\u865b\u800c\u5c0f\uff0c\u5c0f\u8005\u9006\u4e5f\u3002\u4f86\u8005\u70ba\u9806\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u5f62\u6c23\u4e4b\u5e73\uff0c\u5e73\u8005\u9806\u4e5f\u3002\u660e\u77e5\u9006\u9806\u6b63\u884c\u7121\u9593\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u77e5\u6240\u53d6\u4e4b\u8655\u4e5f\u3002\u8fce\u800c\u596a\u4e4b\u8005\uff0c\u5beb\u4e5f\uff1b\u8ffd\u800c\u6fdf\u4e4b\u8005\uff0c\u88dc\u4e5f\u3002 One who knows the coming and going of energy knows the reversal, orderliness, prosperity, and vacuity thereof.

Only a craftsman fully understands the intention. Going with the reversal, one speaks of the energy as small and insignificant; coming with the orderliness, one speaks of the energy as balanced and harmonious. To know that there is no separation between reversal and orderliness, one can take advantage of it.

When full, release it; when full and swollen, constrain it with breath. For those who claim to expel Qi and blood, this means they have lost blood. When evil prevails in those who claim emptiness, those who are proficient in the classics speak of abundance. Those who are swift within and slow without claim reality, while those who are slow within and swift without claim emptiness. Speaking of reality and emptiness as if they exist or do not exist, reality has breath while emptiness lacks it. In examining past and present as if they are lost or existent, the reality or vacuity of the breath is in supplementing or releasing, and examines whether the breath has already settled and persists constantly. To create emptiness and reality, to gain or lose, speaking of those who supplement it implies that they have gained it, while speaking of those who expel it suggests they may have lost it.</p> <p>5: \u592b\u6c23\u4e4b\u5728\u8108\u4e5f\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u5728\u4e0a\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u90aa\u6c23\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e5f\u9ad8\uff0c\u6545\u90aa\u6c23\u5728\u4e0a\u4e5f\u3002\u6fc1\u6c23\u5728\u4e2d\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u6c34\u7a40\u7686\u5165\u4e8e\u80c3\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u6c23\u4e0a\u6ce8\u4e8e\u80ba\uff0c\u6fc1\u6e9c\u4e8e\u8178\u80c3\uff0c\u8a00\u5bd2\u6eab\u4e0d\u9069\uff0c\u98f2\u98df\u4e0d\u7bc0\uff0c\u800c\u75c5\u751f\u4e8e\u8178\u80c3\uff0c\u6545\u547d\u66f0\u6fc1\u6c23\u5728\u4e2d\u4e5f\u3002\u6e05\u6c23\u5728\u4e0b\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u6e05\u6fd5\u5730\u6c23\u4e4b\u4e2d\u4eba\u4e5f\uff0c\u5fc5\u5f9e\u8db3\u59cb\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u6e05\u6c23\u5728\u4e0b\u4e5f\u3002\u937c\u9677\u8108\uff0c\u5247\u90aa\u6c23\u51fa\u8005\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u937c\u4e2d\u8108\u5247\u6fc1\u6c23\u51fa\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u967d\u660e\u5408\u4e5f\u3002\u937c\u592a\u6df1\u5247\u90aa\u6c23\u53cd\u6c89\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u6dfa\u6d6e\u4e4b\u75c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u6b32\u6df1\u523a\u4e5f\u3002\u6df1\u5247\u90aa\u6c23\u5f9e\u4e4b\u5165\uff0c\u6545\u66f0\u53cd\u6c89\u4e5f\u3002\u76ae\u8089\u7b4b\u8108\u5404\u6709\u6240\u8655\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u7d93\u7d61\u5404\u6709\u6240\u4e3b\u4e5f\u3002\u53d6\u4e94\u8108\u8005\u6b7b\uff0c\u8a00\u75c5\u5728\u4e2d\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u937c\u76e1\u5927\u5beb\u5176\u8af8\u9670\u4e4b\u8108\u4e5f\u3002\u53d6\u4e09\u967d\u4e4b\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u552f\u8a00\u76e1\u5beb\u4e09\u967d\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u4ee4\u75c5\u4eba\u6047\u7136\u4e0d\u5fa9\u4e5f\u3002\u596a\u9670\u8005\u6b7b\uff0c\u8a00\u53d6\u5c3a\u4e4b\u4e94\u88cf\u4e94\u5f80\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u596a\u967d\u8005\u72c2\uff0c\u6b63\u8a00\u4e5f\u3002 The Qi is in the pulse, evil Qi is on top. Therefore, evil Qi is on top. When Dampness is in the center, it means that all grains enter the stomach, and the refined Qi rises to the lungs, while Dampness lingers in the intestines and stomach, indicating cold and heat not being suitable, improper eating and drinking, and illness arising in the intestines and stomach. Thus it is called Dampness in the center. When Clear Qi is at the bottom, it means that the Qi of clear dampness is in a healthy person, and it must start from the foot, so it is said that Clear Qi is at the bottom. In piercing the pulse, take out the evil Qi from above; when piercing the Conception Vessel, take out the Dampness Qi from the Yang Brightness meeting point. If you pierce too deep, then the evil Qi will sink, indicating shallow and floating diseases, and not wanting to pierce deeply. Too deep, and the evil Qi will enter in, so it is called sinking. Each has a specific location for the skin, muscle, and vessel pulses, meaning that each meridian has its own master. Taking the five pulses when dying means illness lies in the central Qi insufficiency, but use the lancet to write all the Yin pulses. Taking the three Yang pulse means completely writing the Yang Qi, making the patient unconscious. Robbing Yin means death, referring to taking the Sinew Vessel's five places of five goings. Robbing Yang means madness, indicating correct meaning.</p> <p>6: \u7779\u5176\u8272\uff0c\u5bdf\u5176\u76ee\uff0c\u77e5\u5176\u6563\u5fa9\uff0c\u4e00\u5176\u5f62\uff0c\u807d\u5176\u52d5\u975c\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u4e0a\u5de5\u77e5\u76f8\u4e94\u8272\u65bc\u76ee\u3002\u6709\u77e5\u8abf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u5927\u7de9\u6025\u6ed1\u6f80\u4ee5\u8a00\u6240\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u77e5\u5176\u90aa\u6b63\u8005\uff0c\u77e5\u8ad6\u865b\u90aa\u8207\u6b63\u90aa\u4e4b\u98a8\u4e5f\u3002\u53f3\u4e3b\u63a8\u4e4b\uff0c\u5de6\u6301\u800c\u5fa1\u4e4b\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u6301\u937c\u800c\u51fa\u5165\u4e5f\u3002\u6c23\u81f3\u800c\u53bb\u4e4b\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u88dc\u5beb\u6c23\u8abf\u800c\u53bb\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u8abf\u6c23\u5728\u4e8e\u7d42\u59cb\u4e00\u8005\uff0c\u6301\u5fc3\u4e5f\u3002\u7bc0\u4e4b\u4ea4\u4e09\u767e\u516d\u5341\u4e94\u6703\u8005\uff0c\u7d61\u8108\u4e4b\u6ef2\u704c\u8af8\u7bc0\u8005\u4e5f\u3002 Examining its color, observing its shape, knowing its rise and disappearance, discerning its motion and stillness - these are the skills of one who understands the five colors in the eye.

There is a fall or damage, resulting in stagnant blood inside; if there is excessive anger, qi accumulates in the diaphragm below, damaging the liver.

Zhong Chu replied, There are twelve meridians and 365 channels of blood and qi flowing to the surface through pores. The Yang Qi flows up to the eyes, making them see. The separate Qi flows to the ears, making them hear. The Zong Qi comes out of the nose, making it smell. The turbid Qi comes from the stomach, moving to the lips and tongue, making them taste.

Duke of Shao replied, If the pulse is rapid, the skin at the wrist is also tense; if the pulse is slow, the skin at the wrist is also relaxed; if the pulse is weak, the skin at the wrist is lessened and there is deficient Qi; if the pulse is full, the skin at the wrist is also distended; if the pulse is slippery, the skin at the wrist is also slippery; if the pulse is choppy, the skin at the wrist is also choppy. Any change in these should be subtle or obvious. Thus, a skilled practitioner of measuring the pulse does not rely on the inch, and a skilled practitioner of palpating the pulse does not rely on the color. He who can apply and blend and work skillfully can become a master craftsman, a master craftsman is ten parts complete out of nine. Those who can work in two (methods) are masters of middle rank, a master of middle rank is seven parts complete out of ten.

When it is severe, it causes hoarseness; when it is mildly severe, it results in qi stagnation referring to the back, with an increased tendency to cry. Mild severity leads to difficulty swallowing; when it is slightly mild, it indicates qi obstruction, referring to the throat and abdomen, causing lower abdominal pain. Infiltration leads to discomfort in the muscles and joints; when it is slightly infiltrated, it results in bleeding, tinnitus in the kidney and liver area, and dizziness.</p> <p>21: \u80ba\u8108\u6025\u751a\uff0c\u70ba\u7672\u75be\uff1b\u5fae\u6025\uff0c\u70ba\u80ba\u5bd2\u71b1\uff0c\u6020\u60f0\uff0c\u54b3\u553e\u8840\uff0c\u5f15\u8170\u80cc\u80f8\uff0c\u82e5\u9f3b\u606f\u8089\u4e0d\u901a\u3002\u7de9\u751a\uff0c\u70ba\u591a\u6c57\uff1b\u5fae\u7de9\uff0c\u70ba\u75ff\uff0c\u75ff\uff0c\u504f\u98a8\uff0c\u982d\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6c57\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u6b62\u3002\u5927\u751a\uff0c\u70ba\u811b\u816b\uff1b\u5fae\u5927\uff0c\u70ba\u80ba\u75fa\uff0c\u5f15\u80f8\u80cc\uff0c\u8d77\u60e1\u898b\u65e5\u5149\u3002\u5c0f\u751a\uff0c\u70ba\u6cc4\uff1b\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u70ba\u6d88\u75fa\u3002\u6ed1\u751a\uff0c\u70ba\u606f\u8cc1\u4e0a\u6c23\uff1b\u5fae\u6ed1\uff0c\u70ba\u4e0a\u4e0b\u51fa\u8840\u3002\u6f80\u751a\uff0c\u70ba\u5614\u8840\uff1b\u5fae\u6f80\uff0c\u70ba\u9f20\uff0c\u5728\u9838\u652f\u814b\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e0d\u52dd\u5176\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u61c9\u5584\u75e0\u77e3\u3002 The pulse is rapid and strong, indicating madness; slightly rapid and warm, indicative of lung heat and drowsiness, with coughing up blood, causing pain in the waist, back, and chest, suggesting a blocked nose.

Therefore, when acupuncturing urgency, one should penetrate deeply and leave it in for a long time; when treating slowness, one should shallowly penetrate and quickly eliminate the needle, to remove the heat; when treating large ones, lightly prick the qi without allowing blood to flow; when treating slippery ones, quickly eliminate the needle while shallowly penetrating, to regulate the yang qi and remove the heat; when treating turbid ones, one must locate the pulse, following its rise and fall, and leave it in for a long time. If the patient is small, both yin and yang qi are deficient; do not resort to acupuncture but use sweet herbs for regulation</p> <p>26: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u6ece\u3001\u4fde\u6240\u5165\u70ba\u5408\uff0c\u4ee4\u4f55\u9053\u5f9e\u5165\uff0c\u5165\u5b89\u9023\u904e\uff0c\u9858\u805e\u5176\u6545\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u967d\u8108\u4e4b\u5225\u5165\u4e8e\u5167\uff0c\u5c6c\u65bc\u5e9c\u8005\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I have heard of the qi of the Five Organs and Six Depositories.

The mystery of the nine needles lies in beginning and end; thus, knowing beginning and end, one's words are concluded, not knowing beginning and end, the path of needles is lost.</p> <p>2: \u592a\u967d\u6839\u4e8e\u81f3\u9670\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u547d\u9580\u3002\u547d\u9580\u8005\uff0c\u76ee\u4e5f\u3002\u967d\u660e\u6839\u4e8e\u53b2\u514c\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u9859\u5927\u3002\u9859\u5927\u8005\uff0c\u9257\u8033\u4e5f\u3002\u5c11\u967d\u6839\u4e8e\u7ac5\u9670\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u7a97\u7c60\u3002\u7a97\u7c60\u8005\uff0c\u8033\u4e2d\u4e5f\u3002\u592a\u967d\u70ba\u958b\uff0c\u967d\u660e\u70ba\u95a4\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u70ba\u6a1e\uff0c\u6545\u958b\u6298\uff0c\u5247\u8089\u7bc0\u7006\u800c\u66b4\u75c5\u8d77\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u66b4\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u8996\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7006\u8005\uff0c\u76ae\u8089\u5b9b\u81b2\u800c\u5f31\u4e5f\u3002\u95a4\u6298\uff0c\u5247\u6c23\u7121\u6240\u6b62\u606f\u800c\u75ff\u75be\u8d77\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u75ff\u75be\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u8996\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7121\u6240\u6b62\u606f\u8005\uff0c\u771f\u6c23\u7a3d\u7559\uff0c\u90aa\u6c23\u5c45\u4e4b\u4e5f\u3002\u6a1e\u6298\uff0c\u5373\u9aa8\u7e47\u800c\u4e0d\u5b89\u4e8e\u5730\u3002\u6545\u9aa8\u7e47\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u8996\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9aa8\u7e47\u8005\uff0c\u7bc0\u7de9\u800c\u4e0d\u6536\u4e5f\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u9aa8\u7e47\u8005\uff0c\u6416\u6545\u4e5f\u3002\u7576\u7aca\u5176\u672c\u4e5f\u3002 The Sun's root lies in the utmost Yin, and it unites at the command gate. The command gate is the eye. The Yang Brightness's root lies in severity, and it unites at the mouth corner. The mouth corner is the earlobe. If one lacks the Sun, then one will have deficiency diseases. One who has deficiency diseases takes from the Sun; if there is still not enough, it indicates a severe problem. Deficiency refers to the skin and flesh becoming weak. If the Yang Brightness is interrupted, then the Qi will be unable to rest and weakness and agility will arise. Those with weakness and agility take from the Yang Brightness; if there is still not enough, it indicates a severe problem. When Qi is unable to rest, evil Qi resides within. If the Lesser Yin is interrupted, then the body will be insecure and unstable. Those who are unsteady on their feet take from the Lesser Yin; if there is still not enough, it indicates a severe problem. The Lesser Yin refers to limbs that do not contract and collect. All talk of unsteadiness refers to the original disorder. It must be sought at its source.</p> <p>3: \u592a\u9670\u6839\u4e8e\u96b1\u767d\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u592a\u5009\u3002\u5c11\u9670\u6839\u4e8e\u6e67\u6cc9\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u5ec9\u6cc9\u3002\u53a5\u9670\u6839\u4e8e\u5927\u6566\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u7389\u82f1\uff0c\u7d61\u4e8e\u81bb\u4e2d\u3002\u592a\u9670\u70ba\u958b\uff0c\u53a5\u9670\u70ba\u95d4\uff0c\u5c11\u967d\u70ba\u6a1e\u3002\u6545\u958b\u6298\uff0c\u5247\u5009\u5ee9\u7121\u6240\u8f38\uff0c\u8188\u6d1e\u3002\u8188\u6d1e\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u8996\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6545\u958b\u6298\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u751f\u75c5\u4e5f\u3002\u95a4\u6298\uff0c\u5373\u6c23\u7d55\u800c\u559c\u60b2\u3002\u60b2\u8005\u53d6\u4e4b\u53a5\u9670\uff0c\u8996\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6a1e\u6298\uff0c\u5247\u8108\u6709\u6240\u7d50\u800c\u4e0d\u901a\u3002\u4e0d\u901a\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u4e4b\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u8996\u6709\u9918\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6709\u7d50\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002 The Yin is rooted in obscurity and whiteness, and connects with the Bao Palace. The Shao Yin is rooted in the bubbling spring and connects with the Lian Quan. The Ren Yin is rooted in Donghai and connects with the Yuying, and is attached to the Qihai. The Yin opens, the Ren closes, and the Shao Yang serves as the axis. Therefore, if the Yin is opened, then the Bao Palace and Mansion will have no outlet, causing the Qi to be blocked. Blocked Qi leads to illness. If it is folded, one experiences sadness and grief. Grief connects with the Ren Yin, and if there is not enough, it can lead to illness. When the axis is bent, then there will be knots in the meridians but they will not flow properly. Not flowing properly means that it connects with the Shao Yin, and if there are knots, then all of these can be traced back to a lack.</p> <p>4: \u8db3\u592a\u967d\u6839\u4e8e\u81f3\u9670\uff0c\u6e9c\u4e8e\u4eac\u9aa8\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6606\u4f96\uff0c\u5165\u4e8e\u5929\u67f1\u3001\u98db\u63da\u4e5f\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u6839\u4e8e\u7ac5\u9670\uff0c\u6e9c\u4e8e\u4e18\u589f\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u967d\u8f14\uff0c\u5165\u4e8e\u5929\u5bb9\u3001\u5149\u660e\u4e5f\u3002\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u6839\u4e8e\u53b2\u514c\uff0c\u6e9c\u4e8e\u6c96\u967d\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4e0b\u9675\uff0c\u5165\u4e8e\u4eba\u8fce\uff0c\u8c50\u9686\u4e5f\u3002\u624b\u592a\u967d\u6839\u4e8e\u5c11\u6fa4\uff0c\u6e9c\u4e8e\u967d\u8c37\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6d77\uff0c\u5165\u4e8e\u5929\u7a97\uff0c\u652f\u6b63\u4e5f\u3002\u624b\u5c11\u967d\u6839\u4e8e\u95dc\u6c96\uff0c\u6e9c\u4e8e\u967d\u6c60\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u652f\u6e9d\uff0c\u5165\u4e8e\u5929\u7256\u3001\u5916\u95dc\u4e5f\u3002\u624b\u967d\u660e\u6839\u4e8e\u5546\u967d\uff0c\u6e9c\u4e8e\u5408\u8c37\uff0c\u6ce8\u4e8e\u967d\u8c3f\uff0c\u5165\u4e8e\u6276\u7a81\u3001\u504f\u6b77\u4e5f\u3002\u6b64\u6240\u8b02\u5341\u4e8c\u7d93\u8005\uff0c\u76db\u7d61\u7686\u7576\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002 The text describes the channels of the twelve meridians in traditional Chinese medicine. </p> <ol> <li>Shenmen (Foot Taiyang) channel: Roots at Jinggu, flows through Guangmu, and connects to Tiankong and Feiyuan.

Each camp corresponds to the essence of the five organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys). The one without a count is called K\u016bnghs\u012bng. Regarding the fifty camps, when all five organs receive qi and hold their pulse points, they are counted as being at that level. When fifty movements occur without passing into the next generation, all five organs receive qi. When forty movements have passed into the next generation, one organ has no qi. When thirty movements have passed into the next generation, two organs have no qi. When twenty movements have passed into the next generation, three organs have no qi. When ten movements have passed into the next generation, four organs have no qi. When fewer than ten movements have passed into the next generation, all five organs have no qi. My understanding of this is limited to the beginning and end (terminus a quo and terminus ad quem). Regarding the fifty movements without passing into the next generation, it can be considered as a constant. Knowing the time of the five organs through my understanding of this short period, my estimation fluctuates between being too many or too few</p> <p>6: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9006\u9806\u4e94\u9ad4\u8005\uff0c\u8a00\u4eba\u9aa8\u7bc0\u4e4b\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u8089\u4e4b\u5805\u8106\uff0c\u76ae\u4e4b\u539a\u8584\uff0c\u8840\u4e4b\u6e05\u6fc1\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u6ed1\u6f80\uff0c\u8108\u4e4b\u9577\u77ed\uff0c\u8840\u4e4b\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u7d93\u7d61\u4e4b\u6578\uff0c\u4f59\u5df2\u77e5\u4e4b\u77e3\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u5e03\u8863\u5339\u592b\u4e4b\u58eb\u4e5f\u3002\u592b\u738b\u516c\u5927\u4eba\uff0c\u8840\u98df\u4e4b\u541b\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u67d4\u8106\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u8edf\u5f31\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u6153\u608d\u6ed1\u5229\uff0c\u5176\u523a\u4e4b\u5f90\u75be\u6dfa\u6df1\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u540c\u4e4b\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u818f\u6881\u83fd\u85ff\u4e4b\u5473\uff0c\u4f55\u53ef\u540c\u4e5f\uff1f\u6c23\u6ed1\u5373\u51fa\u75be\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u6f80\u5247\u51fa\u9072\uff0c\u6c23\u608d\u5247\u937c\u5c0f\u800c\u5165\u6dfa\uff0c\u6c23\u6f80\u5247\u937c\u5927\u800c\u5165\u6df1\uff0c\u6df1\u5247\u6b32\u7559\uff0c\u6dfa\u5247\u6b32\u75be\u3002\u4ee5\u6b64\u89c0\u4e4b\uff0c\u523a\u5e03\u8863\u8005\uff0c\u6df1\u4ee5\u7559\u4e4b\uff0c\u523a\u5927\u4eba\u8005\uff0c\u5fae\u4ee5\u5f90\u4e4b\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u56e0\u6c23\u6153\u608d\u6ed1\u5229\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: The five aspects of inverse and direct are about comparing the size of a person's words, bones, meat, skin, blood, and qi. I have already known these as they pertain to commoners. Now, the noblemen and rulers, who consume food and blood, have bodies that are both soft and tough, their muscles weak and pliable, their blood and qi subtle and slippery, how fast or slow their needling will be shallow or deep depends on it. The Duke of Shao replied: What is the taste of ointment, moxa, and cassia? If the qi is rapid, it will produce swift results; if the qi is sluggish, it will produce delayed results; if the qi is fierce, the needle will be small and shallow; if the qi is deep, the needle will be large and deep. If deep, one wants to retain it, if shallow, one wants to make it swift.

Qi Master said: When the body's Qi is insufficient and pathogenic Qi is abundant, it means that pathogenic Qi triumphs. Treat it urgently. When the body's Qi is abundant and pathogenic Qi is insufficient, treat it urgently by supplementing. If both the body's Qi and pathogenic Qi are deficient, this indicates that both Yin and Yang Qi are insufficient; it is not advisable to treat with acupuncture. If treated with acupuncture, it will lead to further insufficiency. When there is insufficiency, both Yin and Yang Qi will be depleted, blood and Qi will all be exhausted, the Five Organs will be empty, tendons and bones will turn brittle, causing the old to perish and the strong to wither away. When the body's Qi is abundant and pathogenic Qi is abundant, this means that both Yin and Yang have sufficient Qi. Expelling the pathogenic Qi and adjusting its reality. Therefore it is said: For what has sufficiency, treat it by expelling; for what is deficient, supplement it; this is what is meant.</p> <p>8: \u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u523a\u4e0d\u77e5\u9006\u9806\uff0c\u771f\u90aa\u76f8\u640f\u3002\u6eff\u800c\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u5247\u9670\u967d\u56db\u6ea2\uff0c\u8178\u80c3\u5145\u90ed\uff0c\u809d\u80ba\u5167\u441c\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u76f8\u932f\u3002\u865b\u800c\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u5247\u7d93\u8108\u7a7a\u865b\uff0c\u8840\u6c23\u7aed\u67af\uff0c\u8178\u80c3\u34a4\u8f9f\uff0c\u76ae\u819a\u8584\u8457\uff0c\u6bdb\u8160\u592d\u81b2\uff0c\u4e88\u4e4b\u6b7b\u671f\u3002 It is said that needling fails to distinguish between right and wrong, true and false.

Once sickness begins, there is reason for acupuncture. Be cautious in treating the illness, correspond with the time. Internally unify the Five Zang and Six Fu, externally unify the tendons, bones, and skin. Therefore, internally there are Yin and Yang, and externally there are also Yin and Yang. What is inside, the Five Zang represent Yin, and the Six Fu represent Yang; what is outside, tendons, bones, and skin represent Yin, and skin represents Yang. Therefore, it says: If sickness is in the Yin of Yin, acupuncture at the Ling-Ju, if sickness is in the Yang of Yang, acupuncture at the He, if sickness is in the Yang of Yin, acupuncture at the Jing, and if sickness is in the Yin of Yang, acupuncture at the Luo-Vessels. Therefore, it says that sickness in Yang is called Wind, sickness in Yin is called Stagnation, and Yin and Yang together are called Wind-Stagnation. Sickness has form but no pain is of the Yang type; formless but painful is of the Yin type. Formless but painful means the Yang is complete and the Yin is damaged. Urgently treat the Yin without attacking the Yang. Formed but no pain means the Yin is complete and the Yang is damaged. Urgently treat the Yang without attacking the Yin. Yin and Yang moving, sometimes having form and sometimes formless, cause anxiety and are called Yin overpowering Yang. This refers to not showing on the outside, and the form will not last long.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u554f\u65bc\u4f2f\u9ad8\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u5f62\u6c23\u4e4b\u75c5\u5148\u5f8c\uff0c\u5916\u5167\u4e4b\u61c9\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u4f2f\u9ad8\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u98a8\u5bd2\u50b7\u5f62\uff0c\u6182\u6050\u5fff\u6012\u50b7\u6c23\uff1b\u6c23\u50b7\u85cf\uff0c\u4e43\u75c5\u85cf\uff0c\u5bd2\u50b7\u5f62\uff0c\u4e43\u61c9\u5f62\uff1b\u98a8\u50b7\u7b4b\u8108\uff0c\u7b4b\u8108\u4e43\u61c9\u3002\u6b64\u5f62\u6c23\u5916\u5167\u4e4b\u76f8\u61c9\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao, I have heard about diseases related to form and qi, as well as external and internal correspondences.

If one's form is full and the pulse is firm and large, then it proceeds smoothly; if one's form is full but the pulse is small and weak, then vital energy declines, and decline means danger. If the form is full but the cheek does not rise, then the bones are small, and being small means perishing. If one's form is full and the flesh is thick and firm with divisions, then there will be longevity; if one's form is full but the flesh is without division and not firm, then it will perish. This is the way of heaven's life force, which establishes the foundation of form and determines vital energy based on longevity and perishing.

Bo Gao replied: Use 20 pounds of pure wine, Sichuan peppercorns 1 pound, dried ginger 1 pound, and cinnamon bark 1 pound. All four kinds are chewed and soaked in the wine. Use a cotton ball of one pound and four rolls of white cloth to put inside the wine bottle and seal it tightly so that it doesn't leak. After five days and nights, dry the cotton ball and cloth outside, then let the wine evaporate completely. When it's dry, use a container with cassia bark and cotton balls, make a wrap about six or seven feet long, which makes six to seven wraps, then use them to heat the places where you were pricked for cold colic. Warm it up thoroughly so that the heat reaches the disease area, and use hot cassia bark and cotton balls to moxa again, 30 times in total. When you wipe your body with a cloth, do it 30 times until you finish. After walking inside, you won't see any wind. Whenever you get pricked, you must moxa, like this the disease will go away. This is what they call internal heat</p>"},{"location":"88_huangdi-neijing_guan-zhen_zh_translated/","title":"\u5b98\u937c","text":"<p>1: \u51e1\u523a\u4e4b\u8981\uff0c\u5b98\u937c\u6700\u5999\u3002\u4e5d\u937c\u4e4b\u5b9c\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u70ba\uff0c\u9577\u3001\u77ed\u3001\u5927\u3001\u5c0f\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u65bd\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u5f97\u5176\u7528\uff0c\u75c5\u5f17\u80fd\u79fb\u3002\u75be\u6dfa\u937c\u6df1\uff0c\u5167\u50b7\u826f\u8089\uff0c\u76ae\u819a\u70ba\u7670\uff1b\u75c5\u6df1\u937c\u6dfa\uff0c\u75c5\u6c23\u4e0d\u5beb\uff0c\u652f\u70ba\u5927\u81bf\u3002\u75c5\u5c0f\u937c\u5927\uff0c\u6c23\u5beb\u592a\u751a\uff0c\u75be\u5fc5\u70ba\u5bb3\uff1b\u75c5\u5927\u937c\u5c0f\uff0c\u6c23\u4e0d\u6cc4\u5beb\uff0c\u4ea6\u5fa9\u70ba\u6557\u3002\u5931\u937c\u4e4b\u5b9c\u3002\u5927\u8005\u5beb\uff0c\u5c0f\u8005\u4e0d\u79fb\u3002\u5df2\u8a00\u5176\u904e\uff0c\u8acb\u8a00\u5176\u6240\u65bd\u3002 The art of acupuncture is most skillful with official implements. The suitable use of the nine needles varies, with different lengths and sizes for different applications. If you do not know how to apply them, illness cannot be alleviated. Shallow and rapid needling causes internal injury, leaving a wheal; deep and shallow needling leaves the qi unregulated, leading to a large wheal. Needling small areas with deep insertions causes harm; needling large areas with shallow insertions does not release the qi either, resulting in failure. In terms of the application of acupuncture, larger needles are inserted deeply and smaller ones are not moved.

First, shallowly pierce the skin to release Yang pathogenic factors; then pierce again to release Yin pathogenic factors. Superficially pierce and reach the muscles without going deep into the subcutaneous tissue. When you have entered the subcutaneous tissue, the grain qi will come out. Therefore, the method of acupuncture says: first shallowly pierce to chase away the pathogenic factors, followed by coming blood and qi, then deeply pierce to reach Yin pathogenic factors, and finally pierce extremely deep to release the grain qi.

The one who attends from beginning to end is recorded in the classics as a memorial. Holding the pulse and asking people to greet it, one can know whether there is excess or deficiency of yin and yang, whether it is balanced or unbalanced, and the Way of Heaven is finished. What is meant by a balanced person is that he does not fall ill; when there is no illness, one's pulse and greeting are in harmony with the four seasons, both going to and fro, and the six channels do not move. The pulse reflects the correspondence between yin and yang's extremes, the balance of cold and heat. The body's form, flesh, blood, and qi must correspond and be harmonious; this is what is meant by a balanced person. If there is insufficient qi, the pulse and greeting will also be insufficient, not measuring their dimensions. When this happens, both yin and yang are deficient, supplementing yang will deplete yin, and writing yin will cause yang to disappear. Such a situation should be treated with sweet wormwood; one cannot drink it as an emetic, lest one blister from the moxa stick.

If one supplements, then there is more substance; the substantial, their pulse is large and firm, but they are still far from recovery. Therefore, supplementation leads to reality and writing leads to vacuity, even though there is pain that does not follow the needle, the disease must decline. One must first establish the connection between the twelve channels and the illness before it can be transmitted to life and death. Thus, yin and yang should not be interchangeable, and vacuity and substance should not be tilted; one should take this to heart when treating disease.</p> <p>10: \u51e1\u523a\u4e4b\u5c6c\uff0c\u4e09\u523a\u81f3\u7a40\u6c23\uff0c\u90aa\u50fb\u5984\u5408\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u6613\u5c45\uff0c\u9006\u9806\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6c89\u6d6e\u7570\u8655\uff0c\u56db\u6642\u4e0d\u5f97\uff0c\u7a3d\u7559\u6deb\u6cc6\u9808\u937c\u800c\u53bb\u3002\u6545\u4e00\u523a\u5247\u967d\u90aa\u51fa\uff0c\u518d\u523a\u5247\u9670\u90aa\u51fa\uff0c\u4e09\u523a\u5247\u7a40\u6c23\u81f3\uff0c\u7a40\u6c23\u81f3\u800c\u6b62\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u7a40\u6c23\u81f3\u8005\uff0c\u5df2\u88dc\u800c\u5be6\uff0c\u5df2\u5beb\u800c\u865b\uff0c\u6545\u4ee5\u77e5\u7a40\u6c23\u81f3\u4e5f\u3002\u90aa\u6c23\u7368\u53bb\u8005\uff0c\u9670\u8207\u967d\u672a\u80fd\u8abf\u800c\u75c5\u77e5\u6108\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u66f0\uff1a\u88dc\u5247\u5be6\uff0c\u5beb\u5247\u865b\uff0c\u75db\u96d6\u4e0d\u96a8\u937c\uff0c\u75c5\u5fc5\u8870\u53bb\u77e3\u3002 Any practitioners of acupuncture, when the three needles are located at the grain spirit, if there is a mix-up between right and wrong, yin and yang being out of balance, opposite directions, then this should be corrected. Therefore, one needle leads to an excess of yang pathogen, two needles lead to an excess of yin pathogen, three needles lead to the arrival of grain spirit, and once the spirit arrives it stops there. The term arrival of the grain spirit refers to something being filled and real, something written down as being empty and void, therefore we can tell when the grain spirit has arrived. When the pathogenic qi leaves on its own, yin and yang have not yet been balanced and the disease is known to be getting better.

It also provides instructions for diagnosing and treating the condition based on whether it is excessive or deficient, hot or cold, and whether it has sunk down or not. The text concludes with details about how the pulse at a specific acupuncture point should appear under different circumstances.</p> <p>Translation: </p> <p>A disease of lung Qi stagnation presents with fullness and pain, causing bloating and wheezing, accompanied by coughing. There is pain in the lower abdomen, and in severe cases, the patient may clutch their chest and gasp for breath, manifesting as Qi stagnation. This condition affects those with lung disorders. The patient experiences coughing up Qi, shortness of breath, restlessness, fullness in the chest, pain in the inner aspect of the arm, and heat in the palm. If there is an excess of Qi, there will be pain in the shoulders and back, sweating due to wind-heat, and frequent urination with dribbling. If Qi is deficient, there will be pain in the shoulders and back, coldness, and insufficient Qi to dispel pathogens, leading to a changed appearance.</p> <p>To treat these various illnesses, first determine if they are excessive or deficient, hot or cold, and whether they have sunk down. If there is an excess, the pulse at a specific acupuncture point will be large, three times the size of a normal pulse. If there is a deficiency, the pulse will be smaller than normal. The treatment approach varies depending on whether it is excessive or deficient, hot or cold, and whether it has sunk down or not.</p> <p>6: \u5927\u8178\u624b\u967d\u660e\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u5927\u6307\u6b21\u6307\u4e4b\u7aef\uff0c\u5faa\u6307\u4e0a\u5ec9\uff0c\u51fa\u5408\u8c37\u5169\u9aa8\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u4e0a\u5165\u5169\u7b4b\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5faa\u81c2\u4e0a\u5ec9\uff0c\u5165\u8098\u5916\u5ec9\uff0c\u4e0a\u81d1\u5916\u524d\u5ec9\uff0c\u4e0a\u80a9\uff0c\u51fa\u9ac3\u9aa8\u4e4b\u524d\u5ec9\uff0c\u4e0a\u51fa\u65bc\u67f1\u9aa8\u4e4b\u6703\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0b\u5165\u7f3a\u76c6\uff0c\u7d61\u80ba\uff0c\u4e0b\u8188\uff0c\u5c6c\u5927\u8178\u3002\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5f9e\u7f3a\u76c6\u4e0a\u9838\uff0c\u8cab\u9830\uff0c\u5165\u4e0b\u9f52\u4e2d\uff0c\u9084\u51fa\u633e\u53e3\uff0c\u4ea4\u4eba\u4e2d\uff0c\u5de6\u4e4b\u53f3\uff0c\u53f3\u4e4b\u5de6\uff0c\u4e0a\u633e\u9f3b\u5b54\u3002 The Large Intestine Channel of the Yang Ming meridian begins at the root of the index finger, ascends along the back of the index finger, emerges between the two bones in the crease of the wrist, enters the muscle and rises to the surface, passing over the outer aspect of the elbow, up to the outer aspect of the shoulder, emerging from the front of the mastoid process, exiting at the junction of the axis bone, descending into the hollow of the inguinal ligament, connecting with the lungs, moving downward, it connects with the Conception Vessel and nourishes the large intestine.

When there is an excess, the patient will present symptoms three times greater than at the guan (governor) vessel point, and when there is a deficiency, the patient will present symptoms smaller than at the guan vessel point.</p> <p>10: \u813e\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u5927\u8dbe\u4e4b\u7aef\uff0c\u5faa\u8dbe\u5167\u5074\u767d\u8089\u969b\uff0c\u904e\u6838\u9aa8\u5f8c\uff0c\u4e0a\u5167\u8e1d\u524d\u5ec9\uff0c\u4e0a\u8e39\u5167\uff0c\u5faa\u811b\u9aa8\u5f8c\uff0c\u4ea4\u51fa\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4e0a\u819d\u80a1\u5167\u524d\u5ec9\uff0c\u5165\u8179\uff0c\u5c6c\u813e\uff0c\u7d61\u80c3\uff0c\u4e0a\u8188\uff0c\u633e\u54bd\uff0c\u9023\u541e\u672c\uff0c\u6563\u820c\u4e0b\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5fa9\u5f9e\u80c3\uff0c\u5225\u4e0a\u8188\u3001\u6ce8\u5fc3\u4e2d\u3002 The conception vessel, starting at the center of the foot where the spleen and kidney yin meet, follows the inner white side of the big toe, crossing the exocrine bone behind, ascends to the inner crook in front, goes along the back of the shankbone, connects with the beginning of the penile vessel outside the pubic arch, enters the abdomen, belongs to the spleen, nourishes the stomach, lifts the throat, links the origin of swallowing, disperses below the tongue; its connecting vessel, again comes from the stomach, separates upward to regulate the heart.</p> <p>11: \u662f\u52d5\u5247\u75c5\u820c\u672c\u5f37\uff0c\u98df\u5247\u5614\uff0c\u80c3\u8118\u75db\uff0c\u8179\u8139\uff0c\u5584\u566b\uff0c\u5f97\u5f8c\u8207\u6c23\uff0c\u5247\u5feb\u7136\u5982\u8870\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad4\u7686\u91cd\u3002\u662f\u4e3b\u813e\u6240\u751f\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u820c\u672c\u75db\uff0c\u9ad4\u4e0d\u80fd\u52d5\u6416\uff0c\u98df\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0c\u7169\u5fc3\uff0c\u5fc3\u4e0b\u6025\u75db\uff0c\u6e8f\u7615\u6cc4\uff0c\u6c34\u9589\uff0c\u9ec3\u75b8\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u81e5\uff0c\u5f37\u7acb\uff0c\u80a1\u819d\u5167\u816b\u53a5\uff0c\u8db3\u5927\u8dbe\u4e0d\u7528\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\u8af8\u75c5\uff0c\u76db\u5247\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u71b1\u5247\u75be\u4e4b\uff0c\u5bd2\u5247\u7559\u4e4b\uff0c\u9677\u4e0b\u5247\u7078\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u76db\u4e0d\u865b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7d93\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u76db\u8005\uff0c\u5bf8\u53e3\u5927\u4e09\u500d\u65bc\u4eba\u8fce\uff0c\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u5bf8\u53e3\u53cd\u5c0f\u65bc\u4eba\u8fce\u3002 This passage discusses the diagnosis and treatment of various illnesses in traditional Chinese medicine, based on the condition of the patient's tongue. </p> <p>Translation: When there is movement (of the body), it is due to illness of the sinew; when eating, there is vomiting, pain in the abdomen, distension in the belly, burping, and quick recovery after defecation, and the body feels heavy. This pertains to patients with illnesses caused by the spleen. The tongue is painful, the body cannot move freely, and food does not descend. The mind is restless, there is pain below the heart, there is discharge of pus, urinary retention, jaundice, hemorrhoids, and an inability to lie down. When standing, there is swelling and numbness in the groin and knees, and the toes cannot be lifted.</p> <p>For these illnesses, if they are predominant, write them down; if they are deficient, supplement them; if they are warm, disperse them; if they are cold, retain them; if they have sunken, use acupuncture; if they do not fit any of the above, use the classics.

When coughing up sputum, there is blood. Panting after drinking, sitting and wanting to get up, the eyes roll around like seeing nothing, and the heart feels suspended as if in a state of hunger. Insufficient Qi causes one to be easily frightened, with the mind being alert, like someone about to be caught, which is known as Jade Tear. This governs diseases generated by the Kidney, marked by a red tongue, a dry throat, swollen lymph nodes, a sensation of stuffiness in the chest, a dry and painful tongue, restlessness, heart pain, jaundice, abdominal bloating, lower back and inner thigh pain, impotence, liking to lie down, and hot and painful soles of the feet. For these diseases, if there is excess, regulate it; if deficient, supplement it; if there is heat, disperse it; if cold, retain it; if sunken in, apply acupuncture; if not excess or deficiency, use the Meridians.

This is a disease caused by qi imbalance. Symptoms include sweating, sharp pain in the eyes, facial pain, pain in the ears, shoulders, chest, elbows, forearms, and the sides of the small and index fingers. The treatment approach involves regulating the balance between excess and deficiency, using acupuncture for sinking conditions, and adapting techniques based on whether the condition is due to heat or cold. If the qi is in excess or deficient, the treatment will be adjusted according to the principles of the meridians. When there is an excess of qi, it manifests as a person standing upright with their hands outstretched at the Large Intestine (Lung) position, and when there is a deficiency, it manifests as their hands being pulled in close to the body, smaller than the Inception (Conception) position.</p> <p>24: \u81bd\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u76ee\u92b3\u7725\uff0c\u4e0a\u62b5\u982d\u89d2\u4e0b\u8033\u5f8c\uff0c\u5faa\u9838\u884c\u624b\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u81f3\u80a9\u4e0a\u537b\u4ea4\u51fa\u624b\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u5165\u7f3a\u76c6\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5f9e\u8033\u5f8c\u5165\u8033\u4e2d\uff0c\u51fa\u8d70\u8033\u524d\uff0c\u81f3\u76ee\u92b3\u7725\u5f8c\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5225\u92b3\u7725\uff0c\u4e0b\u5927\u8fce\uff0c\u5408\u65bc\u624b\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u62b5\u65bc\u4abc\u4e0b\uff0c\u52a0\u9830\u8eca\uff0c\u4e0b\u9838\uff0c\u5408\u7f3a\u76c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u8cab\u8188\uff0c\u7d61\u809d\uff0c\u5c6c\u81bd\uff0c\u5faa\u8105\u88cf\uff0c\u51fa\u6c23\u6c96\uff0c\u7e5e\u6bdb\u969b\uff0c\u6a6b\u5165\u9ac0\u53ad\u4e2d\uff1b\u5176\u76f4\u8005\uff0c\u5f9e\u7f3a\u76c6\u4e0b\u814b\uff0c\u5faa\u80f8\uff0c\u904e\u5b63\u8105\u4e0b\u5408\u9ac0\u53ad\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5faa\u9ac0\u967d\uff0c\u51fa\u819d\u5916\u5ec9\uff0c\u4e0b\u5916\u8f14\u9aa8\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u76f4\u4e0b\u62b5\u7d55\u9aa8\u4e4b\u7aef\uff0c\u4e0b\u51fa\u5916\u8e1d\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5faa\u8db3\u8dd7\u4e0a\uff0c\u5165\u5c0f\u8dbe\u6b21\u8dbe\u4e4b\u9593\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5225\u8dd7\u4e0a\uff0c\u5165\u5927\u6307\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u5faa\u5927\u6307\u6b67\u9aa8\u5167\uff0c\u51fa\u5176\u7aef\uff0c\u9084\u8cab\u722a\u7532\uff0c\u51fa\u4e09\u6bdb\u3002 The Dujue (Duyu) point is located on the Shao Yang meridian, starting at the bright and clear location of the eye, rising to the top of the ear lobe, following the front of the neck and extending to the hand of the Shao Yang.

Abundance refers to the person standing facing the great yin (or a position where the large intestine point is 1 cun larger than the governing vessel point), and deficiency refers to the person standing facing the small yang (or a position where the governing vessel point is smaller than the large intestine point).</p> <p>26: \u809d\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u8108\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u5927\u8dbe\u53e2\u6bdb\u4e4b\u969b\uff0c\u4e0a\u5faa\u8db3\u8dd7\u4e0a\u5ec9\uff0c\u53bb\u5167\u8e1d\u4e00\u5bf8\uff0c\u4e0a\u8e1d\u516b\u5bf8\uff0c\u4ea4\u51fa\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u4e0a\u8195\u5167\u5ec9\uff0c\u5faa\u80a1\u9670\uff0c\u5165\u6bdb\u4e2d\uff0c\u904e\u9670\u5668\uff0c\u62b5\u5c0f\u8179\uff0c\u633e\u80c3\uff0c\u5c6c\u809d\uff0c\u7d61\u81bd\uff0c\u4e0a\u8cab\u8188\uff0c\u5e03\u8105\u808b\uff0c\u5faa\u5589\u56a8\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u4e0a\u5165\u980f\u9859\uff0c\u9023\u76ee\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e0a\u51fa\u984d\uff0c\u8207\u7763\u8108\u6703\u65bc\u5dd4\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5f9e\u76ee\u7cfb\u4e0b\u9830\u88cf\uff0c\u74b0\u5507\u5167\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5fa9\u5f9e\u809d\uff0c\u5225\u8cab\u8188\uff0c\u4e0a\u6ce8\u80ba\u3002 The radialis minor pulse, which governs the kidney and influences the yin, arises at the intersection of the thick hair on the great toe. It rises along the inner side of the foot to the ankle joint, then ascends eight cun (approximately 12 cm or 4.7 inches) beyond it to reach the junction of the conception vessel and the governing vessel. Rising inside the inguinal ring, it follows the yin hollow of the thigh, enters the hairy region, passes in front of the genitals, strikes the small abdomen, embraces the stomach, belongs to the liver, unites with the gallbladder, ascends through the uterus, spreads over the costal margins, and follows the back of the throat. Then it enters the chin and joins with the governor vessel at the apex; its branches extend downward from the junction of the governing and conception vessels to encompass the eyes and ascend again to the lips. Another branch departs from the liver, separates from the conduit vessel, and ascends to the lung.</p> <p>27: \u662f\u52d5\u5247\u75c5\u8170\u75db\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdb\u4ef0\uff0c\u4e08\u592b\u3fc9\u759d\uff0c\u5a66\u4eba\u5c11\u8179\u816b\uff0c\u751a\u5247\u55cc\u4e7e\uff0c\u9762\u5875\uff0c\u812b\u8272\u3002\u662f\u809d\u6240\u751f\u75c5\u8005\uff0c\u80f8\u6eff\uff0c\u5614\u9006\uff0c\u98e7\u6cc4\uff0c\u72d0\u759d\uff0c\u907a\u6eba\uff0c\u9589\u7643\u3002\u70ba\u6b64\u8af8\u75c5\uff0c\u76db\u5247\u5beb\u4e4b\uff0c\u865b\u5247\u88dc\u4e4b\uff0c\u71b1\u5247\u75be\u4e4b\uff0c\u5bd2\u5247\u7559\u4e4b\uff0c\u9677\u4e0b\u5247\u7078\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u76db\u4e0d\u865b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7d93\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u76db\u8005\uff0c\u5bf8\u53e3\u5927\u4e00\u500d\u65bc\u4eba\u8fce\uff0c\u865b\u8005\uff0c\u5bf8\u53e3\u53cd\u5c0f\u65bc\u4eba\u8fce\u4e5f\u3002 If there is movement, it will result in pain in the waist; a man will have groin pain, and a woman may have abdominal distension, with symptoms such as dryness of the vagina, dusty face, and pallor. This is due to disease arising from the liver. Symptoms include fullness in the chest, nausea rising to the throat, vomiting, hiccups, pain in the hips and loins, dizziness, and deafness. For these diseases, if they are abundant, treat with bloodletting; if they are deficient, use tonics; if there is heat, use quick-acting medicines; if there is cold, use warm medicines; for those who have sunken pulse, use acupuncture; and do not apply bloodletting or tonics based on the pulse.

Yin refers to the kidney meridian, which nourishes and moistens the bone marrow; thus if it does not moisten, the flesh cannot be nourished either. When the flesh is not nourished, it becomes soft and weak. Soft and weak flesh results in long teeth and dirt accumulation, while hair loses its luster. Hair without luster indicates that the bones will die first.

Thus, if the channels are not honored, the sinews will become tight; when the sinews become tight, they will pull the tongue and the egg, leading to the lips turning purple, the tongue rolling up the egg, and the tongue contracting; the sinews will die first.

Determination to die means one is close to death for half a day.

All the floating channels that are often seen are the Luo channels. The six Luo channels, from Hand Yangming and Shaoyang's great Luo, originate in the space between the five fingers and join at the elbow. When drinking alcohol, Wei Qi goes first through the skin, fills the Luo channel first, and the Luo channel fills up first. Therefore, when Wei Qi is balanced, Ying Qi is full, and the meridians are abundant. The movement of the pulse at a crucial moment is always due to evil Qi residing there, staying at both the beginning and end, not moving, so it is hot but not firm, prone to sink and be empty, not mixing with others, which allows one to know which meridian's pulse is moving.</p> <p>35: \u96f7\u516c\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u77e5\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u8207\u7d61\u8108\u7570\u4e5f\uff1f\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u7d93\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u898b\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u865b\u5be6\u4e5f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c23\u53e3\u77e5\u4e4b\u3002\u8108\u4e4b\u898b\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u7d61\u8108\u4e5f\u3002 Master L\u00e1i asked: How do we know the difference between the regular pulse and the knotted pulse?

Emperor H\u00f3u said: All the channels cannot circulate freely through the large joints, so they must go along the small channels and come in and out through the skin; all of these are seen on the outside. Therefore, when piercing the channels, one must pierce where there is much bleeding and urgency to expel the evil and let blood out. Leaving it will lead to swelling. In general, when diagnosing the channels, if the pulse is greenish-blue, it indicates coldness and pain; if red, it indicates heat. Channels in the stomach area often have a greenish-blue hue when there is coldness inside; when there is heat within, the extremity of the channels will be red. If they are extremely black, leaving them for too long can lead to swelling. Red, black, and green indicate the presence of cold and hot energies. Short green indicates a deficiency of energy. In general, when piercing cold and heat, one must repeatedly take blood from them every day, until the blood has all stopped flowing and then it will regulate the emptiness and reality.

Inside they have five organs, which respond to the five tones, five colors, five times, five flavors, and five positions. Outside there are six departments, which respond to the six laws. The six laws build upon the classics of Yin and Yang and harmonize them with the twelve months, twelve stems, twelve degrees, twelve water channels, twelve times, and twelve channels of vital energy. These five organs and six departments are what respond to the Dao of Heaven. The twelve channels of vital energy are what make people live, give rise to disease, allow for treatment, cause disease to arise, form the basis of learning, and put an end to work. It is difficult to approach them, and yet easy to lose them. Please ask about their beginning and end, and how they enter and exit. Yi Bo kowtowed and said, How marvelous your question is!

When the palm faces downward, locate a depth of three cun below the axillary depression, entering the chest, not belonging to the three burners, it exits by circling the throat and exiting at the back of the ear, merging with the Shao Yang to complete the bone structure.

The sky is too high to be measured, and the earth is too vast to be calculated; this is what you are referring to. Moreover, humans live within the space between heaven and earth and inside the six covers (i.e., six sense organs). The height of heaven and the breadth of earth are not within human ability to measure. If an eight-foot man has his skin and flesh here, one can measure it and cut it around to obtain it; his death can be dissected and examined. His hiding place is rigid and brittle, the extent of his organs, the abundance of his grains, the length of his veins, the clarity or turbidity of his blood, the abundance of his Qi, the state of his twelve meridians with more or less blood and Qi, whether it is mostly abundant in blood and Qi or deficient in both, or solely deficient in blood, all have specific numbers. Treatment involves acupuncture and moxibustion, adjusting the meridian Qi according to each case, and fixing their constitutional balance.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f59\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u5feb\u65bc\u8033\u4e0d\u89e3\u65bc\u5fc3\uff0c\u9858\u5352\u805e\u4e4b\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u6b64\u4eba\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u53c3\u5929\u5730\u800c\u61c9\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e0d\u5bdf\u3002\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u5916\u5408\u6e05\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u8180\u80f1\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u6c34\u9053\u7109\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6e2d\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u81bd\u3002\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6d77\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u80c3\u3002\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6e56\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u813e\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6c5d\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u814e\u3002\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6fa0\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u809d\u3002\u624b\u592a\u967d\u5916\u5408\u6dee\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u5c0f\u8178\uff0c\u800c\u6c34\u9053\u51fa\u7109\u3002\u624b\u5c11\u967d\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6f2f\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u4e09\u7126\u3002\u624b\u967d\u660e\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6c5f\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u5927\u8178\u3002\u624b\u592a\u9670\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6cb3\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u80ba\u3002\u624b\u5c11\u9670\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6fdf\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u5fc3\u3002\u624b\u5fc3\u4e3b\u5916\u5408\u4e8e\u6f33\u6c34\uff0c\u5167\u5c6c\u4e8e\u5fc3\u5305\u3002\u51e1\u6b64\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u5341\u4e8c\u7d93\u6c34\u8005\uff0c\u5916\u6709\u6e90\u6cc9\uff0c\u800c\u5167\u6709\u6240\u7a1f\uff0c\u6b64\u7686\u5167\u5916\u76f8\u8cab\uff0c\u5982\u74b0\u7121\u7aef\uff0c\u4eba\u7d93\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u6545\u5929\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u5730\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u8170\u4ee5\u4e0a\u70ba\u5929\uff0c\u8170\u4ee5\u4e0b\u70ba\u5730\u3002\u6545\u6d77\u4ee5\u5317\u8005\u70ba\u9670\uff0c\u6e56\u4ee5\u5317\u8005\u70ba\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\uff1b\u6f33\u4ee5\u5357\u8005\u70ba\u967d\uff0c\u6cb3\u4ee5\u5317\u81f3\u6f33\u8005\u70ba\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u9670\uff1b\u6f2f\u4ee5\u5357\u81f3\u6c5f\u8005\uff0c\u70ba\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u6b64\u4e00\u9685\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\u4e5f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4eba\u8207\u5929\u5730\u76f8\u53c3\u4e5f\u3002 The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard of this, quick to the ear and difficult to understand in the heart. I wish to hear it once more. The Duke answered: This person is classified according to the Yin-Yang of heaven and earth, and cannot be overlooked. The foot Jueyin outside merges with clear water, inside belongs to the Bladder, and connects to the waterway. The foot Shaoyin outside merges with river water, inside belongs to the Gallbladder. The foot Yangming outside merges with sea water, inside belongs to the Stomach. The foot Taiyin outside merges with lake water, inside belongs to the Spleen. The foot Shayin outside merges with Swatow water, inside belongs to the Kidneys. The foot Jueyin outside merges with Gobi water, inside belongs to the Liver. The hand Jueyin outside merges with the Huai River water, inside belongs to the Small Intestine, and the waterway comes out of it. The hand Shaoyin outside merges with the Luo River water, inside belongs to the Triple Burner. The hand Yangming outside merges with river water, inside belongs to the Large Intestine. The hand Taiyin outside merges with the Yangtze River water, inside belongs to the Lungs. The hand Shayin outside merges with the Tongpu River water, inside belongs to the Heart. The hand Jingwell outside merges with the Chu River water, inside belongs to the Pericardium. All of these five viscera and six bowels have twelve waterways. Externally, there is a source of water, and internally, there is a place for it to be stored; all are interconnected between internal and external, like a circle without an end, just as human channels are the same. Therefore, heaven is yang, and earth is yin; above the waist is yang, and below the waist is yin. The Duke further said: The North Sea is yin, and the Lake is yin within the yin; the South River is yang, and from the North to the South is yin within the yang; the Luo River extends to the Yangtze River, which is yin within the yang of this corner. Therefore, people are related to heaven and earth by virtue of this yin and yang.</p> <p>4: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u7d93\u6c34\u4e4b\u61c9\u7d93\u8108\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u9060\u8fd1\u6dfa\u6df1\uff0c\u6c34\u8840\u4e4b\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u5404\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5408\u800c\u4ee5\u523a\u4e4b\u5948\u4f55\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u8db3\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u516d\u5e9c\u4e4b\u6d77\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u8108\u5927\uff0c\u8840\u591a\u6c23\u76db\uff0c\u71b1\u58ef\uff0c\u523a\u6b64\u8005\u4e0d\u6df1\u52ff\u6563\uff0c\u4e0d\u7559\u4e0d\u5beb\u4e5f\u3002\u8db3\u967d\u660e\u523a\u6df1\u516d\u5206\uff0c\u7559\u5341\u547c\u3002\u8db3\u592a\u967d\u6df1\u4e94\u5206\uff0c\u7559\u4e03\u547c\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u967d\u6df1\u56db\u5206\uff0c\u7559\u4e94\u547c\u3002\u8db3\u592a\u9670\u6df1\u4e09\u5206\uff0c\u7559\u56db\u547c\u3002\u8db3\u5c11\u9670\u6df1\u4e8c\u5206\uff0c\u7559\u4e09\u547c\u3002\u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u6df1\u4e00\u5206\uff0c\u7559\u4e8c\u547c\u3002\u624b\u4e4b\u9670\u967d\uff0c\u5176\u53d7\u6c23\u4e4b\u9053\u8fd1\uff0c\u5176\u6c23\u4e4b\u4f86\u75be\uff0c\u5176\u523a\u6df1\u8005\uff0c\u7686\u7121\u904e\u4e8c\u5206\uff0c\u5176\u7559\uff0c\u7686\u7121\u904e\u4e00\u547c\u3002\u5176\u5c11\u9577\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u80a5\u7626\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fc3\u64e6\u4e4b\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u6cd5\u5929\u4e4b\u5e38\uff0c\u7078\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u7078\u800c\u904e\u6b64\u8005\uff0c\u5f97\u60e1\u706b\u5247\u9aa8\u67af\u8108\u6f80\uff0c\u523a\u800c\u904e\u6b64\u8005\uff0c\u5247\u812b\u6c23\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: The meridians correspond to water channels, and the depth and distance of these meridians vary according to the amount of blood and qi. How should they be pierced when they are all different? Huang Di answered: The foot Yangming is where the six ministries and five zang meet, with large vessels and abundant blood and qi, it is warm and strong. If you pierce this area, do not go too deep and do not disperse or dissipate. When piercing the foot Yangming, go 6 cun deep and leave for ten breaths. When piercing the foot Taiyang, go 5 cun deep and leave for seven breaths. When piercing the foot Shaoyang, go 4 cun deep and leave for five breaths. When piercing the foot Taiyin, go 3 cun deep and leave for four breaths. When piercing the foot Shao yin, go 2 cun deep and leave for three breaths. When piercing the foot Jueyin, go 1 cun deep and leave for two breaths. For the hand Yangming and Shaoyang, as their channels receive qi more closely and their qi arrives more quickly, the depth of piercing should not exceed two cun, and the duration should not exceed one breath. The length, size, and fatness (of a person) are determined by intention; this is known as the constant way of law heaven, and acupuncture is similar in principle. If you go beyond this, it will result in evil fire consuming the bones and vessels, and if you pierce beyond this, the qi will escape.</p> <p>5: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592b\u7d93\u8108\u4e4b\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u8840\u4e4b\u591a\u5c11\uff0c\u819a\u4e4b\u539a\u8584\uff0c\u8089\u4e4b\u5805\u8106\u53ca\u8195\u4e4b\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u53ef\u70ba\u91cf\u5ea6\u4e4e\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u5176\u53ef\u70ba\u5ea6\u91cf\u8005\uff0c\u53d6\u5176\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e5f\u3002\u4e0d\u751a\u812b\u8089\uff0c\u800c\u8840\u6c23\u4e0d\u8870\u4e5f\u3002\u82e5\u592b\u5ea6\u4e4b\u4eba\uff0c\u6d88\u7626\u800c\u5f62\u8089\u812b\u8005\uff0c\u60e1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ea6\u91cf\u523a\u4e4e\u3002\u5be9\u3001\u5207\u3001\u5faa\u3001\u636b\u3001\u6309\uff0c\u8996\u5176\u5bd2\u6eab\u76db\u8870\u800c\u8abf\u4e4b\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u56e0\u9069\u800c\u70ba\u4e4b\u771f\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: Can the size of the meridians, the amount of blood, the thickness of the skin, the hardness or softness of the muscles, and the size of the veins be measured? Duke of Zhou replied: That which can be measured is doing so by degree. One should not strip away the flesh, as the vital energy will not decline. As for those who measure by degree, if they become thin and their body flesh strips away, they are bad candidates for acupuncture. Examination, puncture, examination, looping, palpation - these methods should be adjusted according to whether it is cold or warm, abundant or diminished. This is what it means to act appropriately in accordance with the principle of true medicine.</p>"},{"location":"94_huangdi-neijing_jing-jin_zh_translated/","title":"\u7d93\u7b4b","text":"<p>1: \u8db3\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u7b4b\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u8db3\u5c0f\u8dbe\uff0c\u4e0a\u7d50\u4e8e\u8e1d\uff0c\u90aa\u4e0a\u7d50\u4e8e\u819d\uff0c\u5176\u4e0b\u5faa\u8db3\u5916\u5074\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u8e35\uff0c\u4e0a\u5faa\u8ddf\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u8195\uff1b\u5176\u5225\u8005\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u8168\u5916\uff0c\u4e0a\u8195\u4e2d\u5167\u5ec9\uff0c\u8207\u8195\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0a\u7d50\u4e8e\u81c0\uff0c\u4e0a\u633e\u810a\u4e0a\u9805\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5225\u5165\u7d50\u4e8e\u820c\u672c\uff1b\u5176\u76f4\u8005\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u6795\u9aa8\uff0c\u4e0a\u982d\uff0c\u4e0b\u984f\uff0c\u7d50\u4e8e\u9f3b\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u70ba\u76ee\u4e0a\u7db2\uff0c\u4e0b\u7d50\u4e8e\u9804\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5f9e\u814b\u540e\u5916\u5ec9\u7d50\u4e8e\u80a9\u9ac3\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5165\u814b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0a\u51fa\u7f3a\u76c6\uff0c\u4e0a\u7d50\u65bc\u5b8c\u9aa8\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u51fa\u7f3a\u76c6\uff0c\u90aa\u4e0a\u51fa\u4e8e\u9804\u3002\u5176\u75c5\u5c0f\u8dbe\u652f\u8ddf\u816b\u75db\uff0c\u8195\u6523\uff0c\u810a\u53cd\u6298\uff0c\u9805\u7b4b\u6025\uff0c\u80a9\u4e0d\u8209\uff0c\u814b\u652f\u7f3a\u76c6\u4e2d\u7d10\u75db\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5de6\u53f3\u6416\u3002\u6cbb\u5728\u71d4\u937c\u52ab\u523a\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u70ba\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u75db\u70ba\u8f38\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u4ef2\u6625\u75fa\u4e5f1\u30021. \u4e5f : \u820a\u812b\u3002 The sinew of the foot's Yellow Emperor begins at the tip of the small toe, ascends to the heel, and its path upward follows the outer edge of the foot, ending at the ankle; it then loops around the heel, ending at the malleolus. Its other branch ascends alongside the lateral condyle of the tibia, connects with the tendon of the adductor muscle of the thigh, and joins its fellow tendons to connect with the buttock; its supplementary branch enters the resultant and ends at the medial condyle of the humerus. Its direct branch results in the tendon of the supraorbital muscle, connecting to the skull above, descending to the cheekbone and ending at the nose. Its supplementary branch supports the eyebrow above, descending and ending at the nape of the neck; its supplementary branch enters the axilla and ascends to connect with the coracoid process; its supplementary branch enters the inframammary area, ascends to connect with the crest of the ilium, and descends from there. Its supplementary branch exits the crest of the ilium, deviates upward to connect at the nape of the neck.

Patients with pain in these channels or along the course of the channels will have pain. Diseases arising from within cannot be pulled outward, and those arising internally cannot be elevated. Therefore, diseases of yang channels result in a reversed lumbar curvature that cannot be straightened, while diseases of yin channels result in an inability to be elevated. Treatment involves needle insertion at the appropriate points, using a counter-irritant and draining method, and internally administering heat-producing medicine. If this channel becomes twisted and knotted, the cord will emit signs of danger; if severe, it is fatal and is known as qu zhi yin.</p> <p>6: \u8db3\u53a5\u9670\u4e4b\u7b4b\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u5927\u6307\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0a\u7d50\u65bc\u5167\u8e1d\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4e0a\u5faa\u811b\uff0c\u4e0a\u7d50\u5167\u8f14\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0a\u5faa\u9670\u80a1\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u9670\u5668\uff0c\u7d61\u8af8\u7b4b\u3002\u5176\u75c5\u8db3\u5927\u6307\u652f\u5167\u8e1d\u4e4b\u524d\u75db\uff0c\u5167\u8f14\u75db\uff0c\u9670\u80a1\u75db\u8f49\u7b4b\uff0c\u9670\u5668\u4e0d\u7528\uff0c\u50b7\u65bc\u5167\u5247\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u50b7\u65bc\u5bd2\u5247\u9670\u7e2e\u5165\uff0c\u50b7\u65bc\u71b1\u5247\u7e31\u633a\u4e0d\u6536\uff0c\u6cbb\u5728\u884c\u6c34\u6e05\u9670\u6c23\uff1b\u5176\u75c5\u8f49\u7b4b\u8005\uff0c\u6cbb\u5728\u71d4\u937c\u52ab\u523a\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u70ba\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u75db\u70ba\u8f38\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u5b63\u79cb\u75fa\u4e5f\u3002 The ligament of the foot's yin (Flexor Hallucis Longus) begins at the top of the big toe, ascends to the front of the inner ankle, loops around the tibia, connects to the adductor muscles, loops around the pubic bone, and attaches to the genitals. When this ligament is injured, there will be pain at the big toe supporting the inner ankle, the adductor muscles, the pubic bone, and difficulty using the genitals. If injured internally, it will not rise; if injured by cold, the yin will retract; if injured by heat, it will stand erect and not retract. Treatment for this condition involves regulating water and clearing the yin energy; for those with pain that refers to other areas (referred pain), treatment involves needing and cupping at strategic points, identifying the pain as Seasonal Imbalance of Qi.</p> <p>7: \u624b\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u7b4b\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u5c0f\u6307\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u8155\uff0c\u4e0a\u5faa\u81c2\u5167\u5ec9\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u8098\u5167\u92b3\u9aa8\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u5f48\u4e4b\u61c9\u5c0f\u6307\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5165\u7d50\u65bc\u814b\u4e0b\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5f8c\u8d70\u814b\u5f8c\u5ec9\uff0c\u4e0a\u7e5e\u80a9\u80db\uff0c\u5faa\u9838\u51fa\u8d70\u592a\u967d\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u8033\u5f8c\u5b8c\u9aa8\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u5165\u8033\u4e2d\uff1b\u76f4\u8005\uff0c\u51fa\u8033\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0b\u7d50\u65bc\u9837\uff0c\u4e0a\u5c6c\u76ee\u5916\u7725\u3002\u5176\u75c5\u5c0f\u6307\u652f\u8098\u5167\u92b3\u9aa8\u5f8c\u5ec9\u75db\uff0c\u5faa\u81c2\u9670\uff0c\u5165\u814b\u4e0b\uff0c\u814b\u4e0b\u75db\uff0c\u814b\u5f8c\u5ec9\u75db\uff0c\u7e5e\u80a9\u80db\u5f15\u9838\u800c\u75db\uff0c\u61c9\u8033\u4e2d\u9cf4\u75db\u5f15\u9837\uff0c\u76ee\u7791\u826f\u4e45\u4e43\u5f97\u8996\uff0c\u9838\u7b4b\u6025\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u7b4b\u763b\u9838\u816b\uff0c\u5bd2\u71b1\u5728\u9838\u8005\u3002\u6cbb\u5728\u71d4\u937c\u52ab\u523a\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u70ba\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u75db\u70ba\u8f38\u3002\u5176\u70ba\u816b\u8005\uff0c\u5fa9\u800c\u92b3\u4e4b\u3002\u672c\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u4e0a\u66f2\u7259\uff0c\u5faa\u8033\u524d\u5c6c\u76ee\u5916\u7725\uff0c\u4e0a\u9837\u7d50\u65bc\u89d2\uff0c\u5176\u75db\u7576\u6240\u904e\u8005\u652f\u8f49\u7b4b\u3002\u6cbb\u5728\u71d4\u937c\u52ab\u523a\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u70ba\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u75db\u70ba\u8f38\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u4ef2\u590f\u75fa\u4e5f\u3002 The hand Yang meridian begins at the upper part of the little finger, passes through to the wrist, ascends along the inner aspect of the arm and terminates at the interior sharp bone behind the elbow, twists towards the little finger above and enters into the axillary fossa. Its branch goes downward following the rear aspect of the arm, ascends around the shoulder blade, loops around the clavicle and exits to the front of the yang meridian, terminating at the mastoid process behind the skull bone. Its branch goes into the ear canal. The directing vessel goes out from the top of the ear, descends and terminates at the lower lip, belonging to the outer aspect of the eyebrow. If there is disease affecting the little finger, wrist, interior sharp bone, inner aspect of the arm, axillary fossa, shoulder blade, clavicle, or skull bone, it causes pain. When it spreads downward and causes pain in the throat, it refers to the ear, causing ear pain and causing pain at the lower lip, leading to temporary loss of vision before recovery. If the throat muscle is tight, this can cause yang muscle swelling and neck inflammation, with cold or heat in the neck area. Treatment involves using acupuncture and moxibustion on the jueyin and shaoyang points along the meridian, following the pain for guidance. For swelling, needle in the opposite direction. This is known as the Xia Zhi syndrome.</p> <p>8: \u624b\u5c11\u967d\u4e4b\u7b4b\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u5c0f\u6307\u6b21\u6307\u4e4b\u7aef\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u8155\uff0c\u4e2d\u5faa\u81c2\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u8098\uff0c\u4e0a\u7e5e\u81d1\u5916\u5ec9\u3001\u4e0a\u80a9\u3001\u8d70\u9838\uff0c\u5408\u624b\u592a\u967d\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u7576\u66f2\u9830\u5165\u7e6b\u820c\u672c\uff1b\u5176\u652f\u8005\uff0c\u4e0a\u66f2\u7259\uff0c\u5faa\u8033\u524d\uff0c\u5c6c\u76ee\u5916\u7725\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e58\u9837\uff0c\u7d50\u65bc\u89d2\u3002\u5176\u75c5\u7576\u6240\u904e\u8005\uff0c\u5373\u652f\u8f49\u7b4b\uff0c\u820c\u5377\u3002\u6cbb\u5728\u71d4\u937c\u52ab\u523a\uff0c\u4ee5\u77e5\u70ba\u6578\uff0c\u4ee5\u75db\u70ba\u8f38\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5b63\u590f\u75fa\u4e5f\u3002 The hand's Yang channel begins at the root of the little and ring fingers, passes through the wrist, ascends along the arm, terminates at the elbow, goes around the outside of the elbow, across the shoulder, down the neck, and joins with the other hand's Yang channel.

When there is disease along its course, it turns and causes pain in the muscles. Treatment involves piercing with an awl or needle, using knowledge as the method and pain as the guide. If the disease leads to a collapse of the trapezius muscle and bleeding of blood and pus, it cannot be cured. The diseases of the channel of the yin muscle are characterized by pain when cold, causing the muscles to contract and spasm. When hot, the muscles become flaccid and do not retract. Deficiency of yin leads to a Yang urgency that causes contraction, and deficiency of yang leads to an inability to stretch. In the case of piercing with an awl or needle, it is for treating pain caused by cold, but if there is heat, the muscles do not retract and are untreatable with moxibustion.

Ascending registering the Ren (Kidney), from the Kidney registering the exterior of the Heart, dispersing in the chest; following the Heart mother vessel, exiting the armpit, descending the arm, exiting between the biceps, entering the palm center, exiting the end of the middle finger, returning to the small intestine and the end of the ring finger, merging with the Governor vessel. Ascending registering the Governing vessel, dispersing in the three Jiao, from the three Jiao registering the Liver, ascending and registering the Lung, looping the throat, entering the nostril hole, concluding at the lactation gate. Its diverging branches, on the forehead, looping the vertex, down the sacrum, descending and registering the end of the small intestine, following the Governing vessel enters the coccyx, this is the Governor vessel; enveloping the Yin organs, ascending through the hair, entering the uterus, ascending looping the abdominal cavity, entering the sacrum, down registering the Lung, returning to the Conception vessel. This is the practice of Qi's course, reversal and progression are constant.</p>"},{"location":"98_huangdi-neijing_mai-du_zh_translated/","title":"\u8108\u5ea6","text":"<p>1: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u8108\u5ea6\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u624b\u4e4b\u516d\u967d\uff0c\u5f9e\u624b\u81f3\u982d\uff0c\u9577\u4e94\u5c3a\uff0c\u4e94\u516d\u4e09\u4e08\u3002\u624b\u4e4b\u516d\u9670\uff0c\u5f9e\u624b\u81f3\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e09\u5c3a\u4e94\u5bf8\uff0c\u4e09\u516d\u4e00\u4e08\u516b\u5c3a\uff0c\u4e94\u516d\u4e09\u5c3a\uff0c\u5408\u4e8c\u4e08\u4e00\u5c3a\u3002\u8db3\u4e4b\u516d\u967d\uff0c\u5f9e\u8db3\u4e0a\u81f3\u982d\uff0c\u516b\u5c3a\uff0c\u516d\u516b\u56db\u4e08\u516b\u5c3a\u3002\u8db3\u4e4b\u516d\u9670\uff0c\u5f9e\u8db3\u81f3\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u516d\u5c3a\u4e94\u5bf8\uff0c\u516d\u516d\u4e09\u4e08\u516d\u5c3a\uff0c\u4e94\u516d\u4e09\u5c3a\u5408\u4e09\u4e08\u4e5d\u5c3a\u3002\u8e7b\u8108\u5f9e\u8db3\u81f3\u76ee\uff0c\u4e03\u5c3a\u4e94\u5bf8\uff0c\u4e8c\u4e03\u4e00\u4e08\u56db\u5c3a\uff0c\u4e8c\u4e94\u4e00\u5c3a\uff0c\u5408\u4e00\u4e08\u4e94\u5c3a\u3002\u7763\u8108\u3001\u4efb\u8108\uff0c\u5404\u56db\u5c3a\u4e94\u5bf8\uff0c\u4e8c\u56db\u516b\u5c3a\uff0c\u4e8c\u4e94\u4e00\u5c3a\uff0c\u5408\u4e5d\u5c3a\u3002\u51e1\u90fd\u5408\u4e00\u5341\u516d\u4e08\u4e8c\u5c3a\uff0c\u6b64\u6c23\u4e4b\u5927\u7d93\u96a7\u4e5f\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I want to hear about the pulse.

When there is a fullness of blood, it is dispelled by puncturing; when there is a deficiency, medicine is taken to strengthen. The five viscera are always within the cavity above the seven orifices. Therefore, lung energy circulates through the nose, so that when the lung is harmonious, the nose can sense odors and fragrances. Heart energy circulates through the tongue, so that when the heart is harmonious, the tongue can taste the five flavors. Liver energy circulates through the eyes, so that when the liver is harmonious, the eyes can distinguish the five colors. Spleen energy circulates through the mouth, so that when the spleen is harmonious, the mouth can discern the five grains. Kidney energy circulates through the ears, so that when the kidney is harmonious, the ears can hear the five tones. If the viscera are not in harmony, then the seven orifices will not be open. If the six bowels do not harmonize, then there will be a swelling. Thus, if pathogenic factors reside in the bowels, the Yang meridians will not be in harmony, and when the Yang meridians are not in harmony, energy will accumulate. Accumulation of energy leads to the fullness of Yang energy. When Yang energy is excessive, Yin energy is obstructed, and when Yin energy is obstructed, blood accumulates, leading to the fullness of Yin energy. Excessive Yin energy prevents the Yang from ascending, hence it is called relationship. Excessive Yang energy prevents the Yin from ascending, hence it is called constraint. When both Yin and Yang are excessive and cannot ascend, it is called relationship constraint. Relationship constraint means that death will not come at the proper time.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8e7b\u8108\u5b89\u8d77\u5b89\u6b62\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u69ae\u6c34\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u8e7b\u8108\u8005\uff0c\u5c11\u9670\u4e4b\u5225\uff0c\u8d77\u65bc\u7136\u9aa8\u4e4b\u5f8c\u3002\u4e0a\u5167\u8e1d\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f4\u4e0a\u5faa\u9670\u80a1\uff0c\u5165\u9670\uff0c\u4e0a\u5faa\u80f8\u88cf\uff0c\u5165\u7f3a\u76c6\uff0c\u4e0a\u51fa\u4eba\u8fce\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5165\u9804\uff0c\u5c6c\u76ee\u5167\u7725\uff0c\u5408\u65bc\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u967d\u8e7b\u800c\u4e0a\u884c\uff0c\u6c23\u5e76\u76f8\u9084\uff0c\u5247\u70ba\u6fe1\uff0c\u76ee\u6c23\u4e0d\u69ae\uff0c\u5247\u76ee\u4e0d\u5408\u3002 Emperor Yellow said: If the Bubble Vessel is established and secured, where does the energy and prestige of water come from?

How do yin and yang meet? What is the qi for defense? What is the qi for nourishment? Is the nourished securely established? Does defense meet with it? The elderly have different qi; yin and yang are not in harmony. I wish to hear about their meeting. Confucius replied: People receive qi from grains, which enter the stomach and pass them on to the lungs. Five zang and six fu are all nourished by receiving qi. The clear qi is for defense, and the turbid qi is for nourishment. Defense remains unrested in the vessels, and after fifty years it returns to a great meeting. Yin and yang intertwine, like a never-ending cycle. The defense qi circulates through the yin 25 times and the yang 25 times, divided into day and night. When the qi reaches yang, it rises; when it reaches yin, it stops. Thus, in the daytime, there is a peak yang, called the 'reinforcing yang,' and at midnight, there is a peak yin, called the 'reinforcing yin.' Therefore, the Taiyin governs inside and the Taiyang governs outside, each having 25 cycles divided into day and night. At midnight, it becomes a peak yin, followed by yin deficiency. At dawn, the yin is exhausted, and the qi begins to receive yang. In the daytime, there is a peak yang as the sun sets, and when it enters the yang, the qi receives yin. At midnight, there is a great meeting, and all people rest; the command is called 'merging yin.' At dawn, the yin is exhausted, and the qi begins to receive yang, just like the harmony between heaven and earth without end.</p> <p>2: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u8001\u4eba\u4e4b\u4e0d\u591c\u7791\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\uff1f\u5c11\u58ef\u4e4b\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u665d\u7791\u8005\uff0c\u4f55\u6c23\u4f7f\u7136\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u58ef\u8005\u4e4b\u6c23\u8840\u76db\uff0c\u5176\u808c\u8089\u6ed1\uff0c\u6c23\u9053\u901a\uff0c\u71df\u885b\u4e4b\u884c\u4e0d\u5931\u5176\u5e38\uff0c\u6545\u665d\u7cbe\u800c\u591c\u7791\u3002\u8001\u8005\u4e4b\u6c23\u8840\u8870\uff0c\u5176\u808c\u8089\u67af\uff0c\u6c23\u9053\u6f80\uff0c\u4e94\u85cf\u4e4b\u6c23\u76f8\u640f\uff0c\u5176\u71df\u6c23\u8870\u5c11\u800c\u885b\u6c23\u5167\u4f10\uff0c\u6545\u665d\u4e0d\u7cbe\uff0c\u591c\u4e0d\u7791\u3002 Yellow Emperor asked: Why do the elderly not sleep at night, and what Qi makes this possible?

The elderly have weakened Qi and blood, their muscles are withered, their meridians are blocked, the Qi in the five organs fight against each other, and their regulation of internal organs becomes weak while their defensive Qi attacks internally, so they do not rest during the day and sleep at night.</p> <p>3: \u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u71df\u885b\u4e4b\u6240\u884c\uff0c\u7686\u4f55\u9053\u5f9e\u4f86\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u71df\u51fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7126\uff0c\u885b\u51fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u7126\u3002\u9ec3\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u9858\u805e\u4e09\u7126\u4e4b\u6240\u51fa\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u7b54\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0a\u7126\u51fa\u65bc\u80c3\u4e0a\u53e3\uff0c\u4e26\u54bd\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8cab\u8188\uff0c\u800c\u5e03\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d70\u814b\uff0c\u5faa\u592a\u9670\u4e4b\u5206\u800c\u884c\uff0c\u9084\u81f3\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u4e0a\u81f3\u820c\uff0c\u4e0b\u8db3\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u5e38\u8207\u71df\u4ff1\u884c\u4e8e\u967d\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u5ea6\uff0c\u884c\u4e8e\u9670\u4ea6\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u5ea6\u4e00\u5468\u4e5f\u3002\u6545\u4e94\u5341\u5ea6\u800c\u5fa9\u592a\u6703\u4e8e\u624b\u592a\u9670\u77e3\u3002 Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the functions of the warmer and weaker, and where they come from.

Master Qi replied: The upper focus comes out from above the stomach and the throat above, passing through the conception vessel, spreading over the chest, going across the armpit, following the kidney channel, and running its course until it returns to Yang Ming. It ascends to the tongue, goes down to the sole, always accompanying Yang Ming in its course of 25 degrees, and also in its Yin course of 25 degrees in a week.

Food and drink enter the stomach, but its energy has not yet stabilized, and then sweat will come out, sometimes from the face, sometimes from the back, or from half of the body. This does not follow the path of defensive Qi, why? Duke of Shao said: This is an external injury caused by wind, opening the brain and marrow, causing the sweat glands to release, and making the defensive Qi move uncontrollably. Therefore, it cannot follow its path. This Qi is unruly, quick, and slippery, and appears when opened, so it cannot follow its path.

Therefore, one cannot create works without knowing how much a year has been added, the waxing and waning of qi, and what causes the rise or fall of emptiness and reality.</p> <p>5: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u904b\u4e4b\u59cb\uff0c\u5982\u74b0\u7121\u7aef\uff0c\u5176\u592a\u904e\u4e0d\u53ca\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u4e94\u6c23\u66f4\u7acb\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u52dd\uff0c\u76db\u865b\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u6b64\u5176\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5e73\u6c23\u4f55\u5982\uff1f\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u7121\u904e\u8005\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u592a\u904e\u4e0d\u53ca\u5948\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5728\u7d93\u6709\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u8b02\u6240\u52dd\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6625\u52dd\u9577\u590f\uff0c\u9577\u590f\u52dd\u51ac\uff0c\u51ac\u52dd\u590f\uff0c\u590f\u52dd\u79cb\uff0c\u79cb\u52dd\u6625\uff0c\u6240\u8b02\u5f97\u4e94\u884c\u6642\u4e4b\u52dd\uff0c\u5404\u4ee5\u6c23\u547d\u5176\u85cf\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u4f55\u4ee5\u77e5\u5176\u52dd\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6c42\u5176\u81f3\u4e5f\uff0c\u7686\u6b78\u59cb\u6625\uff0c\u672a\u81f3\u800c\u81f3\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u592a\u904e\uff0c\u5247\u8584\u6240\u4e0d\u52dd\uff0c\u800c\u4e58\u6240\u52dd\u4e5f\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u6c23\u6deb\u3002\u4e0d\u5206\u90aa\u50fb\u5167\u751f\uff0c\u5de5\u4e0d\u80fd\u7981\u3002\u81f3\u800c\u4e0d\u81f3\uff0c\u6b64\u8b02\u4e0d\u53ca\uff0c\u5247\u6240\u52dd\u5984\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u6240\u751f\u53d7\u75c5\uff0c\u6240\u4e0d\u52dd\u8584\u4e4b\u4e5f\uff0c\u547d\u66f0\u6c23\u8feb\u3002\u6240\u8b02\u6c42\u5176\u81f3\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u81f3\u4e4b\u6642\u4e5f\u3002\u8b39\u5019\u5176\u6642\uff0c\u6c23\u53ef\u8207\u671f\uff0c\u5931\u6642\u53cd\u5019\uff0c\u4e94\u6cbb\u4e0d\u5206\uff0c\u90aa\u50fb\u5167\u751f\uff0c\u5de5\u4e0d\u80fd\u7981\u4e5f\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u6709\u4e0d\u8972\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u84bc\u5929\u4e4b\u6c23\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u7121\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u6c23\u4e4b\u4e0d\u8972\uff0c\u662f\u8b02\u975e\u5e38\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u5247\u8b8a\u77e3\u3002\u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u975e\u5e38\u800c\u8b8a\u67f0\u4f55\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u8b8a\u81f3\u5247\u75c5\u6240\uff0c\u52dd\u5247\u5fae\uff0c\u6240\u4e0d\u52dd\u5247\u751a\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u91cd\u611f\u65bc\u90aa\uff0c\u5247\u6b7b\u77e3\u3002\u6545\u975e\u5176\u6642\u5247\u5fae\uff0c\u7576\u5176\u6642\u5247\u751a\u4e5f\u3002 Emperor: The beginning of the five phases is like a circle without an endpoint, and exceeding this is not good. Duke of Shao said: The five energies are established in their own strength, each having its own victory, the change between excess and deficiency is what is constant. Emperor asked: What is the balance like? Duke of Shao said: It has no excess. Emperor asked: What about too much? Duke of Shao said: There is a saying in the classics. Emperor asked: What do you mean by victory? Duke of Shao said: Spring triumphs over summer, summer triumphs over autumn, autumn triumphs over summer, summer triumphs over winter, and winter triumphs over spring; this refers to obtaining the five phases' time of victory, each controlling the spirit of its corresponding energy. Emperor asked: How do you know it is victorious? Duke of Shao said: Seek perfection, all will return to the beginning of spring, not yet reached but already arrived, which refers to exceeding the limit and triumphing in that which is weak, called chaotic energy. Not dividing good and evil, internal generation, skill cannot restrain. Already arrived but not yet arrived, which means not victorious, resulting in false actions and the illness suffered by what is weak, called pressing energy. That which seeks perfection refers to the time when energy is complete. Be careful of the time, energy can be anticipated; miss the time and reverse, the five treatments will not be divided, evil internal generation, skill cannot restrain. Emperor: Is there no end to it? Duke of Shao said: The energy of the sky and earth has no constancy. Energy without end is what is not constant, and thus changes. Emperor asked: What does changing mean? Duke of Shao said: Changing leads to illness, victory leads to mildness, what is not victorious leads to seriousness, causing people to pay more attention to evil, leading to death. Therefore, if it is not the time, it is mild, and if it is the time, it becomes serious.</p> <p>6: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u5584\u3002\u4f59\u805e\u6c23\u5408\u800c\u6709\u5f62\uff0c\u56e0\u8b8a\u4ee5\u6b63\u540d\u3002\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u904b\uff0c\u9670\u967d\u4e4b\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u65bc\u842c\u7269\uff0c\u5b70\u5c11\u5b70\u591a\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u805e\u4e4e\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u6089\u54c9\u554f\u4e5f\uff0c\u5929\u81f3\u5ee3\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ea6\uff0c\u5730\u81f3\u5927\u4e0d\u53ef\u91cf\uff0c\u5927\u795e\u9748\u554f\uff0c\u8acb\u9673\u5176\u65b9\u3002\u8349\u751f\u4e94\u8272\uff0c\u4e94\u8272\u4e4b\u8b8a\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u8996\uff1b\u8349\u751f\u4e94\u5473\uff0c\u4e94\u5473\u4e4b\u7f8e\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u52dd\u6975\uff0c\u55dc\u6b32\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u6240\u901a\u3002\u5929\u98df\u4eba\u4ee5\u4e94\u6c23\uff0c\u5730\u98df\u4eba\u4ee5\u4e94\u5473\u3002\u4e94\u6c23\u5165\u9f3b\uff0c\u85cf\u65bc\u5fc3\u80ba\uff0c\u4e0a\u4f7f\u4e94\u8272\u8129\u660e\uff0c\u97f3\u8072\u80fd\u5f70\u3002\u4e94\u5473\u5165\u53e3\uff0c\u85cf\u65bc\u8178\u80c3\uff0c\u5473\u6709\u6240\u85cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u990a\u4e94\u6c23\uff0c\u6c23\u548c\u800c\u751f\u6d25\u6db2\u76f8\u6210\uff0c\u795e\u4e43\u81ea\u751f\u3002 The emperor said: Good. I have heard that qi gathers and forms a shape, transforms and gives rise to the name through changes. The movement of heaven and earth, the transformation of yin and yang, how much is there in myriad things, can it be fully understood? Duke Huan asked: This is indeed a profound question. Heaven is vast and cannot be measured, and earth is immense and cannot be quantified. Great spirits ask about this, please explain the method. Grass produces five colors, the changes of these colors are beyond sight; grass produces five flavors, the sweetness of these flavors is beyond measure, desires differ, each has its own path. Heaven feeds people with five qi, and earth nourishes people with five flavors. The five qi enter the nose, are stored in the heart and lungs, and make the five colors clearer, the sounds audible. The five flavors enter the mouth, are stored in the stomach and intestines, the flavor has its own storage, nourishing the five qi, when the qi is harmonious, body fluids are produced, and spirit arises.</p> <p>7: \u5e1d\u66f0\uff1a\u85cf\u8c61\u4f55\u5982\u3002\u6b67\u4f2f\u66f0\uff1a\u5fc3\u8005\uff0c\u751f\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u795e\u4e4b\u8b8a\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u83ef\u5728\u9762\uff0c\u5176\u5145\u5728\u8840\u8108\uff0c\u70ba\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u901a\u65bc\u590f\u6c23\u3002\u80ba\u8005\uff0c\u6c23\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u9b44\u4e4b\u8655\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u83ef\u5728\u6bdb\uff0c\u5176\u5145\u5728\u76ae\uff0c\u70ba\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u901a\u65bc\u79cb\u6c23\u3002\u814e\u8005\uff0c\u4e3b\u87c4\u5c01\u85cf\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u7cbe\u4e4b\u8655\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u83ef\u5728\u9aee\uff0c\u5176\u5145\u5728\u9aa8\uff0c\u70ba\u9670\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u901a\u65bc\u51ac\u6c23\u3002\u809d\u8005\uff0c\u7f77\u6975\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u9b42\u4e4b\u5c45\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u83ef\u5728\u722a\uff0c\u5176\u5145\u5728\u7b4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u8840\u6c23\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u9178\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u84bc\uff0c\u6b64\u70ba\u967d\u4e2d\u4e4b\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u901a\u65bc\u6625\u6c23\u3002\u813e\u80c3\u5927\u8178\u5c0f\u8178\u4e09\u7126\u8180\u80f1\u8005\uff0c\u5009\u5ee9\u4e4b\u672c\uff0c\u71df\u4e4b\u5c45\u4e5f\uff0c\u540d\u66f0\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u5316\u7cdf\u7c95\uff0c\u8f49\u5473\u800c\u5165\u51fa\u8005\u4e5f\uff0c\u5176\u83ef\u5728\u8123\u56db\u767d\uff0c\u5176\u5145\u5728\u808c\uff0c\u5176\u5473\u7518\uff0c\u5176\u8272\u9ec3\uff0c\u6b64\u81f3\u9670\u4e4b\u985e\u901a\u65bc\u571f\u6c23\u3002\u51e1\u5341\u4e00\u85cf\u53d6\u6c7a\u65bc\u81bd\u4e5f\u3002 The Emperor asked: How is the storage of the dragon? The Grand Preceptor replied: The heart, being the source of life and spirit, has its brilliance in its face and its fullness in the blood vessels; it is the yang within the yang and reaches the qi of summer. The lungs, being the root of breath and soul, have their brilliance in the hair and their fullness in the skin; they are the yang within the yin and reach the qi of autumn. The kidneys, ruling over the concealed storage, are the place of essence; they have their brilliance in the nails and their fullness in the bones, being the yin within the yin and reaching the qi of winter. The liver is the source of extremes and the dwelling of the soul; it has its brilliance in the claws and its fullness in the tendons, generating blood and qi, with a sour taste and a bluish hue, being the yang within the yin and reaching the qi of spring. The spleen, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, three junctions, bladder are the depots of granaries, dwelling places of transformation; they are called organs, able to transform dregs and change flavors as they enter and exit, with their brilliance in the lips and whiteness, their fullness in the muscles, having a sweet taste and yellow hue, being the essence of yin and reaching the qi of earth. The storage of all eleven organs depends on the gallbladder.</p> <p>8: \u6545\u4eba\u8fce\u4e00\u76db\u75c5\u5728\u5c11\u967d\uff0c\u4e8c\u76db\u75c5\u5728\u592a\u967d\uff0c\u4e09\u76db\u75c5\u5728\u967d\u660e\uff0c\u56db\u76db\u5df2\u4e0a\u70ba\u683c\u967d\u3002\u5bf8\u53e3\u4e00\u76db\uff0c\u75c5\u5728\u53a5\u9670\uff0c\u4e8c\u76db\u75c5\u5728\u5c11\u9670\uff0c\u4e09\u76db\u75c5\u5728\u592a\u9670\uff0c\u56db\u76db\u5df2\u4e0a\u70ba\u95dc\u9670\u3002\u4eba\u8fce\u8207\u5bf8\u53e3\u4ff1\u76db\u56db\u500d\u5df2\u4e0a\u70ba\u95dc\u683c\uff0c\u95dc\u683c\u4e4b\u8108\u8d0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6975\u65bc\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u7cbe\u6c23\uff0c\u5247\u6b7b\u77e3\u3002 Originally, there was a person who had three bouts of illness: one at Shao Yang, another at Tai Yang, and the third at Yang Ming. After the fourth bout, it became a Gan Yang. He then experienced four bouts of illness at Jue Yin, two at Shaoyin, and three at Taijing, after which it became Guan Yin. When both Gan Yang and Jue Yin reached fourfold increase, they became Guan Gui (Relation between the channels). If the pulse in this relation is not strong enough to prevail over the vital qi of heaven and earth, then one will surely die.</p>"}]}
