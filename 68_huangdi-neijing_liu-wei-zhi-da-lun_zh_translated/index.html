<h1 id="_1">六微旨大論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：嗚呼遠哉，天之道也，如迎浮雲，若視深淵，視深淵尚可測，迎浮雲莫知其極。夫子數言謹奉天道，余聞而藏之，心私異之，不知其所謂也。願夫子溢志盡言其事，令終不滅，久而不絕，天之道可得聞乎。歧伯稽首再拜對曰：明乎哉問天之道也，此因天之序盛衰之時也。
Yellow Emperor asked: Ah, how distant the way of Heaven is! It is like welcoming passing clouds and looking into the abyss. Looking into the abyss can still be measured, but welcoming passing clouds, who knows its limits? The Master spoke several times about carefully following the way of Heaven. I heard about it and kept it secret, not knowing what it refers to. I hope that the Master will overflow with enthusiasm and fully explain this matter so that it may continue without extinction, last for a long time, and can the way of Heaven be understood? Tsih Bo bowed his head twice and answered, Indeed, you are asking about the way of Heaven, and this is because of the times of abundance and decline.</p>
<p>2: 帝曰：願聞天道六六之節盛衰何也。歧伯曰：上下有位，左右有紀。故少陽之右，陽明治之。陽明之右，太陽治之。太陽之右，厥陰治之。厥陰之右，少陰治之。少陰之右，太陰治之。太陰之右，少陽治之。此所謂氣之標，蓋南面而待也。故曰：因天之序，盛衰之時，移光定位，正立而待之，此之謂也。少陽之上，火氣治之，中見厥陰。陽明之上，燥氣治之，中見太陰。太陽之上，寒氣治之，中見少陰。厥陰之上，風氣治之，中見少陽。少陰之上，熱氣治之，中見太陽。太陰之上，濕氣治之，中見陽明。所謂本也。本之下，中之見也。見之下，氣之標也。本標不同，氣應異象。
The Emperor asked, I wish to hear about the phases of the Heavenly Dao of sixes. What does it mean for them to flourish and decline? The Duke replied, Above and below have their positions, and left and right have their records. Therefore, on the right of Shao Yang, Yang Ming governs; on the right of Yang Ming, Tai Yang governs; on the right of Tai Yang, Jue Yin governs; on the right of Jue Yin, Shao Yin governs; on the right of Shao Yin, Tai Yin governs; and on the right of Tai Yin, Shao Yang governs. This is called the marker of Qi, which stands facing south. Therefore, he said, According to the order of Heaven, in the periods of flourishing and decline, moving the marker and setting up the position, standing upright and waiting, this is what it means.</p>
<p>Shao Yang governs above, treating with fire Qi; in the middle, one sees Jue Yin. Yang Ming governs above, treating with dry Qi; in the middle, one sees Tai Yin. Tai Yang governs above, treating with cold Qi; in the middle, one sees Shao Yin. Jue Yin governs above, treating with wind Qi; in the middle, one sees Shao Yang. Shao Yin governs above, treating with hot Qi; in the middle, one sees Tai Yang. Tai Yin governs above, treating with damp Qi; in the middle, one sees Yang Ming. What is called the origin is above. The origin is below; in the middle, one sees the marker. Below the marker, there are changes; in the changes, one sees the Qi's marker. Different markers bring different changes.</p>
<p>3: 帝曰：其有至而至，有至而不至，有至而太過，何也。歧伯曰：至而至者和。至而不至，來氣不及也。未至而至，來氣有餘也。帝曰：至而不至，未至而至，如何。歧伯曰：應則順，否則逆，逆則變生，變則病。帝曰：善。請言其應。歧伯曰：物，生其應也。氣，脈其應也。
The Emperor asked: What do you mean by having arrived and not having arrived? And what is the meaning of arriving beyond the limit?  Duke Huan replied: Arriving and being in harmony is arrived. Not arriving, it means insufficient qi. Not yet arrived but already there, the qi has excess. The Emperor asked again: Not arriving when one should have arrived, and arriving before one should, how is this? Duke Huan replied: It is like obeying the proper time and acting accordingly; otherwise it will be reversed, leading to a change in generation and causing disease. The Emperor said: Good. Please explain more about what is appropriate. Duke Huan said: Everything has its appropriate time. Qi has its appropriate time in the pulse.</p>
<p>4: 帝曰：善。願聞地理之應六節氣位何如。歧伯曰：顯明之右，君火之位也。君火之右，退行一步，相火治之，復行一步，土氣治之，復行一步，金氣治之，復行一步，水氣治之，復行一步，木氣治之，復行一步，君火治之。相火之下，水氣承之。水位之下，土氣承之。土位之下，風氣承之。風位之下，金氣承之。金位之下，火氣承之。君火之下，陰精承之。帝曰：何也。歧伯曰：亢則害，承迺制，制則生化，外列盛衰，害則敗亂，生化大病。
The emperor said: Good. I wish to hear about the six qi positions in geomancy. Gobi said: The position of the displaying brightness is on the right, which represents the fire of the sovereign. To the right of the sovereign fire, retreat one step and treat the soil qi, then advance one step and treat the metal qi, then advance one step and treat the water qi, then advance one step and treat the wood qi, then retreat one step and treat the sovereign fire again. Underneath the fire phase, the water qi is borne. Underneath the water phase, the soil qi is borne. Underneath the earth phase, the wind qi is borne. Underneath the wind phase, the metal qi is borne. Underneath the metal phase, the fire qi is borne. Underneath the sovereign fire, the yin spirit nourishes. The emperor asked: What does this mean? Gobi said: If it rises and causes damage, it can be regulated and controlled, and regulation and control will lead to life-giving energy. Outwardly, there are fluctuations between prosperity and decline, but if it causes damage, it will lead to chaos, and a serious illness of life-giving energy will occur.</p>
<p>5: 帝曰：盛衰何如。歧伯曰：非其位則邪，當其位則正，邪則變甚，正則微。帝曰：何謂當位。歧伯曰：木運臨卯，火運臨午，土運臨四季，金運臨酉，水運臨子，所謂歲會，氣之平也。帝曰：非位何如。歧伯曰：歲不與會也。帝曰：土運之歲，上見太陰，火運之歲，上見少陽少陰，金運之歲，上見陽明，木運之歲，上見厥陰，水運之歲，上見太陽，柰何。歧伯曰：天之與會也。故《天元冊》曰：天符。天符歲會何如。歧伯曰：太一天符之會也。帝曰：其貴賤何如。歧伯曰：天符為執法，歲位為行令，太一天符為貴人。帝曰：邪之中也柰何。歧伯曰：中執法者，其病速而危。中行令者，其病徐而特。中貴人者，其病暴而死。帝曰：位之易也何如。歧伯曰：君位臣則順，臣位君則逆，逆則其病近，其害速，順則其病遠，其害微，所謂二火也。
Emperor asked: What is the harmony between prosperity and decline? Duke of Zhou replied: If not in its proper place, it's wrong; when in its proper place, it's right. Wrong leads to great changes, while right brings about subtlety. Emperor asked: What does being in its proper place mean? Duke of Zhou replied: When the Wood element is in its time, it corresponds with the Chen (June 5-20) and Xu (July 5-20) solar terms; when the Fire element is in its time, it corresponds with the Li (Summer solstice) and Xia (July 21-August 7) solar terms; when the Earth element is in its time, it corresponds with the Yi (Autumn equinox), Chou (September 23-October 7), and Ping (November 7-22) solar terms; when the Metal element is in its time, it corresponds with the Dao (Winter solstice); when the Water element is in its time, it corresponds with the Hai (December 22-January 6). What about it? Duke of Zhou replied: This is how heaven brings order to the cycle. The Heavenly Canon says, The Symbol of Heaven. What does the cycle of the Heavenly Canon mean? Duke of Zhou replied: It's the symbol of the Great Ultimate's harmony. Emperor asked: What about its nobility and base nature? Duke of Zhou replied: The Symbol of Heaven serves as the law, the cycle of time serves as the orders, and the Great Ultimate is noble. Emperor asked: What about being wrong within it? Duke of Zhou replied: Those who implement the law will become sick quickly and face danger; those who carry out orders will become sick gradually but surely. Those who are noble will become sick suddenly and die. Emperor asked: What about the changing nature of its proper place? Duke of Zhou replied: If a ruler is submissive to his ministers, it will be harmonious, and if a minister is submissive to his ruler, it will be orderly. When it's orderly, the sickness will be distant, and the harm will be minor; when it's chaotic, the sickness will be near, and the harm will come quickly. This is called two fires.</p>
<p>6: 帝曰：善。願聞其步何如。歧伯曰：所謂步者，六十度而有奇，故二十四步積盈百刻而成日也。帝曰：六氣應五行之變何如。歧伯曰：位有終始，氣有初中，上下不同，求之亦異也。帝曰：求之柰何。歧伯曰：天氣始於甲，地氣始於子，子甲相合，命曰歲立，謹候其時，氣可與期。
The Emperor said, Good. I wish to hear about the way his steps are. Hui Biao said, What is meant by 'steps' is a cycle of sixty with oddities, so twenty-four cycles are enough to fill up a hundred markers and make a day. The Emperor said, How does the six qi correspond with the change of the five elements? Hui Biao replied, There are positions of beginning and end, and the qi has beginnings and middles; above and below they are different, seeking them is also different. The Emperor asked, How can one seek them? Hui Biao replied, Heavenly qi begins with A, earthly qi begins with B. A and B correspond, and they are called seasonal periods. Be careful of the time, and the qi can be matched to a date.</p>
<p>7: 帝曰：願聞其歲六氣始終早晏何如。歧伯曰：明乎哉問也。甲子之歲，初之氣天數始於水下一刻，終於八十七刻半。二之氣始於八十七刻六分，終於七十五刻。三之氣始於七十六刻，終於六十二刻半。四之氣始於六十二刻六分，終於五十刻。五之氣始於五十一刻，終於三十七刻半。六之氣始於三十七刻六分，終於二十五刻。所謂初六，天之數也。乙丑歲初之氣天數始於二十六刻，終於一十二刻半。二之氣始於一十二刻六分，終於水下百刻。三之氣始於一刻，終於八十七刻半。四之氣始於八十七刻六分，終於七十五刻。五之氣始於七十六刻，終於六十二刻半。六之氣始於六十二刻六分，終於五十刻。所謂六二，天之數也。丙寅歲，初之氣天數始於五十一刻，終於三十七刻半。二之氣始於三十七刻六分，終於二十五刻。三之氣始於二十六刻，終於一十二刻半。四之氣始於一十二刻六分，終於水下百刻。五之氣始於一刻，終於八十七刻半。六之氣始於八十七刻六分，終於七十五刻。所謂六三，天之數也。丁卯歲，初之氣天數始於七十六刻，終於六十二刻半。二之氣始於六十二刻六分，終於五十刻。三之氣始於五十一刻，終於三十七刻半。四之氣始於三十七刻六分，終於二十五刻。五之氣始於二十六刻，終於一十二刻半。六之氣始於一十二刻六分，終於水下百刻。所謂六四，天之數也。次戊辰歲，初之氣復始於一刻，常如是無已，周而復始。帝曰：願聞其歲候何如。歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也。日行一周，天氣始於一刻，日行再周，天氣始於二十六刻，日行三周，天氣始於五十一刻，日行四周，天氣始於七十六刻，日行五周，天氣復始於一刻，所謂一紀也。是故寅午戌歲氣會同，卯未亥歲氣會同，辰申子歲氣會同，覽巳酉丑歲氣會同，終而復始。
Emperor: I want to hear about the six phases of life at sixty years old. Kuai Bo replied, This is truly a remarkable question.

In the Year of Fire and Earth (Astrological year), the Initial Qi's duration starts from 76 minutes and lasts until 62.5 minutes. The second phase of Qi starts at 62.67 minutes and lasts until 50 minutes. The third phase of Qi starts at 50.14 minutes and lasts until 37.5 minutes. The fourth phase of Qi starts at 37.67 minutes and lasts until 25 minutes. The fifth phase of Qi starts at 26 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. The sixth phase of Qi starts at 12.67 minutes and lasts until the moment before conception. This is referred to as the Six Four, representing the number of celestial stems.
In the Year of Earth and Water (Astrological year), the Initial Qi's duration restarts from the moment of conception, constantly repeating without end, returning to the beginning once again. Emperor: I want to hear about the seasonal phases. Kuai Bo replied, This is truly a remarkable question. 
In one cycle, the phase of Qi starts at the moment of conception and lasts until 87.5 minutes. In two cycles, the phase of Qi starts at 26 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. In three cycles, the phase of Qi starts at 51 minutes and lasts until 12.5 minutes. In four cycles, the phase of Qi starts at 76 minutes and lasts until</p>
<p>8: 帝曰：願聞其用也。歧伯曰：言天者求之本，言地者求之位，言人者求之氣交。帝曰：何謂氣交。歧伯曰：上下之位，氣交之中，人之居也。故曰：天樞之上，天氣主之，天樞之下，地氣主之，氣交之分，人氣從之，萬物由之，此之謂也。
The Emperor said, I wish to hear about its use. Hui-Bô said, Speaking of Heaven is seeking its origin, speaking of Earth is seeking its position, speaking of man is seeking his breath and vitality. The Emperor asked, What do you mean by 'breath and vitality?' Hui-Bô replied, The arrangement of above and below, the balance of breath and vitality is where people reside. Therefore, it is said that above the pivot (of Heaven), Heaven governs through its breath and vitality, below the pivot, Earth governs through its breath and vitality. The division of breath and vitality is where people draw from, and all things originate from this.</p>
<p>9: 帝曰：何謂初中。歧伯曰：初凡三十度而有奇，中氣同法。帝曰：初中何也。歧伯曰：所以分天地也。帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯曰：初者，地氣也，中者，天氣也。帝曰：其升降何如。歧伯曰：氣之升降，天地之更用也。帝曰：願聞其用何如。歧伯曰：升已而降，降者謂天。降已而升，升者謂地。天氣下降，氣流于地，地氣上升，氣騰于天，故高下相召，升降相因，而變作矣。
Emperor said: What is the meaning of initial and central? Huihui said: The initial stage refers to 30 degrees, with some oddity, and the central stage corresponds in terms of law. Emperor asked: What do you mean by initial and central? Huihui said: The initial phase refers to the earth's qi, and the central phase refers to the heaven's qi. Emperor asked: How does it ascend and descend? Huihui said: The ascending and descending of qi corresponds with the alternating use of heaven and earth. Emperor asked: How about its usage? Huihui said: After it has ascended, it descends, and when it descends, it is called heaven. After it has descended, it ascends, and when it ascends, it is called earth. When the qi of heaven descends, the qi flows to the earth, and when the qi of earth ascends, it leaps in the sky, so high and low call upon each other, and the ascending and descending cause change.</p>
<p>10: 帝曰：善。寒濕遘溝，燥熱相臨，風火相值，其有聞乎。歧伯曰：氣有勝復，勝復之作，有德有化，有用有變，變則邪氣居之。帝曰：何謂邪乎。歧伯曰：夫物之生從於化，物之極由乎變，變化之相薄，成敗之所由也。故氣有往復，用有遲速，四者之有而化而變，風之來也。帝曰：遲速往復，風所由生，而化而變，故因盛衰之變耳。成敗倚伏遊乎中，何也。歧伯曰：成敗倚伏生乎動，動而不已，則變作矣。帝曰：有期乎。歧伯曰：不生不化，靜之期也。帝曰：不生化乎。歧伯曰：出入廢則神機化滅，升降息則氣立孤危。故非出入，則無以生長壯老已，非升降，則無以生長化收藏。是以升降出入，無器不有。故器者生化之宇，器散則分之，生化息矣。故無不出入，無木升降。化有小大，期有近遠，四者之有而貴常守，反常則災害至矣。故曰無形無患，此之謂也。帝曰：善。有不生不化乎。歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也。與道合同，惟真人也。帝曰：善。
The Emperor said: Good. Cold and dampness pass through gullies, heat and drought are adjacent, wind and fire are mutual, do you know anything about it? Duke of Zhou said: The Qi has victory and defeat, the work of victory and defeat has virtue and transformation, has use and change, only then does evil Qi reside. What do you mean by evil? Duke of Zhou said: It is because things are born from transformation, extremes arise from change, the thinness of change is the cause of success or failure, therefore when Qi has coming and going, action has slowness and swiftness, all four have existence and transform and change, it is the wind. The Emperor said: Slowness and swiftness have coming and going, wind arises, and transforms and changes, so they change due to abundance and scarcity. Success and failure lean on the middle, what does this mean? Duke of Zhou said: Success and failure lean on movement, moving without stopping, then transformation occurs. The Emperor said: Is there a limit? Duke of Zhou said: Not being born or transformed is stillness, which is the limit. The Emperor said: Not being born transformed? Duke of Zhou said: If you discard upward and downward, then the spirit transforms and disappears; if you do not regulate breathing, then the Qi stands alone in peril. Therefore, not discarding upward and downward, there is no container without use. The vessel is the place of generating Qi, and when the vessel scatters, it divides, thus generating Qi. Therefore, there is no not having upward and downward, no wood does not have rising and falling. Transformation has small and great, periods have near and far, all four exist with a container, guarding the constant, reversing is a disaster. Therefore, it is said that formlessness has no harm, this is what is meant by it. The Emperor said: Good. Is there not being born or transformed? Duke of Zhou said: You have thoroughly asked about this matter. Merging with the way, only true people are able to do so. The Emperor said: Good</p>
