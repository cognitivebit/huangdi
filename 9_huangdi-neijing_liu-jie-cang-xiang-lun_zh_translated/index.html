<h1 id="_1">六節藏象論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝問曰：余聞天以六六之節，以成一歲，人以九九制會，計人亦有三百六十五節以為天地久矣，不知其所謂也。歧伯對曰：昭乎哉問也，請遂言之。夫六六之節，九九制會者，所以正天之度、氣之數也。天度者，所以制日月之行也；氣數者，所以紀化生之用也。
The Yellow Emperor asked, saying: I have heard that Heaven uses the sixes and sixes to complete one year, and humans use nines and nines for meetings, and they also count three hundred sixty-five nodes as a way to express the longevity of heaven and earth. I do not know what it means. The Duke answered: How enlightened your question is! Please proceed with your explanation. The sixes and sixes of Heaven's nodes, and the nines and nines for meetings are used to regulate the measure of Heaven's degrees and the number of its energy. The degrees of Heaven are used to govern the movement of the sun and moon; the energy numbers are used to record the use of the myriad things in heaven and earth</p>
<p>2: 天為陽，地為陰；日為陽，月為陰。行有分紀，周有道理，日行一度，月行十三度而有奇焉，故大小月三百六十五日而成歲積氣餘而盈閏矣。立端於始，表正於中，推餘於終，而天度畢矣。
Heaven is yang, Earth is yin; day is yang, month is yin. There are records of movements and reasons for cycles. The sun completes one cycle and the moon completes thirteen cycles, which results in anomalies. Therefore, the large and small months total 365 days and complete a year's accumulation of energy with some remaining, thus there is a leap year. Establishing the beginning, displaying the middle, and pushing the remainder to the end, and the heavenly cycle is completed.</p>
<p>3: 帝曰：余已聞天度矣，願聞氣數何以合之。歧伯曰：天以六六為節，地以九九制會，天有十日，日六竟而周甲，甲六復而終歲，三百六十日法也。夫自古通天者，生之本，本於陰陽。其氣九州九竅，皆通乎天氣。故其生五，其氣三，三而成天，三而成地，三而成人，三而三之，合則為九，九分為九野，九野為九藏，故形藏四，神藏五，合為九藏以應之也。
Emperor said: I have already heard about the Heaven's order, and wish to know how many breaths there are in order to merge them. Duke of Yi said: The Heaven arranges by sixes, the Earth establishes by nines. There are ten days in the Heaven, the Sun goes six steps before it revolves around and completes a year, three hundred and sixty days are its law. As for those who have communicated with the Heaven from ancient times, their origin lies in Yin and Yang. Their energy flows through the nine provinces and nine orifices, all connected to the Heaven's energy. Therefore, when one is born, they possess five energies; when three combine, they become Heaven; when three combine, they become Earth; when three combine, they become humans; when three combine again, they make nine, which are then divided into nine wildernesses, and these wildernesses contain the nine treasures. Thus, there are four form treasures and five spirit treasures, combining to total the nine treasures that correspond with the Heaven.</p>
<p>4: 帝曰：余已聞六六九九之會也，夫子言積氣盈閏，願聞何謂氣。請夫子發蒙解惑焉。歧伯曰：此上帝所秘，先師傳之也。帝曰：請遂聞之。歧伯曰：五日謂之候，三候謂之氣，六氣謂之時，四時謂之歲，而各從其主治焉。五運相襲，而皆治之，終朞之日，周而復始，時立氣布，如環無端，候亦同法。故曰：不知年之所加，氣之盛衰，虛實之所起，不可以為工矣。
Emperor said: I have heard of the 669 Gathering, and you mentioned accumulating qi to fullness, asking for an explanation of what it means. Please, Master Zhou, dispel my confusion. Zhou replied: This is something the Emperor has kept secret and passed down through the sages. Emperor said: I would like to hear more about it. Zhou said: A day refers to a phase, three phases refer to qi, six qis refer to time, four times refer to a year, and each treats its master accordingly. The five cycles influence each other, and all are treated accordingly until everything is exhausted and then returns to the beginning, establishing the qi arrangement, like a circle without end. Therefore, one cannot create works without knowing how much a year has been added, the waxing and waning of qi, and what causes the rise or fall of emptiness and reality.</p>
<p>5: 帝曰：五運之始，如環無端，其太過不及何如。歧伯曰：五氣更立，各有所勝，盛虛之變，此其常也。帝曰：平氣何如？歧伯曰：無過者也。帝曰：太過不及奈何。歧伯曰：在經有也。帝曰：何謂所勝。歧伯曰：春勝長夏，長夏勝冬，冬勝夏，夏勝秋，秋勝春，所謂得五行時之勝，各以氣命其藏。帝曰：何以知其勝。歧伯曰：求其至也，皆歸始春，未至而至，此謂太過，則薄所不勝，而乘所勝也，命曰氣淫。不分邪僻內生，工不能禁。至而不至，此謂不及，則所勝妄行，而所生受病，所不勝薄之也，命曰氣迫。所謂求其至者，氣至之時也。謹候其時，氣可與期，失時反候，五治不分，邪僻內生，工不能禁也。帝曰：有不襲乎。歧伯曰：蒼天之氣，不得無常也。氣之不襲，是謂非常，非常則變矣。帝曰：非常而變柰何。歧伯曰：變至則病所，勝則微，所不勝則甚，因而重感於邪，則死矣。故非其時則微，當其時則甚也。
Emperor: The beginning of the five phases is like a circle without an endpoint, and exceeding this is not good. Duke of Shao said: The five energies are established in their own strength, each having its own victory, the change between excess and deficiency is what is constant. Emperor asked: What is the balance like? Duke of Shao said: It has no excess. Emperor asked: What about too much? Duke of Shao said: There is a saying in the classics. Emperor asked: What do you mean by victory? Duke of Shao said: Spring triumphs over summer, summer triumphs over autumn, autumn triumphs over summer, summer triumphs over winter, and winter triumphs over spring; this refers to obtaining the five phases' time of victory, each controlling the spirit of its corresponding energy. Emperor asked: How do you know it is victorious? Duke of Shao said: Seek perfection, all will return to the beginning of spring, not yet reached but already arrived, which refers to exceeding the limit and triumphing in that which is weak, called chaotic energy. Not dividing good and evil, internal generation, skill cannot restrain. Already arrived but not yet arrived, which means not victorious, resulting in false actions and the illness suffered by what is weak, called pressing energy. That which seeks perfection refers to the time when energy is complete. Be careful of the time, energy can be anticipated; miss the time and reverse, the five treatments will not be divided, evil internal generation, skill cannot restrain. Emperor: Is there no end to it? Duke of Shao said: The energy of the sky and earth has no constancy. Energy without end is what is not constant, and thus changes. Emperor asked: What does changing mean? Duke of Shao said: Changing leads to illness, victory leads to mildness, what is not victorious leads to seriousness, causing people to pay more attention to evil, leading to death. Therefore, if it is not the time, it is mild, and if it is the time, it becomes serious.</p>
<p>6: 帝曰：善。余聞氣合而有形，因變以正名。天地之運，陰陽之化，其於萬物，孰少孰多，可得聞乎。歧伯曰：悉哉問也，天至廣不可度，地至大不可量，大神靈問，請陳其方。草生五色，五色之變，不可勝視；草生五味，五味之美，不可勝極，嗜欲不同，各有所通。天食人以五氣，地食人以五味。五氣入鼻，藏於心肺，上使五色脩明，音聲能彰。五味入口，藏於腸胃，味有所藏，以養五氣，氣和而生津液相成，神乃自生。
The emperor said: Good. I have heard that qi gathers and forms a shape, transforms and gives rise to the name through changes. The movement of heaven and earth, the transformation of yin and yang, how much is there in myriad things, can it be fully understood? Duke Huan asked: This is indeed a profound question. Heaven is vast and cannot be measured, and earth is immense and cannot be quantified. Great spirits ask about this, please explain the method. Grass produces five colors, the changes of these colors are beyond sight; grass produces five flavors, the sweetness of these flavors is beyond measure, desires differ, each has its own path. Heaven feeds people with five qi, and earth nourishes people with five flavors. The five qi enter the nose, are stored in the heart and lungs, and make the five colors clearer, the sounds audible. The five flavors enter the mouth, are stored in the stomach and intestines, the flavor has its own storage, nourishing the five qi, when the qi is harmonious, body fluids are produced, and spirit arises.</p>
<p>7: 帝曰：藏象何如。歧伯曰：心者，生之本，神之變也，其華在面，其充在血脈，為陽中之太陽，通於夏氣。肺者，氣之本，魄之處也，其華在毛，其充在皮，為陽中之太陰，通於秋氣。腎者，主蟄封藏之本，精之處也，其華在髮，其充在骨，為陰中之少陰，通於冬氣。肝者，罷極之本，魂之居也，其華在爪，其充在筋，以生血氣，其味酸，其色蒼，此為陽中之少陽，通於春氣。脾胃大腸小腸三焦膀胱者，倉廩之本，營之居也，名曰器，能化糟粕，轉味而入出者也，其華在脣四白，其充在肌，其味甘，其色黃，此至陰之類通於土氣。凡十一藏取決於膽也。
The Emperor asked: How is the storage of the dragon? The Grand Preceptor replied: The heart, being the source of life and spirit, has its brilliance in its face and its fullness in the blood vessels; it is the yang within the yang and reaches the qi of summer. The lungs, being the root of breath and soul, have their brilliance in the hair and their fullness in the skin; they are the yang within the yin and reach the qi of autumn. The kidneys, ruling over the concealed storage, are the place of essence; they have their brilliance in the nails and their fullness in the bones, being the yin within the yin and reaching the qi of winter. The liver is the source of extremes and the dwelling of the soul; it has its brilliance in the claws and its fullness in the tendons, generating blood and qi, with a sour taste and a bluish hue, being the yang within the yin and reaching the qi of spring. The spleen, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, three junctions, bladder are the depots of granaries, dwelling places of transformation; they are called organs, able to transform dregs and change flavors as they enter and exit, with their brilliance in the lips and whiteness, their fullness in the muscles, having a sweet taste and yellow hue, being the essence of yin and reaching the qi of earth. The storage of all eleven organs depends on the gallbladder.</p>
<p>8: 故人迎一盛病在少陽，二盛病在太陽，三盛病在陽明，四盛已上為格陽。寸口一盛，病在厥陰，二盛病在少陰，三盛病在太陰，四盛已上為關陰。人迎與寸口俱盛四倍已上為關格，關格之脈贏，不能極於天地之精氣，則死矣。
Originally, there was a person who had three bouts of illness: one at Shao Yang, another at Tai Yang, and the third at Yang Ming. After the fourth bout, it became a Gan Yang. He then experienced four bouts of illness at Jue Yin, two at Shaoyin, and three at Taijing, after which it became Guan Yin. When both Gan Yang and Jue Yin reached fourfold increase, they became Guan Gui (Relation between the channels). If the pulse in this relation is not strong enough to prevail over the vital qi of heaven and earth, then one will surely die.</p>
