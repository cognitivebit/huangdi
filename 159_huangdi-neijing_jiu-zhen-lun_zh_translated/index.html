<h1 id="_1">九鍼論</h1>
<p>1: 黃帝曰：余聞九鍼於夫子，眾多博大矣，余猶不能寤，敢問九鍼焉生，何因而有名？歧伯曰：九鍼者，天地之大數也，始於一而終於九。故曰：一以法天，二以法地，三以法人，四以法時，五以法音，六以法律，七以法星，八以法風，九以法野。
Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that there are nine needles from Confucius, and they are numerous and profound. However, I still cannot sleep peacefully. I dare to ask how the nine needles came into being and why it has such a reputation? Hui Bao replied: The nine needles refer to the great number of heaven and earth, starting from one and ending at nine. Therefore, one is for the law of heaven, two is for the law of earth, three is for the law of man, four is for the law of time, five is for the law of sound, six is for the law of law, seven is for the law of stars, eight is for the law of wind, and nine is for the law of wilderness.</p>
<p>2: 黃帝曰：以鍼應九之數，奈何？歧伯曰：夫聖人之起天地之數也，一而九之，故以立九野。九而九之，九九八十一，以起黃鍾數焉，以鍼應數也。
Yellow Emperor said: According to the divination of the nine numbers, what do you think? Duke of Zhou said: The sacred person originated from the number of heaven and earth. One is the foundation of nine, so he established the Nine Numbers. Nine again by nine, resulting in 9981, starting the Yellow Bell numerology, which is the divination of the yarrow stalks</p>
<p>3: 一者，天也。天者，陽也。五藏之應天者肺，肺者，五藏六府之蓋也，皮者，肺之合也，人之陽也。故為之治鍼，必以大其頭而銳其末，令無得深入而陽氣出。
First, there is Heaven. Heaven refers to the Yang. The five organs correspond to Heaven, and the lung corresponds to the five organs and six departments. The skin is the gathering of the lung, representing the Yang of a person. Therefore, when treating acupuncture, it must be done by making the head larger and sharpening the end, so that there is no way for it to penetrate deep and let the Yang Qi out.</p>
<p>4: 二者，地也。人之所以應土者，肉也。故為之治鍼，必筩其身而員其末，令無得傷肉分，傷則氣得竭。
Both are earth. The reason people submit to the earth is their flesh. Therefore, when treating acupuncture needles, one must elevate their body and insert at the end, ensuring that there is no harm to the flesh. If there is damage, then qi will be exhausted.</p>
<p>5: 三者，人也。人之所以成生者，血脈也。故為之治鍼，必大其身而員其末，令可以按脈物陷，以致其氣，令邪氣獨出。
The three, one is man. Man's achievement of life comes from blood vessels. Therefore, in treating acupuncture, one must expand the body and fill the extremities, allowing the needles to press on the vessels to raise the Qi, driving out evil Qi.</p>
<p>6: 四者，時也。時者，四時八風之客於經絡之中，為瘤病者也。故為之治鍼，必筩其身而鋒其末，令可以寫熱出血，而痼病竭。
Among the four, it is time. Time refers to the four times and eight winds as guests in the channels, being patients with nodules. Therefore, when treating them with acupuncture needles, one must stand their bodies upright and sharpen their tips, allowing them to dispel heat and bleeding, so that the disease will be completely cured.</p>
<p>7: 五者，音也。音者，冬夏之分，分於子午，陰與陽別，寒與熱爭，兩氣相搏，合為癰膿者也。故為之治鍼，必令其末如劍鋒，可以取大膿。
Five [constellations], [representing] sound. The sound is the division between winter and summer, divided into zi and mwu, with yin and yang being distinct, cold and heat competing, two energies fighting against each other, culminating in a boil or abscess. Therefore, for the treatment of such conditions, one must make sure that the needle's tip is as sharp as a knife, so that it can drain the abscess.</p>
<p>8: 六者，律也。律者，調陰陽四時而合十二經脈，虛邪客於經絡而為暴痺者也。故為之治鍼，必令尖如釐，且員其銳，中身微大，以取暴氣。
Six of them are related to the (Chinese) system. The system refers to balancing yin and yang at the four times, resulting in twelve channels/meridians. In cases where pathogenic factors invade and disturb the channels/meridians, causing pain or paralysis, acupuncture treatment is necessary. Needles should be fine and sharp like a needle, and should target the affected areas precisely to remove the blocked energy.</p>
<p>9: 七者，星也。星者，人之七竅，邪之所客於經，而為痛痺，合於經絡者也。故為之治鍼，令尖如蚊虻喙，靜以徐往，微以久留，正氣因之，真邪俱往，出鍼而養者也。
Seven [points] are stars. Stars refer to the seven orifices of humans, where evil resides according to the classics, and causes pain and paralysis, merging with the channels. Therefore, treatment involves acupuncture, with needles pointed like a mosquito's proboscis, slowly advancing and staying for a long time, regulating Qi through it, differentiating between true and false, and cultivating after removing the needle.</p>
<p>10: 八者，風也。風者，人之股肱八節也。八正之虛風，八風傷人，內舍於骨解腰脊節腠理之間為深痺也。故為之治鍼，必長其身，鋒其末，可以取深邪遠痺。
Eight [points] are the wind. The wind is the eight channels of the knee and elbow. When the channels of the Eight Points are deficient, the wind harms people, causing deep pain in the muscles, tendons, and joints between the lumbar vertebrae. Therefore, for this treatment, one must pierce with an acupuncture needle, lengthen the needle, and sharpen its tip to remove deep pathogenic factors and heal the distant pain.</p>
<p>11: 九者，野也。野者，人之節解皮膚之間也。淫邪流溢於身，如風水之狀，而留不能過於機關大節者也。故為之治鍼，令尖如挺，其鋒微員，以取大氣之不能過於關節者也。
Nine, it means wild. Wild refers to the spaces between the joints of a person's bones and skin. Lewd and evil qi overflow the body, similar to the state of wind and water. They cannot be overcome by the larger joints. Therefore, acupuncture is used to treat them, making the needles sharp like spears, with tiny tips to target the areas where the qi cannot overcome the joints.</p>
<p>12: 黃帝曰：鍼之長短有數乎？歧伯曰：一曰鐵鍼者，取法於巾鍼，去末寸半，卒銳之，長一寸六分，主熱在頭身也。二曰員鍼，取法於絮鍼，筩其身而卵其鋒，長一寸六分，主治分間氣。三曰鍉鍼，取法於黍粟之銳，長三寸半，主按脈取氣，令邪出。四曰鋒鍼，取法於絮鍼，筩其身，鋒其末，長一寸六分，主癰熱出血。五曰鈹鍼，取法於劍鋒，廣二分半，長四寸，主大癰膿，兩熱爭者也。六曰員利鍼，取法於釐鍼，微大其末，反小其身，令可深內也，長一寸六分。主取癰痺者也。七曰毫鍼，取注于毫毛，長一寸六分，主寒熱痛痺在絡者也。八曰長鍼，取法於綦鍼，長七寸，主取深邪遠痺者也。九曰大鍼，取法於鋒鍼，其鋒微員，長四寸，主取大氣不出關節者也。鍼形畢矣，此九鍼大小長短法也。
Yellow Emperor said: Is there a standard for the length of acupuncture needles? Qi Bo replied: One, iron needle, patterned after the arrow, shorten by half an inch and sharpen it, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used to treat head and body heat. Two, moxa needle, patterned after the thistle needle, cover its body and place its tip on the acupoint, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used for treating between the joints qi. Three, hook needle, patterned after the sharp end of millet or wheat, with a length of three and a half inches, used for pressing the pulse and exhaling evil, expelling it. Four, knife-edge needle, patterned after the thistle needle, cover its body and sharpen its tip, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used for treating heat rash and bleeding. Five, chisel needle, patterned after the knife, with a broad tip of two and a half divisions, with a length of four inches, used for treating large heat boils and abscesses, for yin and yang contending. Six, moxa-assisted needle, patterned after the cautery needle, refine its tip and reduce its body size, making it suitable for deep insertion, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used for treating heat rash stiffness and pain. Seven, hair follicle needle, patterned after the hair follicles, with a length of one inch and six divisions, used to treat cold, heat, pain, and numbness in tendons. Eight, long needle, patterned after the silk needle, with a length of seven inches, used for treating deep evil and distant stiffness and pain. Nine, large needle, patterned after the knife-edge needle, with its tip slightly smaller, with a length of four inches, used to treat blocked qi not coming out at the joints. The forms of needles are now complete, and this is the standard for the nine types of long and short needles.</p>
<p>13: 黃帝曰：願聞身形，應九野，奈何？歧伯曰：請言身形之應九野也，左足應立春，其日戊寅己丑。左脅應春分，其日乙卯。左手應立夏，其日戊辰己巳。膺喉首頭應夏至，其日丙午。右手應立秋，其中戊申己末。右脅應秋分，其日辛酉。右足應立冬，其日戊戌己亥。腰尻下竅應冬至，其日壬子。六府膈下三藏應中州，其大禁，大禁太一所在之日，及諸戊己。凡此九者，善候八正所在之處。所主左右上下身體有癰腫者，欲治之，無以其所直之日潰治之，是謂天忌日也。
Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the auspiciousness of the body, according to what nine situations? Huan Bo said: Please explain the auspiciousness of the body according to the nine situations. The left foot corresponds to the beginning of spring (Wood), on the day of Wuxu and Jinchen. The left elbow corresponds to the Vernal Equinox (Water), on the day of Bingchen. The left hand corresponds to summer (Fire), on the day of Wudou and Gengzi. The breast, throat, and head correspond to the summer solstice (Earth), on the day of Renren. The right hand corresponds to autumn (Metal), in the middle of the month, on the day of Xinchou. The right elbow corresponds to the Autumn Equinox (Water), on the day of Jichou. The right foot corresponds to winter (Water), on the day of Wuxu and Jixu. The lower back corresponds to the winter solstice (Fire), on the day of Rishen. All six palaces and three storage areas correspond to the Central Plains, with the main capital being where the Grand Taboo is located on days governed by Yin and Yang. These nine positions are all places of good timing for the Eight Positives. The person in charge of these left, right, up, and down parts of the body who has bumps or swellings wishes to treat them, but there is no day to directly cure them; this is called the heavenly prohibition day.</p>
<p>14: 形東志苦，病生於脈，治之於灸刺。形苦志東，病生於筋，治之以熨引。形東志東，病生於肉，治之以鍼石。形苦志苦，病生於咽喝，治之以甘藥。形數惊恐，筋脈不通，病生於不仁，治之以按摩謬藥。是謂形。
The text discusses the treatment of various conditions based on the patient's symptoms. </p>
<ol>
<li>If there is form (脈) pain and the symptom points to the east (形東志苦，病生於脈，治之於灸刺), it indicates a condition that causes discomfort in the form (脈) and manifests in the east. Treatment involves acupuncture and moxibustion.</li>
<li>If there is form pain with eastward pointing (形苦志東，病生於筋，治之以熨引), it indicates a condition that causes discomfort in the form and manifests in the east, affecting the tendons. Treatment involves steaming and pulling.</li>

</ol>
<p>15: 五藏氣，心主噫，肺主咳，肝主語，脾主吞，腎主欠。
Five Organs govern Qi, the heart governs the tongue, the lungs govern coughing, the liver governs speech, the spleen governs swallowing, and the kidneys govern deficiency.</p>
<p>16: 六府氣，膽為怒，胃為氣逆穢，大腸小腸為泄，膀胱不約為遺溺，下焦溢為水。
The six departments [organs] of Qi, courage becomes anger, the stomach becomes Qi stagnation and foulness, the large intestine and small intestine become discharge, the bladder does not bind for leakage, lower abdomen overflowing as water.</p>
<p>17: 五味：酸入肝，辛入肺，苦入心，甘入脾，鹹入腎，淡入胃，是謂五味。
Five Flavors: Sour enters the liver, bitter enters the heart, sweet enters the spleen, salty enters the kidneys, and bland enters the stomach.</p>
<p>18: 五并：精氣并肝則憂，并心則喜，并肺則悲，并腎則恐，并脾則畏，是謂五精之氣，并於藏也。
The Five Congruences: When the vital energy gathers in the liver, it causes sadness; when it gathers in the heart, it brings joy; when it gathers in the lungs, it causes sorrow; when it gathers in the kidneys, it induces fear; and when it gathers in the spleen, it provokes awe. These are the five types of vital energy that gather within the storehouse (of organs).</p>
