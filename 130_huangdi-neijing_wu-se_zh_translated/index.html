<h1 id="_1">五色</h1>
<p>1: 雷公問於黃帝曰：五色獨決於明堂乎？小子未知其所謂也。黃帝曰：明堂者，鼻也；闕者，眉間也；庭者，顏也；蕃者，頰側也；蔽者，耳門也。其間欲方大，去之十步，皆見於外，如是者壽，必中百歲。
Lei Gong asked Yellow Emperor: Is the decision of the five colors made in the Bright Hall? The boy does not know what it means. Yellow Emperor said: The Bright Hall is the nose; the threshold is between the eyebrows; the courtyard is the face; the border is at the corner of the eye; and the screen is the ear gate. If one can fit all these into a small space, remove it by ten steps, and see everything from outside, such a person will live to be 100 years old.</p>
<p>2: 雷公曰：五言之辨，奈何？黃帝曰：明堂骨高以起，平以直，五藏次於中央，六府挾其兩側，首面上於闕庭，王宮在於下極，五藏安於胸中，真色以致，病色不見，明堂潤澤以清，五官惡得無辨乎？
Lei Gong said: How shall I judge five-character phrases? Huang Di replied: The Hall of Light is raised high, with a level and straight base; the Five Organs are placed in the center, with the Six Ministries flanking them on either side. The supreme countenance is above the gateway, the Royal Palace is situated below. The Five Organs are secure within the chest, the true form is manifested, and the sickly appearance does not show. Is it not to be regretted that the Hall of Light is damp and overgrown, and the Five Senses are hard to discern?</p>
<p>3: 雷公曰：其不辨者，可得聞乎？黃帝曰：五色之見也，各出其色部。部骨陷者，必不免於病矣。其色部乘襲者，雖病甚，不死矣。
Lei Gong said: For those who cannot discern it, can you hear about it? The Yellow Emperor said: For the five colors of appearance, each has its color department. If the bone department is sunken, there will be no escape from illness. If the color department is invaded, although the illness is severe, one will not die.</p>
<p>Translation: Lei Gong asked if those who cannot recognize it can hear about it. The Yellow Emperor replied that each of the five colors has a corresponding color department. If the bone department is sunken, one cannot escape from illness. If the color department is attacked, although the illness may be severe, one will not die.</p>
<p>4: 雷公曰：官五色奈何？黃帝曰：青黑為痛，黃赤為熱，白為寒，是謂五官。
Lei Gong said: What about the five organs? Huang Di said: Green and black are for pain, yellow and red are for fever, white is for cold. These are the five organs.</p>
<p>5: 雷公曰：病之益甚，與其方衰，如何？黃帝曰：外內皆在焉。切其脈口，滑小緊以沉者，病益甚，在中；人迎氣大緊以浮者，其病益甚，在外。其脈口浮滑者，病日進；人迎沉而滑者，病日損。其脈口滑以沉者，病日進，在內；其人迎脈滑盛以浮者，其病日進，在外。脈之浮沉及人迎與寸口氣小大等者，病難已；病之在藏，沉而大者，易已，小為逆；病在府，浮而大者，其病易已。人迎盛堅者，傷於寒，氣口盛堅者，傷於食。
Lei Gong said: The illness is very severe. Should I let it decline? Huang Di replied: It's both inside and outside. If you cut the pulse groove and find that it is shallow, tight, and sinking, the illness is more severe within; if when you greet the breath it is large and tight, indicating that the illness is more severe externally. If the pulse groove is shallow and sinking but still smooth, the illness will progress daily and be internal; if when you greet the breath the pulse is deep and smooth, the illness will progress daily and be external. When the pulse is shallow and sinking but still smooth, the illness will progress daily and be internal; when you greet the pulse and it is deep and smooth with abundance, indicating that the illness is more severe externally, its course will progress daily and be external. If the float and sink of the pulse or the fullness and tightness of the breath at the inch point indicate difficulty, the illness is incurable; if the illness is in the storehouse and deep with abundance, it is easier to cure and smaller in extent; if the illness is in the office and shallow with abundance, it will be easier to cure. If you greet the breath and find it full and firm, you have harmed yourself with cold; if when you greet the breath it is large and firm at the mouth of the breath, you have harmed yourself with food.</p>
<p>6: 雷公曰：以色言食之間甚，奈何？黃帝曰：其色麤以明，沉夭者為甚，其色上行者，病益甚；其色下行，如雲徹散者，病方已。五色各有藏部，有外部有內部也。色從外部走內部者，其病從外走內；其色從內走外者，其病從內走外。病生於內者，先治其陰，後治其陽，反者益甚。其病生於陽者，先治其外，後治其內，反者益甚。其脈滑大，以代而長者，病從外來，目有所見，志有所惡，此陽氣之並也，可變而已。
Lei Gong said: Regarding the use of color and flavor, what should be done? Huang Di replied: The color can be used to clarify, but if it is too deep or sinking, there will be a problem; the color moving upward means that the disease is getting worse; the color moving downward is like dispersing clouds, meaning the disease has improved. Each of the five colors has a hidden and an outer part. The color comes from the outer part to the inner part, indicating that the disease comes from the outside to the inside; the color coming from the inner part to the outer part indicates that the disease comes from the inside to the outside. If the disease arises from the inside, first treat the yin and then treat the yang; if it is reversed, it will become worse. If the disease arises from the yang, first treat the outside and then treat the inside; if it is reversed, it will become worse. If the pulse is slippery and large and prolonged, indicating that the disease comes from the outside, there are visible symptoms and aversion to something, this is the confluence of Yang Qi and can be transformed.</p>
<p>7: 雷公曰：小子聞風者，百病之始也；厥逆者，寒濕之起也，別之奈何？黃帝曰：常候闕中，薄澤為風，沖濁為痺。在地為厥。此其常也；各以其色言其病。
Lei Gong said: Little one, hearing the sound of wind is the beginning of a hundred diseases; perverse persons are born from cold and dampness. How can they be separated? The Yellow Emperor said: Constantly attend to the pulse in the guiding vessels, distinguish the light and heavy pulses as wind and cold. In the body, there are those that are always present. One can speak of their illnesses through their colors.</p>
<p>8: 雷公曰：人不病卒死，何以知之？黃帝曰：大氣入于藏府者，不病而卒死矣。雷公曰：病小愈而卒死者，何以知之？黃帝曰：赤色出兩顴，大如拇指者，病雖小愈，必卒死。黑色出於庭，大如拇指，必不病而卒死。
Master Lü said: How do we know when a person will die without falling ill? The Emperor said: Qi enters the viscera, and one can die without being ill. Master Lü said: When someone who is sick recovers but still dies, how do we know this? The Emperor said: If there is a red spot the size of a grain of rice appearing in two places, the person will recover from the illness but surely die. If there is a black spot the size of a grain of rice appearing in the courtyard, the person will surely die without being ill.</p>
<p>9: 雷公再拜曰：善哉！其死有期乎？黃帝曰：察色以言其時。雷公曰：善乎！願卒聞之。黃帝曰：庭者，首面也；闕上者，咽喉也；闕中者，肺也；下極者，心也；直下者，肝也；肝左者，膽也；下者，脾也；方上者，胃也；中央者，大腸也；挾大腸者，腎也；當腎者，臍也；面王以上者，小腸也，面王以下者，膀胱子處也；顴者，肩也；顴後者，臂也；臂下者，手也；目內眥上者，膺乳也；挾繩而上者，背也；循牙車以下者，股也；中央者，膝也；膝以下者，脛也；當脛以下者，足也；巨分者，股裏也；巨屈者，膝臏也。此五藏六府肢節之部也，各有部分。有部分，用陰和陽，用陽和陰，當明部分，萬舉萬當。能別左右，是謂大道；男女異位，故曰陰陽。審察澤夭，謂之良工。
Lei gong again paid his respects and said, Excellent! Is there a set time for death? The Yellow Emperor said, By observing the color and timing, one can determine the time. Lei gong said, Good! I would like to hear it again. The Yellow Emperor said, The courtyard is the forehead; the upper part of the gateway is the throat; the inside of the gateway is the lungs; the lower extreme is the heart; the directly below is the liver; the left of the liver is the gallbladder; below is the spleen; the upper part is the stomach; the center is the large intestine; holding the large intestine is the kidney; in front of the kidney is the pancreas; above the face of the face is the small intestine, and below the face of the bladder is the bladder; the shoulder is the shoulder; behind the shoulder is the arm; below the arm is the hand; the inner corner of the eye upwards is the armpit; holding the tendon and going up is the back; below the teeth grinding wheel is the thigh; the center is the knee; below the knee is the shin; at the bottom of the shank is the foot; the large division is the groin; the large bend is the knee; these are the joints of the limbs and parts of the five viscera and six ministries. Each has its own part. Having parts, using yin and yang, using yang and yin, understanding the parts, everything is clear. Being able to distinguish left and right is called the Great Way; men and women have different positions, so it is called yin and yang. Examining the muscles and tendons, it is called a skillful craftsman.</p>
<p>10: 沉濁為內，浮澤為外。黃赤為風，青黑為痛，白為寒，黃而膏潤為膿，赤甚者為血痛，甚為攣，寒甚為皮不仁。五色各見其部，察其浮沉，以知淺深；察其澤夭，以觀成敗；察其散搏，以知遠近；視色上下，以知病處；積神於心，以知往今。故相氣不微，不知是非，屬意勿去，乃知新故。色明不麤，沉天為甚，不明不澤，其病不甚。其色散，駒駒然，未有聚；其病散而氣痛，聚未成也。
The sunken is within, the swollen is without. Yellow and red are wind, green and black are pain, white is cold. Yellow and slippery is pus, reddish and severe is bleeding, much is straining, very cold is skin not tender. The five colors each see their part, examine their sunken and swollen, to know shallow or deep; examine their decayed, to observe success or failure; examine their scattered and contracted, to know near or far; look at the color above and below, to know where the disease is; accumulate the mind in the heart, to know past and present. Thus not knowing if it's correct or incorrect, belong to intention, do not depart from it, then know new matters. The clear colors are not confused, sunken too much, not clear or swollen, the disease will not be serious. The color is scattered, hurriedly, not yet gathered; the disease is scattered and pain in the breath, not yet gathered.</p>
<p>11: 腎乘心，心先病，腎為應，色皆如是。
The kidney governs the heart, and the heart is affected first when sickness occurs; the kidney responds to changes, and all appearances are similarly so.</p>
<p>12: 男子色在于面王，為小腹痛；下為卵痛；其圜直為莖痛，高為本，下為首，狐疝㿉陰之屬也。女子在于面王，為膀胱子處之病，散為痛，搏為聚，方員左右，各如其色形。其隨而下至胝，為淫，有潤如膏狀，為暴食不潔。
For males, pain in the color area is due to the face king. Below it is pain from the egg, and its directness represents the pain of the penis, highness represents the root, below which is the head, and it belongs to the fox tail and yin. For females, it is in the color area and is due to the bladder's lower position disease, scattered as pain, contracted as gathering, with both sides looking like its shape and form. As it descends to the lower abdomen, it represents lust, with lubrication resembling a state of excess, representing excessive eating and lack of cleanliness.</p>
<p>13: 左為左，右為右。其色有邪，聚散而不端，面色所指者也。色者，青黑赤白黃，皆端滿有別鄉。別鄉赤者，其色赤，大如榆莢，在面王為不日。其色上銳，首空上向，下銳下向，在左右如法。以五色命藏，青為肝，赤為心，白為肺，黃為脾，黑為腎。肝合筋，心合脈，肺合皮，脾合肉，腎合骨也。
Left is left, right is right. Its color has evil, gathering and dispersing without being in order, it refers to the complexion. The colors are green, black, red, white, and yellow, all of which have their own distinct origins. The origin of red is the color red, as large as a reed sprout, located at the king's forehead. Its color is sharp upward, and empty space downward, situated left and right in accordance with law. By commanding the five colors, green represents the liver, red represents the heart, white represents the lungs, yellow represents the spleen, and black represents the kidneys. The liver merges with tendons, the heart merges with vessels, the lungs merge with skin, the spleen merges with flesh, and the kidneys merge with bones.</p>
