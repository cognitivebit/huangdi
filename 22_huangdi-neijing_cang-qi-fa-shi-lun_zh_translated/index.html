<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：合人形以法四時五行而治，何如而從，何如而逆，得失之意，願聞其事。歧伯對曰：五行者，金木水火土也，更貴更賤，以知死生，以決成敗，而定五藏之氣，間甚之時，死生之期也。帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯曰：肝主春，足厥陰少陽主治，其日甲乙，肝苦急，急食甘以緩之。心主夏，手少陰太陽主治，其日丙丁，心苦緩，急食酸以收之。脾主長夏，足太陰陽明主治，其日戊己，脾苦濕，急食甘以緩之。心主夏，手少陰太陽主治，其日丙丁，心苦緩，急食酸以收之。脾主長夏，足太陰陽明主治，其日戊己，脾苦濕，急食苦以燥之。肺主秋，手太陰陽明主治，其日庚辛，肺苦氣上逆，急食苦以泄之。腎主冬，足少陰太陽主治，其日壬癸，腎苦燥，急食辛以潤之，開腠理，致津液，通氣也。
Yellow Emperor asked, Treating with the Five Phases of the Five Activities in order to regulate, what is it like following this approach and what is it like going against it?

More exalted and more base, used to know life and death, used to determine success and failure, and to govern the five organs' energy, at a critical time, for life and death periods. Emperor said, I want to hear this quickly. The Duke said, The liver governs spring, the foot's yin and yang of the treatment govern treat, its days are yin and yang. The liver is bitter and urgent, eat sweet to moderate. The heart governs summer, the hand's yin of the great Yang govern treat, its days are bing and ding. The heart is bitter and slow, eat sour to collect. The spleen governs long summer, the foot's yin and Yang Ming of the treatment govern treat, its days are wood and metal. The spleen is bitter and damp, eat sweet to moderate. The heart governs summer, the hand's yin of the great Yang govern treat, its days are bing and ding. The heart is bitter and slow, eat sour to collect. The spleen governs long summer, the foot's yin and Yang Ming of the treatment govern treat, its days are wood and metal.

The illness is in the heart, and it gets worse during the long summer. The long summer does not improve; rather, it's even worse than winter. Winter doesn't kill, and it continues into spring, starting anew in summer. To treat this condition, one should follow a regimen of moderate temperature, food, and clothing. For those with heart illnesses, recovery occurs during the years of Earth (Wu) and Metal (Jin), but if there is no recovery in Earth and Metal, it can be sustained in Yin Wood (Jia and Geng) and emerge in Yang Wood (Bing and Ding). A person with a heart condition will feel more acute symptoms during the daytime and have relief at midnight. At dawn, they should be quiet.

If not recovered by autumn, it is more severe than spring, and if not cured by spring, it persists through summer, beginning in the long summer season. One must avoid hot and humid places, wear dry clothes, refrain from excessive eating and drinking, and maintain a temperate diet. For spleen diseases that do not recover in the period of Metal (Gengxin), add Wood (JiaYi) to the treatment, but if it still does not cure, continue with Fire (BingDing), starting in Soil (WuYin). Those who are ill should rise early and retire early. If the spleen is weak, eat sweet foods to strengthen it, use bitter foods to regulate it, and use sour foods as a supplement.</p>

Punish those who commit crimes of fire and heat, food, clothing. For kidney disease patients, recover in the yin months (Jia Yi), if not recovered in Jia Yi, it is more difficult in the metal months (Wu Xu), if not dead in Wu Xu, it persists into the water months (Geng Xin), and begins in the wood months (Ren Gui).

<p>夫邪氣之客於身也，以勝相加，至其所生而愈，至其所不勝而甚，至於所生而持，自得其位而起。必先定五藏之脈，乃可言間甚之時，死生之期也。
When evil qi enters the body, it increases by conquering the surface and becomes more severe when it is generated.

</li>
<li>
<p>脾病者，身重善肌肉痿，足不收，行善瘈，腳下痛，虛則腹滿腸鳴，飱泄食不化，取其經，太陰陽明少陰血者。
