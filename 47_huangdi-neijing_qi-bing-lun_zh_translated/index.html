<h1 id="_1">奇病論</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問曰：人有重身，九月而瘖，此為何也。歧伯對曰：胞之絡脈絕也。帝曰：何以言之。歧伯曰：胞絡者繫於腎，少陰之脈，貫腎繫舌本，故不能言。帝曰：治之奈何。歧伯曰：無治也，當十月復。刺法曰：無損不足，益有餘，以成其疹，然後調之。所謂無損不足者，身羸瘦，無用鑱石也；無益其有餘者，腹中有形而泄之，泄之則精出而病獨擅中，故曰疹成也。
Emperor Yellow asked, A person has a heavy body and becomes sick in the ninth month. What is the reason for this? The Duke answered, It is due to the disruption of the fetal cord. Emperor Yellow asked, How can it be described? The Duke said, The fetal cord attaches to the kidney, the source of the yin essence, passing through the kidney and connecting to the tongue. Therefore, one cannot speak. Emperor Yellow asked, What is the treatment for this? The Duke said, There is no cure; it will resolve by itself in the tenth month. Acupuncture says, It is a condition without damage or excess. Treatment consists of promoting the body's natural healing abilities by reinforcing the deficiency and allowing the rash to develop fully before addressing it. The term 'without damage or excess' refers to a weakened body that does not require the use of jade stones. In this case, there is an internal mass within the abdomen that is expelled, leading to the expulsion of essence and the disease becoming entrenched in the body, causing the rash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：病脇下滿氣逆，二三歲不已，是為何病。歧伯曰：病名曰息積，此不妨於食，不可灸刺，積為導引服藥，藥不能獨治也。
The Emperor said: This illness causes a fullness and reversal below the ribs, lasting for days in children aged two or three. What is this disease called? Minister Qi replied: The disease is called Accumulation. It does not hinder eating, and should not be treated with acupuncture or moxibustion. Accumulation is a guide for administering medicine, and the medicine cannot cure the condition alone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation: Emperor: What kind of disease causes fullness and reversal below the ribs in children aged two or three that lasts for days? Minister Qi: It's called Accumulation. It doesn't affect eating and should not be treated with acupuncture or moxibustion. Accumulation is a guide for administering medicine, but it cannot cure the condition alone.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>帝曰：人有身體髀股䯒皆腫，環齊而痛是為何病。歧伯曰：病名曰伏梁，此風根也，其氣溢於大腸，而著於肓，肓之原在齊下，故環齊而痛也。不可動之，動之，為水溺濇之病也。
The emperor asked: People have bodily hip joints that swell and are painful, and they are all around the area, so why is it due to which disease? Hua Bo responded: The name of the disease is Fu Ling. This is a Wind pathogen, and its Qi rises to the large intestine, causing it to attach to the muscles. The root of the muscles is at the lower part of the back, so that's why there is pain around the area. It should not be moved, but if moved, it becomes a disease of water drowning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：人有尺脈數甚，筋急而見，此為何病。歧伯曰：此所謂疹筋，是人腹必急，白色黑色見，則病甚。
The Emperor said: A person's pulse has various sizes, and when the sinews are tense, it is visible. What kind of disease is this? Hui-Bo replied: This is called Jin Jing, a condition where the abdomen is urgent, and white or black colors are seen; in such cases, the illness is severe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：人有病頭痛以數歲不已，此安得之，名為何病。歧伯曰：當有所犯大寒，內至骨髓，髓者以腦為主，腦逆故令頭痛，齒亦痛。病名曰厥逆。帝曰：善。
The Emperor said: A person has a headache and pain that does not cease with age, what is this called? The Duke of Zhou replied: There must be an attack of great cold, spreading inside to the bone marrow. Bone marrow, which serves as the root for the brain, causes the headache because it is twisted. Teeth also hurt. This disease is called severe twist. The Emperor said: Good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：有病口甘者，病名為何，何以得之。歧伯曰：此五氣之溢也，名曰脾癉。夫五味入口，藏於胃，脾為之行其精氣，津液在脾，故令人口甘也；此肥美之所發也，此人必數食甘美而多肥也，肥者令人內熱，甘者令人中滿，故其氣上溢，轉為消渴。治之以蘭，除陳氣也。
Emperor: What is the disease of someone who likes to eat bitter things? What is it called, and how does one get it? Duke of Zhou: This is an excess of the Five Qi, known as the spleen. When the five flavors enter the mouth, they are stored in the stomach. The spleen moves the vital energy, and fluids reside in the spleen, thereby causing a person's mouth to taste bitter. This is the source of being overweight and enjoying sweet things; such people have eaten many sweet and rich foods, leading them to become overweight. Being overweight causes internal heat, and sweetness causes a feeling of fullness. As a result, their vital energy rises in excess, leading to thirst. Treatment involves using orchid (蘭) to disperse stagnant qi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：有病口苦，取陽陵泉，口苦者病名為何，何以得之。歧伯曰：病名曰膽癉。夫肝者中之將也，取決於膽，咽為之使。此人者，數謀慮不決，故膽虛氣上溢，而口為之苦。治之以膽募俞，治在陰陽十二官相使中。
Emperor: There is a person with a painful sore throat. They have taken water from Yangling Spring, yet the pain in their throat persists. What is this person's condition called, and how did they contract it? Minister Qi replied: The condition is called gallbladder confluence. The liver sends out a message, and the gallbladder responds by concentrating it. This person has been pondering and worrying for some time without making any decisions, which has caused their gallbladder to become deficient in Qi, causing it to rise upwards, resulting in throat pain. The treatment is to strengthen the gallbladder with Gui Piao, and the remedy lies in the communication between the Yin and Yang of the Twelve Organ Networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：有癃者，一日數十溲，此不足也；身熱如炭，頸膺如格，人迎躁盛，喘息氣逆，此有餘也，太陰脈微細如髮者，此不足也。其病安在，名為何病。歧伯曰：病在太陰，其盛在胃頗在肺，病名曰厥，死不治。此所謂得五有餘二不足也。帝曰：何謂五有餘，二不足。歧伯曰：所謂五有餘者五病之氣有餘也；二不足者，亦病氣之不足也。今外得五有餘內得二不足，此其身不表不裏，亦正死明矣。
The emperor said: Someone has symptoms where they are ill for a day or two with fever, and this is not enough. The body temperature is high like charcoal, the neck muscles feel like sandbags, the person has a strong smell coming from them, and their breathing is heavy and shallow, showing that they have excess energy. The small yin pulse is weak and faint, which is not enough. Where are they sick and what is this illness called?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Huo Bo said: They are sick with small yin, the excess energy is in the stomach and slightly in the lungs. This disease is called qi and is fatal if untreated. This is what is meant by having five excesses and two deficiencies.</p>
<p>The emperor asked: What are the five excesses and two deficiencies? Huo Bo said: The five excesses refer to having excess energy in the five diseases, while the two deficiencies refer to a lack of energy in the diseases. If someone has both the five excesses inside and the two deficiencies outside, it means their body is not expressing what's going on within them, and this clearly signifies death.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>帝曰：人生而有病巔疾者，病名曰何，安所得之。歧伯曰：病名為胎病，此得之在母腹中時，其母有所大驚，氣上而不下，精氣并居，故令子發為巔疾也。
The Emperor asked: Of those born, who are afflicted with diseases and disorders, what are they called, and how did they come to have them? Duke Mu replied: They are called 'uterine diseases.' These are acquired when the mother is greatly surprised while pregnant. Her vital energy ascends and does not descend; her essence and vital energy both gather, causing the child to be born with diseases and disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：有病痝然如有水狀，切其脈大緊，身無痛者，形不瘦不能食，食少，名為何病。歧伯曰：病生在腎，名為腎風。腎風而不能食善驚，驚已，心氣痿者死。帝曰：善。
The Emperor asked: There is a disease where one's body becomes limp like a corpse, but there is no pain when the pulse is taken. The person cannot gain weight nor can they eat, and they eat little; what is this disease called? Duke of Shou replied: The disease originates from the kidney, and it is called kidney wind. If one has kidney wind and cannot eat well, and it becomes an emergency, then if the vital energy of the heart weakens, death will ensue. The Emperor said: Very good.</p>
</li>
</ol>
