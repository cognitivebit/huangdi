The Records of the Changes:</p>
<p>The Record of Origin (发生之纪) describes Jǐ (启), the beginning of heaven and earth, where yin and yang are balanced and the political order is harmonious. There is a peaceful flow of qi energy in all things, and the virtues are manifested. Yang Qi ascends, while yin Qi descends, creating a balance between the two energies that govern the universe. The political order is firm but not rigid, and there is no confusion or disorder. The land flourishes, and all creatures thrive in harmony. The colors of the fruits are bright and vibrant, their flavors pure and sweet, and the seasons are mild and pleasant. The Record of the Classics (赫曦之纪) describes Yángpíng (荣茂), a period when yin energy is concentrated within and Yang Qi shines externally. There is a balance between the two energies, but with a greater emphasis on Yang energy. The political order is strong and just, but not oppressive, and the qi energy of all creatures flows smoothly. The colors of fruits are rich and varied, their flavors spicy and salty, and the seasons are hot and sunny. The Record of Changes (敦阜之纪) describes Hòudìng (厚德), an era characterized by a deep understanding of yin and yang energies. There is a balance between the two energies, but with more emphasis on the virtues and moral values that govern society. The political order is just and fair, and there is no confusion or disorder. All creatures thrive in harmony, and their colors are muted and subdued, with flavors that are mild and bland. The Record of Concealment (流衍之纪) describes Shěn (封藏), an era when yin energy is dominant and the political order is more oppressive and rigid. There is a greater emphasis on controlling people's actions and restricting their freedom. All creatures are subdued, and their colors are dark and somber, with flavors that are bitter or salty. The seasons are cold and harsh, and the qi energy of all creatures is stagnant and unhealthy.</p>
<p>The above translations are from the I Ching, which is a classic Chinese text that dates back to around 1000 BCE. It is used for divination and guidance in decision-making and life choices. The text describes different periods or eras characterized by different balances of yin and yang energies, with each era having its own unique characteristics in terms of the political order, qi energy flow, virtues, and the colors, flavors, and seasons.</p>
<p>4: 帝曰：天不足西北，左寒而右涼，地不滿東南，右熱而左溫，其故何也。歧伯曰：陰陽之氣，高下之理，太少之異也。東南方，陽也，陽者其精降於下，故右熱而左溫。西北方，陰也，陰者其精奉於上，故左寒而右涼。是以地有高下，氣有溫涼，高者氣寒，下者氣熱。故適寒涼者脹之，溫熱者瘡，下之則脹已，汗之則瘡已，此湊理開閉之常，太少之異耳。帝曰：其於壽夭何如。歧伯曰：陰精所奉其人壽，陽精所降其人夭。帝曰：善。其病也，治之柰何。歧伯曰：西北之氣散而寒之，東南之氣收而溫之，所謂同病異治也。故曰：氣寒氣涼，治以寒涼，行水漬之。氣溫氣熱，治以溫熱，強其內守。必同其氣，可使平也，假者反之。
The Emperor asked: Why are the heavenly principles of yin and yang not balanced in the west and north, with cold on the left and heat on the right, and on earth, the south and east being hot while the north and west are cold? The Duke of Zhou replied: This is due to the different qualities of the energy of yin and yang. In the south and east, it is yang energy, which causes its essence to descend below, resulting in heat on the right and warmth on the left. In the west and north, it is yin energy, which causes its essence to pay homage above, resulting in cold on the left and coolness on the right. Therefore, there are high and low energies, with warmth and coolness. When something adapts to cold and heat, the body's cavities expand, and when there is warmth and heat, it produces boils; once the cavities have expanded and the boils have formed, this is the natural opening and closing of the body's pores, a manifestation of too little energy. The Emperor asked: How does this relate to life and death? The Duke of Zhou replied: The essence of yin causes people to live longer, and the descending essence of yang causes people to die earlier. The Emperor asked: Good. What should be done to treat the disease? The Duke of Zhou said: The energy of the west is dispersed and cold, while the energy of the south is concentrated and warm. This is what is meant by treating similar diseases differently. Therefore, for energy that is cold and energy that is warm, treat with coolness and heat respectively, and regulate water astringency. For energy that is warm and energy that is hot, strengthen the interior guard. If you can harmonize their energies, it will be beneficial, but if you misjudge this, the opposite will occur.</p>
<p>5: 帝曰：善。一州之氣生化壽夭不同，其故何也。歧伯曰：高下之理地勢使然也。崇高則陰氣治之，污下則陽氣治之，陽勝者先天，陰勝者後天，此地理之常，生化之道也。帝曰：其有壽夭乎。歧伯曰：高者其氣壽，下者其氣夭，地之小大異也，小者小異，大者大異。故治病者，必明天道地理，陰陽更勝，氣之先後，人之壽夭，生化之期，乃可以知人之形氣矣。
Emperor: What causes the longevity and death to vary among people in a single province?  Duke of Zhou: It is due to the differences in high and low positions. When one is esteemed, yin qi nourishes and governs them, while when one is despised, yang qi nourishes and governs them. The one who excels first in nature is yang, and the one who follows is yin; this is the constant way of land and growth. Emperor: Is there longevity and death? Duke of Zhou: Those who are esteemed have their qi leading to longevity, while those who are despised have their qi leading to death. The differences in small and great are due to the land, with small ones having smaller differences and large ones having greater differences. Therefore, when treating illnesses, one must understand heaven's way, the principles of yin and yang, the order of qi, the periods of life and death, and the growth cycles; only then can one discern a person's form and qi.</p>
<p>6: 帝曰：善。其歲有不病，而藏氣不應不用者，何也。歧伯曰：天氣制之，氣有所從也。帝曰：願卒聞之。歧伯曰：少陽司天，火氣下臨，肺氣上從，白起金用，草木眚，火見燔焫，革金且耗，大暑以行，欬嚏鼽衂鼻窒，曰瘍，寒熱胕腫。風行于地，塵沙飛揚，心痛胃脘痛，厥逆鬲不通，其主暴速。陽明司天，燥氣下臨，肝氣上從，蒼起木用而立，土迺眚，淒滄數至，木伐草萎，脇痛目赤，掉振鼓慄，筋痿不能久立。暴熱至，土迺暑，陽氣鬱發痛，小便變，寒熱如瘧，甚則心痛，火行于稿，流水不冰，蟄蟲迺見。太陽司天，寒氣下臨，心氣上從，而火且明，丹起金迺眚，寒清時舉，勝則水冰，火氣高明，心熱煩嗌乾，善渴鼽嚏，喜悲數欠，熱氣妄行，寒迺復，霜不時降，善忘甚則心痛。土迺潤，水豐衍，寒客至，沈陰化濕，氣變物水飲內蓄，中滿不食，皮𤸷肉苛，筋脈不利，甚則胕腫身後癰。厥陰司天，風氣下臨，脾氣上從，而土且隆，黃起水迺眚，土用革，體重肌肉萎，食減口爽，風行太虛，雲物搖動，目轉耳鳴。火縱其暴，地迺暑，大熱消爍，赤沃下，蟄蟲數見，流水不冰，其發機速。少陰司天，熱氣下臨，肺氣上從，白起金用，草木眚，喘嘔寒熱嚏鼽衂鼻窒，大暑流行，甚則瘡瘍燔灼，金爍石流。地迺燥清，淒滄數至，脇痛善太息，肅殺行，草木變。太陰司天，濕氣下臨，腎氣上從，黑起水變，埃冒雲雨，胸中不利，陰痿氣大衰而不起不用。當其時反腰脽痛，動轉不便也。厥逆，地迺藏陰，大寒且至，蟄蟲早附，心下否痛，地裂冰堅，少腹痛時害於食，乘金則止水增，味迺鹹，行水減也。
Emperor said: Good. At a certain age, one may not fall ill and yet the qi does not flow properly. What is the reason for this? The Duke of Zhou said: The celestial qi governs it, and there is indeed a source of qi. Emperor said: I would like to hear more about this. The Duke of Zhou said: The ShaoYang department controls heavenly qi; fire qi is below and lung qi is above, while gold has its uses, trees and grasses flourish, fire can burn and consume, great heat passes, sore throat, cough, snivel nose blocked, saying it's a boil, cold and hot swell and become bloated. The Yang Ming department controls heaven; parched qi is below, liver qi flows above, while blue uses wood and stands firm, earth sees grasses flourish, drought lasts for a long time, wood cuts trees and grasses wilt, side pain, red eyes, trembling, and rapid heartbeat, unable to stand for long. Extreme heat comes, earth sees great heat, Yang qi surges with pain, urination changes, cold and heat like plague, in extreme cases, there is side pain, fire acts on silk, water does not freeze, insects appear. The TaiYang department controls cold qi; heart qi flows above, while fire indeed shines brightly, gold accumulates below, clear times raise water, excellent cases cause ice, fire qi and heart heat, thirst, cough, sore throat, lacking joy, agitated qi acts chaotically, cold then comes, frost does not come at the right time, causing forgetfulness in extreme cases, heart pain. Earth sees moistness, water is abundant, cold clientizes and humidifies, qi changes water and fluid inside the body accumulates, unable to eat and skin and muscle become stiff, qi and vessels do not circulate well, in extreme cases, swelling of the lower back and boils appear. The JueYin department controls wind qi; spleen qi is below, while earth indeed flourishes, yellow uses water below, earth nourishes muscles, appetite decreases, saliva dries up, wind acts too much, objects shake, eyes turn and ears ring. Fire goes wild, earth sees heat, great heat destroys, red genitals appear, insects multiply, water does not freeze, the mechanism is fast. The ShaoYin department controls fire qi; lung qi is below, while gold has its uses, trees and grasses flourish, cough, cold and hot with sore throat, snivel nose blocked, saying it's a boil, great heat passes, skin of the back becomes red. Earth sees dryness, drought lasts for a long time, side pain is easily alleviated by deep breathing, while grasses change. The JueYang department controls water qi; kidney qi is below, while parched uses earth, black accumulates below, water changes into ice, rain clouds gather, there is no benefit inside the chest, yin weakens and wastes away, not rising or being used. When it's time, lower back and hip pain occurs, movement is difficult also. The TaiYin department controls dampness qi; bladder qi is below, while black accumulates below, water changes into ice, rain clouds gather, there is no benefit inside the chest, yin weakens and wastes away, not rising or being used. When it's time, lower back and hip pain occurs, movement is difficult also</p>
<p>7: 帝曰：歲有胎孕不育，治之不全，何氣使然。歧伯曰：六氣五類，有相勝制也，同者盛之，異者衰之，此天地之道，生化之常也。故厥陰司天，毛蟲靜，羽蟲育，介蟲不成，在泉，毛蟲育，倮蟲耗，羽蟲不育。少陰司天，羽蟲靜，介蟲育，毛蟲不成，在泉，羽蟲育，介蟲耗不育。太陰司天，倮蟲靜，鱗蟲育，羽蟲不成，在泉，倮蟲育，鱗蟲不成。少陽司天，羽蟲靜，毛蟲育，倮蟲不成，在泉，羽蟲育，介蟲耗，毛蟲不育。陽明司天，介蟲靜，羽蟲育，介蟲不成，在泉，介蟲育，毛蟲耗，羽蟲不成。太陽司天，鱗蟲靜，倮蟲育，在泉，鱗蟲耗，倮蟲不育。諸乘所不成之運，則甚也。故氣主有所制，歲立有所生，地氣制己勝，天氣制勝己，天制色，地制形，五類衰盛，各隨其氣之所宜也。故有胎孕不育治之不全，此氣之常也，所謂中根也。根于外者亦五，故生化之別，有五氣五味五色五類五宜也。帝曰：何謂也。歧伯曰：根于中者，命曰神機，神去則機息根于外者，命曰氣立，氣止則化絕。故各有制，各有勝，各有生，各有成。故曰：不知年之所加，氣之同異，不足以言生化，此之謂也。
Emperor: Why are there years with barren pregnancies, and why are some treatments incomplete? What principle governs this? </p>
<p>Duke of Zhou replied: The six Qi and five phases have the power to overcome each other. When something is predominant, it strengthens; when something is different, it weakens. This is the principle of Heaven and Earth, the constant of creation. Therefore, the Yin Palace governs Heaven in stillness, insects at rest, arthropods thriving, crustaceans not developing, in water, insects thrive, crustaceans consume, arthropods do not reproduce. The Lesser Yin governs Heaven in stillness, arthropods develop, insects do not take form, in water, arthropods thrive, crustaceans do not reproduce. The Lesser Yang governs Heaven in motion, insects are at rest, crustaceans develop, arthropods do not take form, in water, insects thrive, arthropods consume, arthropods do not reproduce. The Yang Ming governs Heaven in motion, crustaceans are at rest, arthropods reproduce, crustaceans do not develop, in water, crustaceans reproduce, arthropods consume, arthropods do not reproduce. The Greater Yang governs Heaven in motion, fish are at rest, insects reproduce, fish do not develop. The myriad phenomena that do not succeed are indeed rare. Therefore, there is a governing principle for the Qi, and certain seasons produce certain manifestations. The Heavenly Qi prevails over the Earthly Qi, and the Earthly Qi prevails over the Heavenly Qi. Heaven determines color, and Earth determines form. The five phases rise and fall according to their appropriate Qi. Each has its own governing principle, victory, production, and success. Thus, not knowing the influence of years and the difference between similar and dissimilar Qi is insufficient to explain the creation of life. This is what is meant by the mystery of the central root. The central root exists externally as well, giving rise to the distinction in creation, with five kinds of Qi, flavors, colors, phases, and manifestations according to their suitability. </p>
<p>Emperor: What do you mean? </p>
<p>Duke of Zhou replied: The central root is the spirit, and it is called the divine machine. If the spirit departs, then the vital force inherent in the external world ceases to function. When the Qi stops, life ends. Therefore, each has its own governing principle, victory, production, and success. Thus, not knowing the influence of years and the difference between similar and dissimilar Qi is insufficient to explain the creation of life. This is what I meant.</p>
<p>8: 帝曰：氣始而生化，氣散而有形，氣布而蕃育，氣終而象變，其致一也。然而五味所資，生化有薄厚，成熟有少多，終始不同，其故何也。歧伯曰：地氣制之也，非天不生，地不長也。帝曰：願聞其道。歧伯曰：寒熱燥濕，不同其化也。故少陽在泉，寒毒不生，其味辛，其治苦酸，其穀蒼丹。陽明在泉，濕毒不生，其味酸，其氣濕，其治辛苦甘，其穀丹素。太陽在泉，熱毒不生，其味苦，其治淡鹹，其穀黅秬。厥陰在泉，清毒不生，其味甘，其治酸苦，其穀蒼赤，其氣專，其味正。少陰在泉，寒毒不生，其味辛，其治辛苦甘，其穀白丹。太陰在泉，燥毒不生，其味鹹，其其氣熱，其治甘鹹，其榖黅秬。化淳則鹹守，氣專則辛化而俱治。
The Emperor asked: The Qi begins and there is life, the Qi disperses and it has form, the Qi spreads and herbs flourish, the Qi ends and the transformations are complete, its meaning is one. However, the resources of the Five Flavors affect the generation and completion of life, and whether they are abundant or sparse, and their beginning and end are different, why is this so? Duke of Shao replied: The Earth governs it, and it is not that the Heavens do not produce it, nor does the Earth prolong it. The Emperor said: I wish to hear its method. Duke of Shao said: Coldness and warmth, dryness and moistness, differ in their transformations. Therefore, Yin and Yang are present at springs, and the poison does not arise. Their flavors are bitter, and they treat acrid and bitter, their grains are red and yellow. Yin and Yang are present at springs, the damp poison does not arise, their flavors are sour, their Qi is moist, and they treat bitter and acrid, sweet, their grains are black and white. The Great Yang is present at springs, the heat poison does not arise, their flavor is bitter, and they treat bland and salty, their grains are green and yellow. The Lesser Yin is present at springs, the cold poison does not arise, their flavor is bitter, and they treat acrid and bitter, sweet, their grains are white and black. The Great Yin is present at springs, the arid poison does not arise, their flavor is salty, their Qi is hot, and they treat sweet and salty, their tools are green and yellow. When the transformations are pure, salt is preserved, and when the Qi is distinct, it becomes bitter and treats all.</p>
<p>9: 故曰：補上下者從之，治上下者逆之，以所在寒熱盛衰而調之。故曰：上取下取，內取外取，以求其過。能毒者以厚藥，不勝毒者以薄藥，此之謂也。氣反者，病在上，取之下，病在下，取之上，病在中，傍取之。治熱以寒，溫而行之，治寒以熱，涼而行之，治溫以清，冷而行之，治清以溫，熱而行之。故消之削之，吐之下之，補之寫之，久新同法。帝曰：病在中，而不實不堅，且聚且散，柰何。歧伯曰：悉乎哉問也。無積者求其藏，虛則補之，藥以袪之，食以隨之，行水漬之，和其中外，可使畢已。帝曰：有毒無毒，服有約乎。歧伯曰：病有久新，方有大小，有毒無毒，固宜常制矣。大毒治病，十去其六，常毒治病，十去其七，小毒治病，十去其八，無毒治病，十去其九。穀肉果菜，食養盡之，無使過之，傷其正也。不盡，行復如法，必先歲氣，無伐天和，無盛盛，無虛虛，而遺人天殃，無致邪，無失正，絕人長命。帝曰：其久病者，有氣從不康，病去而瘠，柰何。歧伯曰：昭乎哉聖人之問也。化不可代，時不可違。夫經絡以通，血氣以從，復其不足，與眾齊同，養之和之，靜以待時，謹守其氣，無使傾移，其形迺彰，生氣以長，命曰聖王。故大要曰：無代化，無違時，必養必和，待其來復，此之謂也。帝曰：善。
It is said: One who supplements above and below follows it, one who regulates above and below inverts it, using the location of cold and heat, deficiency and excess to adjust it. Therefore it is said: Taking from above and taking from below, seeking its excess. One who has poison uses thick medicine, one who is not overcome by poison uses thin medicine; this is what it means. Reversing Qi, the disease is in the upper part, take from the lower part; the disease is in the lower part, take from the upper part; the disease is in the middle, surround it from the outside. Treating heat with cold, let it circulate; treating cold with heat, cool it; treating warmth with clarity, let it circulate; treating clarity with warmth, let it circulate. Therefore eliminate it and weaken it, cause it to be expelled and eliminated, supplement it and fill it, this lasts for a long time. The Emperor said: The disease is in the middle but it is not firm nor solid, and it aggregates and disperses; what about that? The Duke of Shao said: Truly, you have asked a thorough question. Do not accumulate it; if empty, supplement it; if vacant, fill it with medicine; follow its changes, so as to bring the matter to an end. The Emperor said: There is poison and no poison, are there rules for taking medicine? The Duke of Shao said: Because diseases have varying degrees of acuteness and chronicity, and because they are poisonous or not poisonous, it is necessary to be cautious. Treating a great poison, subtract six; treating a constant poison, subtract seven; treating a small poison, subtract eight; treating a non-poisonous disease, subtract nine. Grains, meats, fruits and vegetables; nourish them completely so as not to harm them. Not fully nourishing leads to damage of the proper; repeating this results in damage at the seasonal level, without disturbing heaven's harmony, without abundance and scarcity, without being full or empty, and thus leaving behind a heritage of human calamity, without giving rise to perversity, without harming the natural course, severing human life and shortening their longevity. Therefore it is said: There are no substitutes for nature and there is no transgression of time. Nourishing and harmonizing must be present; awaiting the return of its coming and going, this is what it means. The Emperor said: Good.</p>
