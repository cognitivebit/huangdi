<h1 id="_1">刺節真邪</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>黃帝問于歧伯曰：余聞刺有五衛，奈何？歧伯曰：固有五衛，一曰振埃，二曰發蒙，三曰去爪，四曰徹衣，五曰解惑。黃帝曰：夫子言五衛，余未知其意。歧伯曰：振埃者，刺外經去陽病也；發蒙者，刺府俞，去府病也；去爪者，刺關節肢絡也；徹衣者，盡刺諸陽之奇俞也；解惑者，盡知調陰陽，補寫有餘不足，相傾移也。
Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, saying: I have heard that there are five needles. How about it? Qi Bo replied: Indeed, there are five needles: one is called vibrating needle, two is called sending-warmth needle, three is called removing-claw needle, four is called penetrating-robe needle, and five is called resolving-mystery needle. Yellow Emperor asked, If the master speaks of the five needles, I do not know their meaning. Qi Bo said: The vibrating needle is for external going out Yang disease; the sending-warmth needle is for ministerial office, removing ministerial disease; the removing-claw needle is for acupuncture at joints and tendons; the penetrating-robe needle is to fully acupuncture all the Yang's ministers; the resolving-mystery needle is to fully know regulating Yin and Yang, supplementing what has insufficiency, and making adjustments and moving accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：刺衛言振埃，夫子乃言刺外經，去陽病，余不知其所謂也。願卒聞之。歧伯曰：振埃者，陽氣大逆，上滿於胸中，憤瞋肩息，大氣逆上，喘喝坐伏，病惡埃煙，飼不得息，請言振埃，尚疾於振埃。黃帝曰：善。取之何如？歧伯曰：取之天容。黃帝曰：其咳上氣窮拙胸痛者，取之奈何？歧伯曰：取之廉泉。黃帝曰：取之有數乎？歧伯曰：取天容者，無過一里，取廉泉者，血變而止。帝曰：善哉。
Yellow Emperor said: Zhongjing's speech on Zhen Xuan, saying that Zhen Xuan can treat Yang disease and eliminate illness, which I do not know what it refers to. I hope to hear about it. Qi Bo replied: Zhen Xuan refers to the great reversal of Yang Qi, which is filled to the brim in the chest, with anger and resentment filling the shoulders, causing a strong Yang Qi to rise up, shortness of breath and panting while sitting or lying down, illness from bad vapor, not being able to breathe comfortably. When asked about Zhen Xuan, it is still more urgent than Zhen Xuan. Yellow Emperor said: Good. How should one take it? Qi Bo replied: Take it from Tian Contong. Yellow Emperor asked: For those who have difficulty coughing and gasping for breath, how should they take it? Qi Bo replied: Take it from Plain Well. Yellow Emperor said: Is there a limit to this? Qi Bo replied: Taking from Tian Contong has no more than one li, and taking from Plain Well will stop the bleeding when blood changes. Emperor praised: Excellent!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：刺衛言發蒙，餘不得其意。夫發蒙者，耳無所聞，目無所見，夫子乃言刺府俞，去府病，何輸使然，願聞其故。歧伯曰：妙乎哉問也。此刺之大約，鍼之極也，神明之類也，口說書卷，猶不能及也，請言發蒙耳，尚疾於發蒙也。黃帝曰：善。願卒聞之。歧伯曰：刺此者，必於日中，刺其聽宮，中其眸子，聲聞於耳，此其輸也。黃帝曰：善。何謂聲聞於耳？歧伯曰：刺邪以手堅按其兩鼻竅，而疾偃其聲，必應於鍼也。黃帝曰：善。此所謂弗見為之，而無目視，見而取之，神明相得者也。
Yellow Emperor said: The physician's explanation has deeply puzzled me, and I cannot grasp his meaning. The one who can comprehend it, there is nothing he has not heard or seen; you yourself have spoken of needles and moxibustion, removing the disease but not its cause; I wish to hear how this works. Hui Shi said: What a profound question! This great technique of needling is at the extreme limit of skill, involving divine insight, beyond what can be expressed in words or books; even so, asking about needling's method still falls short of its speed. Yellow Emperor said: Good. I wish to hear it explained further. Hui Shi said: The one who needles will do so at midday, inserting the needle into the ear palace and piercing the eyeballs, hearing sounds in the ears, this is what is transmitted. Yellow Emperor said: Good. What do you mean by hearing sounds in the ears? Hui Shi said: Needling falsely with a firm hand, pressing both nostrils closed, will quickly extract the sound, which must be applied with the needle. Yellow Emperor said: Good. This is what is called not seeing for it to happen, without eyesight, yet seizing and attaining divine insight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：刺衛言去爪，夫子乃言刺關節肢絡，願卒聞之。歧伯曰：腰脊者，身之大關節也；肢脛者，人之管以趨翔也；莖垂者，身中之機，陰精之候，津液之道也。故飲食不節，喜怒不時，津液內溢，乃下留於睪，血道不通，日大不休，俛仰不便，趨翔不能。此病榮然有水，不上不下，鈹石所取，形不可匿，常不得蔽，故命曰去爪。帝曰：善。
Emperor Yellow said: The palace attendant Zigong asked about the cause of the disease that had caused his fingers to become deformed. Zigong, there are three factors that contribute to this disorder, he explained. The first is a weak connection between your vertebrae in the lumbar region; the second is an unstable knee joint; and the third is the malfunction of the reproductive organs, which affect the movement of body fluids. Therefore, if you do not pay attention to your diet, or are hasty in expressing anger, the fluid will overflow into your extremities, causing blockage of the blood vessels, enlargement of the liver, difficulty bending over and standing straight, and impairment of movement. This disorder is known as 'disease of the deformed fingers.' Emperor Yellow said: I understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：刺衛言徹衣，夫子乃言盡刺諸陽之奇俞，未有常處也。願卒聞之。歧伯曰：是陽氣有餘，而陰氣不足，陰氣不足則內熱，陽氣有餘則外熱，內熱相搏，熱於懷炭，外畏綿帛近，不可近身，又不可近席。腠理閉塞，則汗不出，舌焦唇槁，腊乾益燥，飲食不讓美惡。黃帝曰：善。取之奈何？歧伯曰：取之於其天府大杼三痕，又刺中膂，以去其熱，補足手太陰，以去其汗，熱去汗稀，疾於徹衣。黃帝曰：善。
Yellow Emperor: The physician has pierced my clothes; you are speaking of the masterful handling of the special needles. There is no fixed location for them. I wish to hear more about this.
Qi Bo: The Yang Qi is excessive, while the Yin Qi is insufficient. If the Yin Qi is insufficient, there will be internal heat. If the Yang Qi is excessive, there will be external heat. When internal heat battles with external heat, the heat invades the pivot point, and externally one fears approaching cotton or silk materials too closely; it cannot be close to the body nor close to the seat. The marrow reasoning becomes blocked, so sweat does not come out, the tongue is parched and the lips are cracked, the limbs become dry and further heat accumulates. Food and drink do not taste good or bad.
Yellow Emperor: Good. How should I take it?
Qi Bo: Take it from its Jade Stove (Taiyang) at the Bao Zhong, Three Yin (San Jiao), and pierce the Zhongman. Remove the heat and supplement the foot Taiyang, remove the sweat, and when the heat is reduced and the sweat scant, it will be faster in piercing the clothes.
Yellow Emperor: Good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：刺衛言解惑，夫子乃言盡知調陰陽，補寫有餘不足，相傾移也，惑何以解之？歧伯曰：大風在身，血脈偏虛，虛者不足，實者有餘，輕重不得，傾側宛伏，不知東西，不知南北，乍上乍下，乍反乍復，顛倒無常，甚於迷惑。黃帝曰：善。取之奈何？歧伯曰：寫其有餘，補其不足，陰陽平復，用鍼若此，疾於解惑。黃帝曰：善。請藏之靈蘭之室，不敢妄出也。
Yellow Emperor said: Zangzi, you have explained the confusion. How can it be resolved? Zhangxi said: There is a great wind in the body, the blood vessels are weak, the weak parts lack sufficient and the strong parts have excess, light and heavy cannot be balanced, tilting to one side, unable to know east and west, unable to know south and north, constantly rising and falling, turning over and reversing, unstable, more confused than before. Yellow Emperor said: Good. How can it be taken? Zhangxi said: Write down its excesses and supplement its deficiencies, balance the yin and yang, and use acupuncture like this. It will be quick in resolving confusion. Yellow Emperor said: Good. Please keep it in the Spirits' Chamber, and dare not make a mistake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：余聞刺有五邪，何謂五邪？歧伯曰：病有持癰者，有容大者，有狹小者，有熱者，有寒者，是謂五邪。黃帝曰：刺五邪奈何？歧伯曰：凡刺五邪之方，不過五章，癉熱消滅，腫聚散亡，寒痺益溫，小者益陽；大者必去，請道其方。
Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that there are five evils in puncturing. What do you mean by the five evils? [The Master of the Gate of Virtue] said: There are those who have a persistent boil, those with a large swelling, those with a small swelling, those with fever, and those with cold. These are referred to as the five evils. Yellow Emperor asked: How should one deal with puncturing the five evils? [The Master of the Gate of Virtue] said: The method of puncturing the five evils does not exceed five chapters. For eliminating heat and dispelling, dispersing swellings and causing them to dissipate, warming up cold and stiffness, enlarging small ones, and reducing large ones while asking about their methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡刺癰邪，無迎隴，易俗移性。不得膿，脆道更行，去其鄉，不安處所乃散亡，諸陰陽過癰者，取之其輸寫之。
Anyone who is stabbed by a disease or evil will not be welcome. It is easy to become popular and change with the times. One cannot live without one's skin, and if one is forced to leave their homeland, they will eventually disperse and perish. Those who have too much yin and yang excesses should take medicine and record it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡刺大邪，日以小，泄奪其有餘，乃益虛。剽其通，鍼其邪，肌肉親視之，毋有反其真，刺諸陽分肉間。
All acupuncture for treating major evil, should be done in small doses to prevent depletion. Once the qi is connected and the evil is pierced, observe the muscles closely, do not miss the true point, and puncture at the yang channel interstitial spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡刺小邪，日以大，補其不足，乃無害。視其所在，迎之界，遠近盡至，其不得外侵而行之，乃自費，刺分肉間。
Regarding the acupuncture of minor evil qi, it gradually increases in size, supplements what is lacking, and becomes harmless. By observing its location, intercepting at the boundary, near or far without exception, it will not be allowed to invade externally, and will consume itself, piercing between the muscle layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>凡刺熱邪，越而蒼，出遊不歸，乃無病。為開通，辟門戶，使邪得出，病乃已。
All feverish ailments, if they are blue and the patient does not return home, will be cured. To open passages, clear doors and gates, allowing the evil to exit, the disease will have been resolved.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(In modern terms: All fevers that turn into a bluish color and the person does not recover quickly, will eventually subside. By treating the patient and opening up their body's pathways, the illness will improve.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>凡刺寒邪，日以溫，徐往徐來，致其神。門戶已閉，氣不分，虛實得調，其氣存也。
Regarding the treatment of cold pathogenic factors: gradually warm it up day by day, proceed slowly and steadily until it is effective. By the time the door is closed (i.e., the condition has become chronic), the Qi has become stagnant and is not being dispersed; the Real and the False have been distinguished, and the pathogenic factor still remains</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：官鍼奈何？歧伯曰：刺癰者，用鈹鍼；刺大者，用鋒鍼；刺小者，用員利鍼；刺熱者，用纔鍼；刺寒者，用毫鍼也。
Yellow Emperor asked, What about the needles for officials? Huang Di replied, For piercing boils, use a needle with a hollow tip; for piercing large masses, use a needle with a sharp tip; for piercing small ones, use an acupuncture needle; for piercing those affected by heat, use a charred needle; and for piercing those affected by cold, use a fine needle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>請言解論，與天地相應，與四時相副，人參天地，故可為解。下有漸洳，上生葦蒲，此所以知形氣之多少也。陰陽者，寒暑也，熱則滋雨而在上，根莖少汁，人氣在外，皮膚緩，腠理開，血氣減，汗大泄，皮淖澤。寒則地凍水冰，人氣在中，皮膚致，腠理閉，汗不出，血氣強，肉堅澀。當是之時，善行水者，不能往冰，善穿地者，不能擊凍，善用鍼者，亦不能取四厥，血脈凝結，堅搏不往來者，亦未可即柔。故行水者，必待天溫，冰釋凍解，而水可行，地可穿也。人脈猶是也。治厥者，必先熨調和其經，掌與腋，肘與腳，項與脊以調之，火氣已通，血脈乃行。然後視其病，脈淖澤者，刺而平之；堅緊者，破而散之，氣下乃止，此所謂以解結者也。
Please interpret and elucidate, corresponding with heaven and earth, and harmonizing with the four seasons, the human being is a manifestation of the solution. Below there is an incremental wash, above grows reeds and sedges, which is why we know the amount of form and qi. Yin and yang are cold and heat, warmth promotes growth and is located above, with fewer juices in roots and stems, the human being's qi is outside, the skin is supple, and the marrow opens, blood and qi decrease, sweating is excessive, skin is clammy. Cold causes the earth to freeze water into ice, the human being's qi is inside, the skin becomes tough, the marrow closes, sweating does not come out, blood and qi are strong, meat is hardened. At that time, those skilled in swimming cannot go to the ice, those skilled in walking cannot step on frozen ground, and those skilled in using needles cannot take the four extremities, blood vessels become congealed and rigid, and qi does not circulate freely. Therefore, those who walk on water must wait for the weather to warm up, for the ice to melt and thaw, so that water can flow and ground can be walked on. The human being is similar in this regard. To treat extremities, one must first regulate and harmonize their channels, holding at the wrist and elbow, at the ankle and knee, at the neck and spine, to harmonize them. Once fire qi has passed through, blood vessels will circulate. Then, depending on the illness, look at the pulse: clammy and flowing, one should use needles to disperse; tight and rigid, one should pierce and scatter, qi descending will settle, this is called resolving knots.</p>

<p>用鍼之類，在於調氣，氣積於胃，以通營衛，各行其道。宗氣留於海，其下者，注于氣街，其上者，走於息道。故厥在於足，宗氣不下，脈中之血，凝而留止，弗之火調，弗能取之。
Using lancets of this type, regulate the qi, accumulate it in the stomach, and circulate it through the Wei channels to let each follow its own course. The original qi remains in the sea of energy, with the lower part proceeding along the qi street and the upper part traveling on the Xu channel. Therefore, the governance is located at the feet, the original qi does not descend, the blood in the vessels coagulates and stops, unable to warm or extract it.</p>

<p>用鍼者，必先察其經絡之實虛，切而循之，按而彈之，視其應動者，乃後取之而下之。六經調者，謂之不病，雖病，謂之自已也。一經上實下虛而不通者，此必有橫絡盛加於大經，令之不通，視而寫之，此所謂解結也。
The physician who uses the lancet must first examine the truth of the patient's veins and arteries, cutting along them, pressing and probing them, observing their responses, and then extracting them. The skilled practitioner of the six canons calls this state not ill, while for those who are ill, he says it is what it is. When one meridian is full on top and empty below without communication, there must be excessive accumulation in the main meridian, leading to non-communication; observe and write this down as resolving knots.</p>

<p>上寒下熱，先刺其項太陽，久留之，已刺則熨項與肩胛，令熱下合乃止，此所謂推而上之者也。上熱下寒，視其虛脈而陷之於經絡者，取之，氣下乃止，此所謂引而下之者也。
Above cold below heat, first pierce the back of the shoulder with the sun, and let it remain for a long time. After puncturing, press the shoulder and shoulder blades to disperse the heat, stopping when it reaches its destination. This is called pushing upwards. Above heat below cold, observe the empty pulse and sink it into the channels. Take it out, and the Qi will stop at the bottom. This is called pulling down.</p>

<p>大熱遍身，狂而妄見妄聞妄言，視足陽明及大絡取之，虛者補之，血而實者寫之。因其偃臥，居其頭前，以兩手四指挾按頸動脈，久持之，卷而切，推下至缺盆中，而復止如前，熱去乃止，此所謂推而散之者也。
Large heat covers the body, with madness and delusions of sight, hearing, and speech. By looking at the sole of the foot and pressing on the great vessels, filling in empty areas and writing on solid ones. Then laying it down, placing it in front of the head, using both hands to clasp and press the carotid artery, holding for a long time, then rolling, cutting, and pushing it back into the hollow, stopping again as before. The heat subsides when stopped, this is called pushing and dispersing.</p>

<p>黃帝曰：有一脈生數十病者，或痛，或癰，或熱，或寒，或癢，或痺，或不仁，變化無窮，其故何也？歧伯曰：此皆邪氣之所生也。黃帝曰：余聞氣者，有真氣，有正氣，有邪氣。何謂真氣？歧伯曰：真氣者，所受於天，與穀氣并而充身也。正氣者，正風也，從一方來，非實風，又非虛風也。邪氣者，虛風之賊傷人也，其中人也深，不能自去。正風者，其中人也淺，合而自去，其氣來柔弱，不能勝真氣，故自去。
Yellow Emperor said: There is one pulse that has several tens of diseases, sometimes painful, sometimes swollen, sometimes feverish, sometimes cold, sometimes urinary issues, sometimes paralysis, and sometimes lacks tenderness. The manifestations are countless; what is the reason for this? The Duke of Zhou replied: All of these are due to pathogenic Qi. Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that Qi has true Qi, righteous Qi, and pathogenic Qi. What is true Qi? The Duke of Zhou replied: True Qi is what one receives from Heaven and blends with the grain Qi, nourishing the body. Righteous Qi is the correct breath that comes from one direction. It is not real or virtual wind; rather it is an energy that can be harmonized and leaves on its own accord. The energy in pathogenic Qi is a malicious harm to people, deeply rooted within them, and cannot leave by itself. Righteous Qi's energy is shallowly rooted within people, and when it is harmonized, it leaves on its own accord; its Qi is gentle and weak, unable to overcome true Qi, so it leaves.</p>

<p>虛邪之中人也，洒晰動形，起毫毛而發腠理。其入深，內搏於骨，則為骨痺；搏於筋，則為筋攣；搏於脈中，則為血閉，不通則為癰。搏於肉，與衛氣相搏，陽勝者，則為熱，陰勝者，則為寒。寒則真氣去，去則虛，虛則寒搏於皮膚之間。其氣外發，腠理開，毫毛搖，氣往來行，則為痒。留而不去，則痺。衛氣不行，則為不仁。
A person with vacuity and evil in the interior has clear, distinct movements and hairs standing on end. If it goes deep into the bones, it is bone pain; if into the muscles, it is muscle tension; if into the blood vessels, it is blocked blood, and if not passing through, it becomes a swelling. Struggling with the flesh, it interferes with the defensive Qi, and if yang prevails, it results in heat, while if yin prevails, it results in cold. Cold causes true Qi to depart, which leads to vacuity, and vacuity allows cold to struggle between the skin and flesh. Its energy is manifested externally, with the hair standing on end, the pulse opening, and the Qi going back and forth, resulting in itching. If left untreated, it becomes pain. Blockage of defensive Qi results in lack of compassion.</p>

<p>虛邪偏容於身半，其入深，內居榮衛，榮衛稍衰，則真氣去，邪氣獨留，發為偏枯。其邪氣淺者，脈偏痛。
The text describes a situation where an imbalance in the body's vital energy arises due to external pathogenic factors and inner deficiency. This condition starts shallowly affecting the body, particularly around the waist area, and as it progresses deeper, it impacts the honor guards (an internal organ system), which leads to the decline of genuine Qi and the presence of pathogenic Qi alone. In the latter stage, this results in a partial withering or imbalance of energy flow. When this condition is superficial, it manifests as pain in the pulse's offset or affected area</p>

<p>虛邪之入于身也深，寒與熱相搏，久留而內著，寒勝其熱，則骨疼肉枯；熱勝其寒，則爛肉腐肌為膿，內傷骨，內傷骨為骨蝕。有所疾前筋，筋屈不得伸，邪氣居其間而不反，發為筋溜。有所結，氣歸之，衛氣留之，不得反，津液久留，合而為腸溜。久者，數歲乃成，以手按之柔，已有所結，氣歸之，津液留之，邪氣中之，凝結日以易甚，連以聚居，為昔瘤。以手按之堅，有所結，深中骨，氣因於骨，骨與氣并，日以益大，則為骨疽。有所結，中於肉，宗氣歸之，邪留而不去，有熱則化而為膿，無熱則為肉疽。凡此數氣者，其發無常處，而有常名也。
The pathology of the interior is profound, as cold and heat struggle within. Prolonged exposure leads to internal damage; cold prevailing over heat causes bones to ache and muscles to wither, while heat prevailing over cold results in muscles rotting and flesh decomposing into ulcers, damaging both bone and marrow; this ultimately leads to the bone being eaten away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When there is an acute attack at the tendons, tendons become tense and unable to stretch. The pathogenic Qi occupies a middle position and does not disperse, resulting in tendon convulsions.</p>
<p>When there is a nodule or mass, Qi returns but does not disperse, and defensive Qi lingers without dispersing; bodily fluids accumulate, eventually forming an abscess. Prolonged over time, this can develop into a lump by the age of several years. When pressed with the hand, it is palpable as a nodule, Qi returns and fluid lingers, and pathogenic Qi congeals day by day, gradually massing and gathering to form a tumor.</p>
<p>When pressed with the hand and it feels hard, there is a nodule deep within the bone, Qi penetrates the bone, and bone and Qi coalesce, gradually increasing in size until it becomes a bone abscess. When there is a nodule within the flesh, vital Qi returns to it, pathogenic Qi lingers without dispersing, and if there is heat, it transforms into pus; if there is no heat, it becomes a flesh abscess. All such pathological conditions arise unpredictably but have constant names</p>
