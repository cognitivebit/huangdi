<p>黃帝問于歧伯曰：人之血氣精神者，所以奉生而周於性命者也；經脈者，所以行血氣而營陰陽、濡筋骨，利關節者也；衛氣者，所以溫分肉，充皮膚，肥腠理，司開闔者也；志意者，所以御精神，收魂魄，適寒溫，和喜怒者也。是故血和則經脈流行，營復陰陽，筋骨勁強，關節清利矣；衛氣和則分肉解利，皮膚調柔，腠理致密矣；志意和則精神專直，魂魄不散，悔怒不起，五藏不受邪矣；寒溫和則六府化穀，風痺不作，經脈通利，肢節得安矣，此人之常平也。五藏者，所以藏精神血氣魂魄者也；六府者，所以化水穀而行津液者也。此人之所以具受於天也，無愚智賢不肖，無以相倚也。然有其獨盡天壽，而無邪僻之病，百年不衰，雖犯風雨卒寒大暑，猶有弗能害也；有其不離屏蔽室內，無怵惕之恐，然猶不免於病，何也？願聞其故。
Emperor Yellow asked Confucius, The human body contains blood, qi, and spirit; the meridians are the channels for the circulation of blood and qi, regulating yin and yang and nourishing the tendons and bones. The Wei qi is used to warm the organs, nourish the skin, and moisturize the muscles and faculties, and control opening and closing. Intention or spirit is what maintains consciousness, collects the soul, adjusts to cold and heat, and harmonizes joy and anger. Therefore, when blood is balanced, the meridians flow smoothly, yin and yang are regulated, tendons and bones have strength, and joints are clear and nourished. When Wei qi is balanced, the muscles distribute and refine, the skin becomes soft and supple, sinews are strengthened, and the organs function properly without being invaded by evil. When intention or spirit is balanced, consciousness is focused and direct, the soul does not scatter, anger does not arise, and the five organs do not suffer from evil influences. Cold and heat are balanced, the six departments transform grains and regulate fluids, wind stroke does not occur, and the meridians flow smoothly, and joints are at peace. This is the natural equilibrium of the human body. The five organs house the spirit, blood, and soul. The six departments regulate the transformation of water and grains. This person's ability to receive from heaven is complete, without folly or lack of wisdom. Although they possess an independent longevity that is free from strange diseases and does not wither over a hundred years, even if they encounter wind, rain, sudden cold, or intense heat, they are still unable to be harmed. How can it be that they do not leave their secluded room and are still prone to illness? I wish to know the reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>歧伯對曰：窘乎哉問也。五藏者，所以參天地，副陰陽，而運四時，化五節者也；五藏者，固有小大、高下、堅脆、端正、偏傾者，六府亦有小大、長短、厚薄、結直、緩急。凡此二十五者，各不同，或善或惡，或吉或凶，請言其方。
Duke Zhou replied, It is indeed a difficult question. The Five Canons serve to harmonize heaven and earth, complement yin and yang, and regulate the four seasons and nurture the five cycles. The Five Canons have their own small and large, high and low, firm and brittle, upright and tilted, and six ministries also have their own small and large, long and short, thick and thin, knotted and smooth, and slow and fast aspects. All of these twenty-five aspects are different from one another and may be good or bad, auspicious or inauspicious; I ask about the method for understanding them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>心小則安，邪弗能傷，易傷以憂；心大則憂，不能傷，易傷於邪。心高則滿於肺中，悗而善忘，難開以言；心下，則藏外，易傷於寒，易恐以言。心堅，則藏安守固；心脆則善病消癉熱中。心端正，則和利難傷；心偏傾則操持不一，無守司也。
A small heart is secure, evil cannot harm it, and one may be upset by injury; a great heart is troubled, cannot be harmed, and may be injured by evil. A high heart is filled with the lungs, becomes depressed and easily forgets, and finds it difficult to speak. A low heart, then, is outside the womb, easily injured by cold, and is prone to fear in speech. A firm heart is safe and securely guarded; a brittle heart is prone to illness and sweating during fever. A calm and upright heart brings harmony and benefits others, while a heart that leans one way or the other leads to inconsistency in holding onto things and lacks protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>肺小，則少飲，不病喘喝；肺大則多飲，善病胸痺、喉痺、逆氣。肺高，則上氣，肩息咳；肺下則居賁迫肺，善脅下痛。肺堅則不病，咳上氣；肺脆，則苦病消痺易傷。肺端正，則和利難傷；肺偏傾，則胸偏痛也。
If the lung is small, one should drink less and not suffer from cough or wheezing; if the lung is large, one should drink more and be prone to diseases such as chest pain, throat pain, and qi reversal. If the lung is high, one will have qi rising, causing shoulder pain and coughing; if the lung is low, one will suffer from phlegm accumulating and pressuring the lung, often experiencing lower abdominal pain. If the lung is firm, there will be no disease and coughing with qi rising; if the lung is brittle, there will be difficult-to-treat diseases of pain and numbness that easily lead to injury. If the lung is balanced, one can avoid difficult situations; if the lung is leaning to one side, chest pain on that side will result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>肺小則藏安，無脅下之病；肝大則逼胃迫咽，迫咽則苦膈中，且脅下痛。肝高，則上支賁切，脅挽為息賁；肝下則逼胃脅下空，脅下空則易受邪。肝堅則藏安難傷；肝脆則善病消痺，易傷。肝端正，則和利難傷；肝偏傾，則脅下痛也。
If the lungs are small, they will be safe and have no diseases beneath them; if the liver is large, it will force the stomach upward and force the throat, causing bitterness in the middle and a painful sensation below. If the liver is high, there will be pain in the diaphragm and difficulty breathing; if the liver is low, it will force the stomach below and cause the space below to be easily invaded by pathogens. If the liver is firm, it will be difficult to harm the safe haven; if the liver is soft, it is good at resolving diseases and relieving pain but is prone to injury. If the liver is properly positioned, it is difficult to cause harm; if the liver is tilted, there will be pain below.
Note: This translation may not be an accurate literal translation of the original text due to the complexity and abstract nature of classical Chinese literature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>脾小，則藏安，難傷於邪也；脾大，則苦湊䏚而痛，不能疾行。脾高，則䏚引季脅而痛；脾下則下歸於大腸，下加於大腸，則藏苦受邪。脾堅，則藏安難傷；脾脆，則善病消痺易傷。脾端正，則和利難傷；脾偏傾，則善滿善脹也。
When the spleen is small, it hides securely and is difficult to harm by evil; when the spleen is large, it causes great distress and pain, unable to move quickly. When the spleen is high, it refers to the ribs and causes pain; when the spleen is low, it returns to the large intestine, adding to the large intestine, causing the organs to suffer from evil qi. The spleen is firm, then it hides securely and is difficult to harm; the spleen is fragile, then it excels at treating diseases, easing paralysis, and being easily harmed. When the spleen is upright and correct, then it is easy to avoid harm; when the spleen inclines to one side, then it excels at fullness and bloating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>腎小，則藏安難傷；腎大，則善病腰痛，不可以俛仰，易傷以邪。腎高，則苦背膂痛，不可以俛仰；腎下則腰尻痛，不可以俛仰，為狐疝。腎堅，則不病腰背痛；腎脆，則善病消癉，易傷。腎端正，則和利難傷；腎偏傾，則苦腰尻痛也。凡此二十五變者，人之所苦常病。
If the liver is small, it is difficult to keep safe and prone to injury; if the liver is enlarged, one is good at treating diseases of the waist, but cannot bend over, and is prone to injury from evil. If the liver is high, there will be painful spasms in the back, one cannot bend over, and it is easy to be injured by evil spirits. If the liver is low, there will be pain in the waist and tailbone, one cannot bend over, and it leads to sciatica. If the liver is hard, one does not get sick with lower back pain; if the liver is brittle, one is good at treating diseases of sweating and is prone to injury. If the liver is well-positioned, it is difficult to be injured; if the liver is tilted, one will suffer from painful waist and tailbone. All these twenty-five transformations are the common ailments that people often experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃帝曰：何以知其然也？歧伯曰：赤色小理者，心小；麤理者，心大。無𩩲𩨗者，心高；𩩲𩨗小、短、舉者，心下。𩩲𩨗長者，心下堅；𩩲𩨗弱小以薄者，心脆。𩩲𩨗直下不舉者，心端正；𩩲𩨗倚一方者，心偏傾也。
Yellow Emperor said, How do we know that it is so? Duke of Zhou replied, In the case of someone who has a small amount of red coloring, their heart is small. In the case of someone with a large amount of yellow coloring, their heart is large. If they have no blue coloring at all, then their heart is high. For someone who has a little bit of blue coloring, it's shallow. For someone who has long and deep blue coloring, their heart is low and firm. If the blue coloring is weak and small, their heart is fragile. If they have no blue coloring at all but only straight down without lifting it, then their heart is upright and orderly. If they lean on one side, then their heart is inclined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>白色小理者，肺小；麤理者，肺大。巨肩反膺陷喉者，肺高；合腋張脅者，肺下。好肩背厚者，肺堅；肩背薄者，肺脆。背膺厚者，肺端正；脅偏疏者，肺偏傾也。
One who is small and white, the lungs are small; one with hair, the lungs are large. One with a protruding collarbone sinking into the throat, the lungs are high; one with shoulders drawn together and chest pressing inwards, the lungs are low. One with broad and thick shoulders, the lungs are firm; one with narrow and thin shoulders, the lungs are brittle. One with thick and fleshy waist, the lungs are well-centered; one with a shifted and dispersed breast, the lungs lean to one side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>青色小理者，肝小；麤理者，肝大。廣胸反骹者，肝高；合脅兔骹者，肝下。胸脅好者，肝堅；脅骨弱者，肝脆。膺腹好相得者，肝端正；脅骨偏舉者，肝偏傾也。
The person who is slender and of a light complexion, the liver is small; the person with a stout build, the liver is large. The one with broad chest and hunched back, the liver is high; the one with merged heart and hunchback, the liver is low. The good-looking chest and backbone, the liver is firm; the weak backbone, the liver is brittle. The pairing of chest and backbone are harmonious, the liver is balanced; the backbone leaning to one side, the liver is tilted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黃色小理者，脾小；麤理者，脾大。揭唇者，脾高；唇下縱者，脾下。唇堅者，脾堅；唇大而不堅者，脾脆。唇上下好者，脾端正；唇偏舉者，脾偏傾也。
The person who has a yellow complexion, the spleen is weak; the person with thin hair, the spleen is enlarged. The person who licks their lips, the spleen is high; the person whose lower lip hangs down, the spleen is low. The person with rigid lips, the spleen is stiff; the person with swollen lips but not rigid, the spleen is brittle. The person with well-aligned lips and chin, the spleen is harmonious; the person whose lips are asymmetrical, the spleen is leaning to one side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>黑色小理者，腎小；麤理者，腎大。高耳者，腎高；耳後陷者，腎下。耳堅者，腎堅；耳薄不堅者，腎脆。耳好前居牙車者，腎端正；耳偏高者，腎偏傾也。凡此諸變者，持則安，減則病也。
The black and small thinker has a small liver; the white and large thinker has a large liver. The high eared one has a high liver; the eared one with a sunken posterior has a low liver. The hard of hearing has a firm liver; the not hard of hearing has a brittle liver. The one who likes the front part of the ear and the tooth-comb has a well-ordered liver; the one whose ears are inclined to one side has a tilted liver. All these changes, if maintained, there will be security; if reduced, there will be disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>帝曰：善。然非余之所問也，願聞人之有不可病者，至盡天壽，雖有深擾大恐，怵惕之志，猶不能減也，甚寒大熱，不能傷也；其有不離屏蔽室內，又無怵惕之恐，然不免於病者，何也？願聞其故。歧伯曰：五藏六府，邪之舍也，請言其故。五藏皆小者，少病，苦憔心，大愁擾；五藏皆大者，緩於事，難使以擾。五藏皆高者，好高舉措；五藏皆下者，好出人下。五藏皆堅者，無病；五藏皆脆者，不離於病。五藏皆端正者，和利得人心；五藏皆偏傾者，邪心而善盜，不可以為人平，反復言語也。
Emperor: Good. But this is not what I asked about. I would like to hear about people who have no incurable diseases, reaching a long lifespan, even though they may experience deep anxiety and great fear, and their minds may still not be able to be reduced. They may feel cold or feverish, but cannot be hurt. Those who do not leave the confines of their rooms and do not experience such anxiety, what is the reason for them still getting sick? I would like to hear the cause. Duke Huan replied: The five organs and six palaces are where evil resides; please explain the cause. Each of the five organs is small, causing less illness but more anxiety in the heart, causing worry. Each of the five organs is large, making them more patient and difficult to disturb. Each of the five organs is high, enjoying elevated gestures; each of the five organs is low, enjoying humbling others. Each of the five organs is strong, without illness; each of the five organs is fragile, not leaving their sickness. Each of the five organs is upright and righteous, bringing harmony to people's hearts; each of the five organs is crooked, harboring evil intentions and being skilled at theft, cannot be made fair for others, and constantly speak words.</p>

<p>黃帝曰：願聞六府之應。歧伯答曰：肺合大腸，大腸者，皮其應；心合小腸，小腸者，脈其應；肝合膽，膽者，筋其應；脾合胃，胃者，肉其應；腎合三焦膀胱，三焦膀胱者，腠理毫毛其應。
Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the correspondence of the six ministries. Duke of Shao replied: The Lung combines with the large intestine, the large intestine being the organ of correspondence; the Heart combines with the small intestine, the small intestine being the organ of the pulse; the Liver combines with the gallbladder, the gallbladder being the organ of the tendons; the Spleen combines with the stomach, the stomach being the organ of the flesh; the Kidney combines with the three burners and bladder, the three burners and bladder being the organs of the channels, hair, and pores.</p>

<p>黃帝曰：應之奈何？歧伯曰：肺應皮。皮厚者，大腸厚，皮薄者，大腸薄；皮緩，腹裏大者，大腸大而長；皮急者，大腸急而短；皮滑者，大腸直；皮肉不相離者，大腸結。
Yellow Emperor said: What should be done in such case? Duke of Shou replied: The lung corresponds to the skin. If the skin is thick, the large intestine is also thick; if the skin is thin, the large intestine is also thin. If the skin is relaxed and the abdomen is enlarged, the large intestine will be enlarged and long; if the skin is tense, the large intestine will be short and narrow; if the skin is slippery, the large intestine will be straight; if the skin and flesh do not separate from each other, the large intestine will form knots.</p>

<p>心應脈，皮厚者，脈厚，脈厚者，小腸厚；皮薄者，脈薄，脈薄者，小腸薄；皮緩者，脈緩，脈緩者，小腸大而長；皮薄而脈沖小者，小腸小而短。諸陽經脈皆多紆屈者，小腸結。
The heart responds to the pulse; if the skin is thick, then the pulse is thick and those with a thick pulse have a thick small intestine. If the skin is thin, then the pulse is weak, and those with a weak pulse have a weak small intestine. If the skin is slack, then the pulse is slack and those with a slack pulse have an enlarged, elongated small intestine. If the skin is thin and the pulse is rebellious and small, then the small intestine is small and short. All of the yang channels' pulses tend to be tangled when there is a small intestine knot.</p>

<p>脾應肉，肉䐃堅大者，胃厚；肉䐃么者，胃薄。肉䐃小而么者，胃不堅；肉膕不稱身者，胃下，胃下者，下管約不利。肉脾不堅者，胃緩；肉䐃無小裏累者，胃急。肉䐃多少裏累者，胃結，胃結者，上管約不利也。
The spleen acts on flesh, flesh that is hard and substantial makes the stomach thick; flesh that is tender makes the stomach thin. Flesh that is small and tender makes the stomach not firm; flesh that does not fill the body makes the stomach below, and the below of the stomach is not advantageous to the large intestine. The spleen without firmness makes the stomach mild; flesh without much internal accumulation makes the stomach hurry. Flesh with much internal accumulation makes the stomach form lumps, and the lumps of the stomach are not advantageous to the large intestine also.</p>

<p>肝應爪，爪厚色黃者，膽厚；爪薄色紅者，膽薄；爪堅色青者，膽急；爪濡色赤者，膽緩；爪直色白無約者，膽直；爪惡色黑多紋者，膽結也。
The liver influences the nails. Those with thick, yellow-colored nails have a robust constitution. Those with thin, red-colored nails are frail. Those with hard, green-colored nails are anxious. Those with damp, red-colored nails are slow to act. Those with straight, white-colored nails without blemishes indicate a straightforward disposition. Those with evil-looking, black and multi-striped nails have accumulated pathogenic factors within the body</p>

<p>腎應骨，密理厚皮者，三焦膀胱厚；麤理薄皮者，三焦膀胱薄。疏腠理者，三焦膀胱緩；皮急而無毫毛者，三焦膀胱急。毫毛美而麤者，三焦膀胱直，稀毫毛者，三焦膀胱結也。
The gallbladder, spleen, and stomach are all related to the pancreas. In cases where the tendons are strong and the mind is deep, the organs of the three burners and bladder are strong; in cases where the tendons are weak and the skin is thin, the organs of the three burners and bladder are weak. When the pores are open and the tendons are weak, the organs of the three burners and bladder become sluggish. When the skin is tight and there are no hairs, the organs of the three burners and bladder become urgent. Hairs that are beautiful and coarse indicate that the organs of the three burners and bladder are straight; hairs that are sparse indicate that the organs of the three burners and bladder are knotted.</p>

<p>黃帝曰：厚薄美惡，皆有形，願聞其所病。歧伯答曰：視其外應，以知其內藏，則知所病矣。
Yellow Emperor said: Thick and thin are beautiful, and ugliness is also in form. I wish to hear the illness. Huzi (Huang Di's courtier) answered: By observing its outer manifestation, one can know its inner essence, thus knowing the illness.</p>
